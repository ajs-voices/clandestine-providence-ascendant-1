# Incomplete Puzzles

I watched him set the laptop up and fire it up without a problem until the password screen flashed on.  He looked to me and waited for me to type it in.  I handed Dorian a card and pointed to a set of words on it.  "All lowercase no spaces."

Dorian shook his head.  "Anyone could guess that."

I grinned.  "It's my laptop not some super secret thing.  The other passwords are more cryptic."

Dorian just shook his head and typed it in.  He found what he was looking for and started a program on my computer I hadn't ever used. It was some annotation software apparently.  Dorian pecked away at the keys and used the track pad like it was a foreigh object.   I watched until I figured out what he was doing.  My stomach rumbled and he pushed his tray in front of me.  "Eat."

I groaned and he looked up from the screen and gave me that look that said I had better or else... I'd have liked to have known what that or else was that gave him that twinkle in his eye.  I ate the mashed potatoes and pulled the skin off the fried chicken and finished what was left of the canned vegetables Dorian had taken.  I tried not to gag on any of it.  I knew my stomach was going to pay for it later.

Dorian turned the computer screen more in my direction and he'd plotted out all the locations of the pattern fragments we'd seen.  They tugged at a memory but I couldn't quite remember where I'd seen them.  They weren't fitting right.

"What's wrong?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know.  They don't fit right.  I know peices are missing but they look inside out.  I don't know how to explain it."

Dorian started up another program from the Venatori servers and started pulling in the drawings I had made on the wall.  He separated each patter and let them float inside the program, it kinda looked like a puzzle to put together.  And that was exactly what it was.  

I pulled the laptop closer to me and started moving peices around.  This was my thing.  I could see what I wanted but I needed to turn peices in a way they just didn't logically move.  Dorian was watching me work and playing footsy with me under the table.  I was happily ignoring him and he was trying to distract me.  A happy game.  But Dorian saw that I'd stopped working and asked, "What's wrong?"

"I can't move the peices like I want."

Dorian took the laptop from me and started manipulating the images.  "How do you want it positioned?"

"Show me how?"  Dorian moved his hands and places his over mine and moved my fingers with a gentle touch.  It wasn't that hard, now that I knew how.  Dorian lifted his fingers and watched me.

"What are you doing?"  He asked.

"Putting together a puzzle with missing peices."  Dorian moved around to my side of the table so it was easier to do this.  His leg pressed against mine and I looked at him.  "You..."  I was lost for words.  

Dorian grinned at me.  "Me?"

I put my hand on his leg and smiled and went back to work.  Thankfully he was on my left so I could still work well with one hand.  His hand patted mine and remained there entwined with my fingers.  

I had the peices where I thought they went but they still looked
