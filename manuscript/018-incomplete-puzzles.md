## Incomplete Puzzles

I watched him set the laptop up and fire it up without a problem until the password screen flashed on.  He looked to me and waited for me to type it in.  I handed Dorian a card and pointed to a set of words on it.  "All lowercase no spaces."

Dorian shook his head.  "Anyone could guess that."

I grinned.  "It's my laptop not some super secret thing.  The other passwords are more cryptic."

Dorian just shook his head and typed it in.  He found what he was looking for and started a program on my computer I hadn't ever used. It was some annotation software apparently.  Dorian pecked away at the keys and used the track pad like it was a foreigh object.   I watched until I figured out what he was doing.  My stomach rumbled and he pushed his tray in front of me.  "Eat."

I groaned and he looked up from the screen and gave me that look that said I had better or else... I'd have liked to have known what that or else was that gave him that twinkle in his eye.  I ate the mashed potatoes and pulled the skin off the fried chicken and finished what was left of the canned vegetables Dorian had taken.  I tried not to gag on any of it.  I knew my stomach was going to pay for it later.

Dorian turned the computer screen more in my direction and he'd plotted out all the locations of the pattern fragments we'd seen.  They tugged at a memory but I couldn't quite remember where I'd seen them.  They weren't fitting right.

"What's wrong?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know.  They don't fit right.  I know peices are missing but they look inside out.  I don't know how to explain it."

Dorian started up another program from the Venatori servers and started pulling in the drawings I had made on the wall.  He separated each patter and let them float inside the program, it kinda looked like a puzzle to put together.  And that was exactly what it was.  

I pulled the laptop closer to me and started moving peices around.  This was my thing.  I could see what I wanted but I needed to turn peices in a way they just didn't logically move.  Dorian was watching me work and playing footsy with me under the table.  I was happily ignoring him and he was trying to distract me.  A happy game.  But Dorian saw that I'd stopped working and asked, "What's wrong?"

"I can't move the peices like I want."

Dorian took the laptop from me and started manipulating the images.  "How do you want it positioned?"

"Show me how?"  Dorian moved his hands and places his over mine and moved my fingers with a gentle touch.  It wasn't that hard, now that I knew how.  Dorian lifted his fingers and watched me.

"What are you doing?"  He asked.

"Putting together a puzzle with missing peices."  Dorian moved around to my side of the table so it was easier to do this.  His leg pressed against mine and I looked at him.  "You..."  I was lost for words.  

Dorian grinned at me.  "Me?"

I put my hand on his leg and smiled and went back to work.  Thankfully he was on my left so I could still work well with one hand.  His hand patted mine and remained there entwined with my fingers.  

I had the peices where I thought they went but they still looked wrong but I don't know how that could be.  I shook my head.  "Still wrong somehow.  I should know this."

Dorian closed the laptop lid with my fingers still resting on the keyboard.  "Let it marinate for a while. It'll come to you."

I grinned at him.  "Are you still babysitting me?"

Dorian nodded very serious like.  "Yes.  Why?"

"I need to go for a run."  Some of the color left Dorian's face and he frowned.

But he turned it quickly into a joke.  "In these shoes.  I think not."

"I'll be gone an hour or so.  I have some anxiety issues to work out so it might be a little longer."

Dorian looked down at his watch.  "Stop by my apartment when you are done."  He loooked up at me.  "Please, or in two hours I'll send the calvary after you to make sure you are alright."

I nodded. "Alright.  We've done one of the five things on our list.  We can finished the others then?"

Dorian smiled.  "I'll walk you to your destination we can talk about something pressing on my mind."

"Alright."  I started packing up my laptop bag and all the papers we had strewn about on the table.  The cafeteria was nearly empty - it was never completely empty.  The food service might be over but the coffee machines were always on and people worked al hours of the day here only self service items were available now.  I hadn't realized how late it really was.

Dorian walked with me towards the door befor he spoke in a barely audible whispere.   "Who is Adrian?"  I froze.  Dorian stopped and turned and looked at me. "When I was talking with Bonnie at the diner she mentioned him."

I could feel the blood draining from my face and my hands were ice cold.  I took a deep breath and started walking, we needed someplace quiet to talk now.  This wasn't a cooridor talk.  I found an empty room that wasn't used at the time and I showed Dorian in.  "Is something wrong?"

I put up a ward against eavesdropping.  It wasn't a topic I wanted everyone in the world to know.  I shook my head.  I tried to speak but my mouth had suddenly gone dry.  Dorian used it to ask more questions.  "You don't look like you want to talk about it.  Bonnie said that you were broken during/after your abuser until you met Adrian..."

He paused unsure of where he was going after that.  "I will tell you anything.  I just am not sure you are ready for that tidbit of information so soon into whatever we have going on."

"That bad?"  Dorian asked and sat on the corner of the desk one leg stretched on in front of him the other proped up on the table leg.  

I was trying to avoid looking Dorian in the eyes.  "Adiran is one of the few long term relationships I've had."

"So another child abuser?"

I shook my head.  "Adrian didn't abuse me no matter what you think."  I was angry at the fact that he was judging my friend - my salvation.  "If it weren't for Adrian and Margo's work togethere I'd still be that broken little boy.  I'd still be paralyzed under someone's influece unable to say no.  Unable to break the chains that were ingrained in me so young."

There was sympathy on Dorian's face.  I didn't need his pity.  I turned around.  I didn't want to see that look on his face - on anyone's face but definitely not his.  I continued.  "I went to a club, we all did.  Jace, me, Mia, and a few of her friends.  It was all about finding sex.  Not with each other.  I met a man - a werewolf actually.  He was into bondage and I had agreed.  I was underage, but that didn't seem to bother him too much.  I laid out my rules and he agreed.  We didn't know each other's name - it's the way I like it."

I paused to collect my thoughts.  "He pinned me against the wall and I froze.  The moment my shoulders touched I was the zombie like kid that Garrett had created.  It still happens now when I'm not prepared for it.  But he is a therapist, he knew exactly what was happening.  He stopped and started asking me questions.  Things like does this happen often.  Has anyone ever done anything against your will."

"I could only answer in one word sentences, but I was truthful.  I had to be in that state.  He asked me if I was getting help and when I said yes he asked for her number and he immediately called her while I stood still pressed up against the wall like he'd left me.  He explained things and he and Margo argued but I wasn't paying attention.  He told me when he hung up that he'd help me - for a fee."

"I only nodded but he released me from my holding.  He told me.  'No one should have that over your'.  He introduced himself as Adrian Lupita and we got started right away.  He taught me the safe words - taught me how to say no when I lost control due to fear.  He helped me."

I looked up expecting to see the wall and not Dorian, but there he was standing in front of me, whiping away a tear that had fallen and was sliding down my cheek.  He was gentle and careful not to make more of a mess.  He whispered, "Did you sleep with him?"

I nodded.  "A couple times.  But it wasn't like that.  And it wasn't until I had full control of my own self.  He showed me things."

"Things?"


I took a deep breath.  "How to be a dominate or a submissive depending on who I was with without giving up complete control to the other.  He showed me sex didn't have to hurt to be pleasurable."  I was looking at Dorian's deep blue eyes when I finished.  "He taught me it's okay to be weak sometimes."

Dorian stared at me.  "Nox..."  He wrapped his arms around me.  He pittied me.  He pittied my childhood.  I didn't return the warm gesture.  I wanted to but it was pity that promptd it.  I hated being pittied.

Dorian unwound his arms from me with a frown, "What's wrong?"

"You pity me."  I said it with so much venom Dorian flinched.

"It's a natural reaction to a sad upbringing.  I'm sorry you can see that.  It doesn't change anything."

"Nothing?  How could it not?  According to you I've been raped.  I've had sexual encounters you can't even imagine because it was what I thought love was.  It was how I felt close to someone without getting emotionally hurt.  How does that not affect anything?"

Dorian looked down at his feet.  "I can't imagine your life before.  Honestly Nox, it pisses me off that someone - anyone - treated you like this. Could treat anyone like this.  Someone should have been watching you - looking out for you."

"What could they do Dorian?  I had that.  I snuck out behind their back to do the things I wanted.  I was the one doing wrong because it felt good.  I fucked up my life.  Now I get to deal with it."

"It still changes nothing.  Without those experiences you wouldn't be who you are.  There is no point in worrying about the past.  Worrying whether or not you will fall back into those comforting memories.  If you do you do and we'll deal with it.  But this person right here."  He grabbed my shoulders.  "This person is a good man.  Yes I feel bad about your upbringing.  But I'm smart enough to realize that it's what shaped you.  And you yourself said that this was new.  I'm new to you.  That means you don't want what you had before you."  He pulled me close to him, his forehead pressed against mine.  "I'm okay with that."  

I blinked at him unable to say anything.  My anger and memories were fadng being this close to his calm center.  The scent of vanilla and cinamon permated the air around Dorian and I could feel muscles losen that I hadn't known were tight.  I kissed Dorian.  My breath quickened with each beat of my racing heart.  My body ached for him.  Ached for his fingers against my skin.  But Dorian pulled away first with a smile, "You were going for a run?"

I nodded.  "I should."

Dorian nodded. "I'm not sorry I asked Nox.  I'm concerned but not about your past."

"What are you worried about?"

Dorian took my arm and started walking towards the door.  "Things you don't need to worry about Nox.  It's not you that concerns me.  It's myself."

I stopped and Dorian turned to look back at me.  "Don't hide from me Dorian.  I won't lie to you, or hide from you.  I will answer anything you need to know.  Tell you everything.  I can't deal with games and new feelings.  I can't."

Dorian nodded and took a step towards me and took my arm again and we left the room before he continued.  "I'm worried I'm not enough for you.  I have no where near the experiences you do."

I laughed.  "You think any of that matters to me?"  I stopped Dorian pushed him up against the wall and pressed my body against him.  I could feel his warmth and my only thought was to want to have him naked under my hands.  I leaned in and whispered in his ear.  "No one.  And I mean no one has ever made me feel the way you make me feel.  I'm scared and excited at the same time. I think about kissing you and my knees go weak.  The thought that you might want me makes my heart soar."

Dorian asked, "Might?  There is no might in this equation Nox."

I smiled.  "You are enough Dorian.  Always enough. More than enough."

He kissed me in the hallway. It was long and passionate and I know I felt at least one person brush my back as they hurried past us.  We pulled apart breathless and smiling and started back down the path we were to the gym holding hands.  The silence wasn't awkward.  The looks we received made Dorian tense until they were behind us.  No one said anything.  No one stopped us to tell us how wrong this was.  Men with men didn't happen often in the Venatori but it did happen - ironically women with women happened more often.  But I felt happy - happier than I had ever felt in my life.
