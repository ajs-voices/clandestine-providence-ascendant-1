## Fear of Heights

Jace drove into New York and I sat in the back with the kids again.  They chattered at me and distracted me from the upcoming events that were making butterflies leap in my stomach.  I hadn't managed to grab anything to eat but Naya thought for me and picked up a few peices of bacon and pancakes for me.  She said the eggs were too messy for the car.  I nibbled at the pancakes and gave the kids the bacon to share between them.  

As we got out of the car they both gave me a hug with geasey finger tips and Jace had to hold my jacket while I got the smears off with air and water.  Mia laughed.  "Fancy dry cleaning."

I shrugged, it was nothing.  "You do what you have to in the field."

Jace laughed.  "How often did you need your suit cleaned and pressed in the field?"

I frowned.  "Funerals."

The humor drained away and they both knew I was specifically speaking about my mother's funeral, but there had been others.  Fellow hunters who had died in the area and I went to show their families support.  It was the least I could do when I was sent to clean up their mess.

We parked in lower parking garage and I hated it worse than most places in the AU building.  It reminded me of clinging in fear to the man who had started my nightmares.  It was not a happy place.

Jace and his family headed for the elevator as I hefted my bags on my shoulder.  They stood waiting for the elevator and I couldn't make myself do it right now.  My stomach was already doing flips and I was anxious about everything happening today I didn't need more.  "I'm going to take the stairs."

Jace nodded.  "I'll take your bags to your room so you can go straight there then.  Stop by the class if you can I want them to meet you."

I nodded and handed him my bags taking the folder of notes from my backpack.  "Thanks, man.  I'll try."

The elevator dinged and I watched as my only family went in and turned around and the little ones waved good-bye.  I hated leaving them even though I intended to stay here and they'd be in my life more now.  It still hurt watching them leave.

I headed for the stairs once the elevator doors closed.  I walked them casually to the lobby.  I wasn't in a hurry.  I had a little time.

I stopped in the lobby and sat down with a black coffee in front of the statue of Atlas and tried to focus on the words I needed to remember.  This was the biggest deal I'd ever done.  In the field I didn't have to give speeches.  And these people were way smarter than I was.  Who was I kidding?

A small sound made me look up and I saw Stella standing across the table from me.  "Fancy meeting you here."

I grinned up at her.  I tried not to flirt though, but it was hard.  "I told you I work here."

She nodded.  "I know, but it's a big place."  Stella pointed at the plaque on the statue, that says you made that."

I turned around though I knew she was pointing at Atlas and the little gold placque that they mounted to the base of the statue.  I shrugged.  "When I was a kid."

When I turned around Stella was staring at me, "What are you a virtuoso?"

I shook my head. "No."  I was Cesari.  But I couldn't exactly tell her that.

"It's beautiful.  Did you have help?"  She asked.

"No. It was an art project."

"You had to have help.  There is no way a kid could have made that.  It's so detailed."

I shrugged.  "You might understand later."

"What's that supposed to mean?"  She sounded offended.

I stood up and looked at the time on my phone.  I'd wasted too much time.  I held my hand out to invite Stella along as I headed for the elevator with my coffee and notes.  "If you are here for a job I think you are, then you'll come to understand."

"You know something about what I'm interviewing for?"

"Not specifically no.  I have a gut feeling and I trust my gut."  I grinned at her as I stood staring at her instead of the elevator door.  

The door dinged open and I waited for people to file out before stepping inside the plate glass death trap with Stella.  I caught a glimpse of her looking at me as I clamped my eyes shut.  Stella moved closer and took my hand in hers.  "I can see why you are afraid of elevators now."

"I've always been afraid of heights.  But this makes it worse."  I intoned in a soft whisper.  

We rose up in side the elevator and I could feel my fluttering increase.  We both got out at the top floor.  It was the main offices of the Infirmary and Venatori Headquaraters.  Stella smiled at me.  "I guess this is it.  Wish me luck."

"Good luck Stella.  You'll do great."  I kissed her cheek.

I could feel the anxiety rising as the conference area on the next floor up neared closer.  I took the elevator that was slightly more offset from the first one, it was behind a key carded turn stile but in reality it was a supernatural gate.  Technology and magic combined to freely let the supernatural pass through, humans required a key card.

I so wasn't ready for this.
