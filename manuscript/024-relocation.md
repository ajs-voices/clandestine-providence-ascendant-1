## Relocation

I woke feeling slightly more rested but there was pain still everywhere.  I woke to Dorian's shallow breathing of sleep.  His arm still draped over my body.  I shifted uncomfortablly and he stirred.  He smiled down at me, "Hey."

"Hey yourself."  I said sleepily.

The table had been moved to the side I was sleeping on and I picked up a peice of bread.  There also looked to be more food than I remembered on it.  With a note.  I tried to sit up but that failed in a massive shootin pain everywhere in my body.  "Don't move Nox. Or they will have to strap you down again."

I nodded.  "There is a note."

Dorian sat up and reached for the folded peice of paper and handed it to me as he leaned back down and laid next to me.  I opened it.  "You need to stop doing this.  I'm getting tired of cooking for you.  Love you.  Get better.  - Mia"

I grinned and set the card down.  "I'm sure I will hear all about how she walked in on us later."

Dorian smiled lazily at me.  "If she's friends with you I'm sure you will."

"She's family."  I said absently.  I picked up the bowl closest to me and popped open the lid and started eating.  My stomach rumbled the second it smelled whatever delicious concontion lie in the plastic container.  

Dorian got up and I watched him stretch out the kinks, sleeping that way couldn't have been comfortable.  He smiled at me as I watched him.  He didn't come back to sit with me he busied himself with other things in the room.  Packing bags and looking for something.  He dropped a pair of shorts and a clean shirt on the bed.  "They will be moving you today I'm sure you'd like to be in something a little more suitable than a hospital gown."

I laughed.  "What you don't want all the pretty nurses and orderlys checkout out my ass?"

Dorian chortled.  "Whatever you want love."

I smiled happily.  "Love?"

He looked at me with a steady gaze before he answered.  "You started it."

I nodded.  "I did.  I..."

Dorian took a few steps and put his finger against my lips.  "I already know.  I am not sure why, or how this happened after one day, but I feel the same.  I would watch you from the other side of this room.  The window was always open and the door always closed.  You'd thrash with whatever nightmares you were having in your coma.  But the moment I opened the door you'd settle down into a quiet slumber.  It was like you knew I was there.  Nurse Morgenstern said it only happened with me.  I had asked even when Mr. Hill visited and she said, he'd come in lie down with you never working about whether or not you'd hurt him, but you never stopped twitching even though he was lying next to you."

"Jace hever made me feel safe.  He made me feel loved, but the nightmares were still there.  Always there.  Jace is used to my nightmares, he'd sleep with me like that when we were kids.  He'd push me out of bed some days because I was worse than other nights."

"Have you ever had a good nights rest?"  Dorian asked softly.

I shook my head.  "Not since I can remember.  There may have been a night or two but they are hardly worth remembering."

Dorian frowned.  "They will have to strap you down again while you heal."

I nodded.  "Probably.  Though if you try again, it might take the pain away."

Dorian smiled.  "I can try.  With your conscious instruction I might get more done."  He didn't hesitate he stepped closer to me and put his hands above me.  "First thing is to get all the elements flowing.  The threads were thin, the pattern you showed me was simple enough."

Dorian started with air.  "Start with water," I suggested.  Dorian nodded and started creating water, then air, fire and earth.  He rotated through all four elements.  I grinned at him.  He moved faster through each pattern before he touched my chest with one hand and my stomach with the other.  

I couldn't see the weaves but my back arched and I could feel the crawling of every cell in my body.  I wanted to scream but the pain was so bad I couldn't even open my mouth.  I don't know how long Dorian stood there feeding me his energy but he took a step back and almost stumbled.  He was smiling at me.  "I need to eat now."

I did my best to nod in the direction of the food.  He took a peice of bread and started nibbling at him.  "Did it help?"

I held up one finger from the hand on the bed that he could see.  He nodded.  and ate fully.  He looked ravenous.  

I managed to move and it didn't send shooting pains through my body.  "Yeah.  It helped I think.  But it hurt."

Dorian frowned.  "Did I do soemthing wrong?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I assume it's suppose to hurt when your body is doing double duty healing."

"It didn't hurt when you did it to me"

"I think it's the nature of the injury.  The worse it is the more painful it is.  It's hurt when I've done it to myself.  It could just be my reaction." I tried to reassure Dorian.  "I feel beter.  Honest.  Moving isn't kiling me."

The door to my room opened and a brunette with a purple streak stepped inside.  "I see you are both awake now.  Mr. Vega can I speak with him alone."  Her voice was familiar as was her face but I couldn't quite place her.

I shook my head.  "He's not going anywhere unless it's an emergency."

She frowned at me and I remembered her face then.  "If that's how you want to play it."

I smiled at her.  "He'll just watch from the camera on the other side anyway so what's the point Madison."

"You remembered my name.  I'm suprised."  she sounded incredulous - she didn't beleive that I'd remember her.  Remember the first person I ever had sex with.

"I can hardly forget you.  Even in the pain induced haze I'm in now.  One doesnt' forget their first, Madison."

She rolled her eyes.  "Can we put that behind us where it belongs.  We are adults now."

Dorian chuckled.  "You might be but I have my doubts about him."

She grinned and nodded her head towards Dorian.  "I like him."

I smiled. "Me too."

A deep blush rose in Madison's face.  "Sorry didn't mean to..."

"It's alright.  What do you need Nurse Pratt?" I asked.

"We are moving you today.  And I will be your nurse in the ward.  Now that you are awake, we need you to voluntairly submit yourself.  It will look better if you do it instead of court issued."

"I'm not admitting I'm sucidal to anyone.  I didn't try to kill myself."

Madison sighed.  "Okay.  But you won't be able to leave and you'll be under strict supervision if the court refers you to us.  Meaning no visitors, no contact with other residents."

I looked at Dorian and I couldn't imagine not having him there at least for a few minutes.  "Fine I'll sign the paperwork." I asked, "Why didn't you just get my father to sign it."

"We did try.  He wouldn't sign it.  Dr. Silverman wouldn't sign it.  Even Ms. Rivera wouldn't sign it.  You had no legal guardian.  Mr. Vega was never asked because as far as all records are concerned both of you are single."  

"We've been on one date.  And that wasn't exactly a date either."

Madison laughed, "You don't act like you've only just met.  The way you calmed down with him around, Nox.  The concern Mr. Vega shares for you.  You act like a couple hwo's been together for years."

I realized that there was a lot more to our relationship than I had originall thought.  I wasn't the only one who'd fallen fast.  I smild at Dorian then back at Madison, "We are just that perfect."

Dorian laughed and Madison rolled her eyes.  "I'll bring the paperwork in and you can sign it.  Mr. Vega, if you'd like to help him get dressed since moving is a bit rough right now for him.  I'd appreciate it.  We'd like to show him to his new room."

I sighed as Madison left.  So much for spending more time with Dorian alone even if it was in a hospital room.  The door shut and Dorian closed the blinds on the windows.  I grinned at him as he walked my direction.  "What you don't want them seeing what I'm sure they've already seen?"

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  That's not it."

Dorian sat me up and untied the knot at the back of my neck holding the gown closed.  His hands grazed my skin sending shockwaves through my body.  My attention was completely on Dorian as he helped me sit with my legs over the edge of the bed.  My body was starting to ache which was good and bad - partly because most of it was real pain and the other part was my lust for Dorian's touch.  

I sat naked on the bed once the gown had been completely removed the sheet was covering the more intimate parts of my body, Dorian had left it descretely in place as he pulled the gown from my arms.  He was protecting my modesty - as if I had some.

He knelt down and I watched him help me slide boxers over my feet.  I had to steand up, my knees felt like jelly as I stood there incapable of doing anything else.  Thsi was going to suck if this remained the same for more than the day.  

I sat back down and Dorian's fingers lingered on my hips before he started with the shorts.  He helped me stand up again and pulled them to my hips.  He was careful  with me.  Every touch carefully placed but still eliciting the same sparks through my body.  My heart was racing in my chest.  My mouth was dry and everything pointed towards a panic attack but I knew that wasn't it, there was no fear.

Dorian helped me sit back down before he started with my t-shirt.  Lifting my arms above my head hurt worse than standing up.  I tried not to show the pain but Dorian moved faster than he had before when he looked into my eyes as he pulled the shirt down over my head.  I leaned forward and felt the pain in my back muscle spring to life, but I kissed Dorian anyway.  I wanted to feel his lips against mine.  He stepped closer alleviating some of the strain, his hands running along my sides as his lips parted mine and the kiss pushed us both into a breathless moment.  He pulled away slowly and looked into my eyes.  I could see the heat in them.  I smiled.  "Thank you."

Dorian nodded still catching his breath.  "Anytime."

I laughed.  "I'd rather next time you take them off instead of put them on."

A small blush rose in Dorian.  "Maybe next time."

"Only when you are ready."  I lifted my hand to his cheek.  "I'll wait forever for you if I need to."

Dorian smiled.  "You don't need to wait, Nox."  He leaned in and kissed me softly.  "I'm waiting on you."

On me?  I didn't get a chance to ask him before the door opened.  "You ready to move Nox.  Mr. Vega..."

I interrupted.  "Dorian.  You make him sound old, he's your age."

Madision nodded.  "Dorian is welcome to join us while we settle you in.  But he will have to follow policy and only join you during visiting hours from here on out.  If you could sign here."

I sighed and signed the dotted line - willingly submitting myself to the pschye ward for sucide watch.  It was the only way I was going to be able to see anyone other than my nurses and doctors and I truly didn't want to miss out on Dorian.
