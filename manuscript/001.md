# Part I: The Dawning

## Fear of Flying

The flight out of Denver International Airport was early, though Nox had been up for hours already by the time he arrived at the airport to check in.  He always was with the nightmares that plagued his nights.  Nox twirled the string on his gray hoodie with absent abandon as he waited patiently in line behind a man wearing a long brown trenchcoat and a wide brimmed hat.  

The man in front of him danced from foot to foot with a heavy sigh escaping his lungs.  Nox could see the stereotypical terrorist standing in front of him with his tanned skin and dark facial hair.  But he removed his coat and hat with the rest of them when he drew near the conveyor belt.

His voice was accented as you'd expect of a man of his heritage, "You shouldn't travel alone, Miss."  He stepped around the woman in front of him and the only thought that passed through Nox's mind was _how rude!_.  But it gave Nox full view of the short red-head totting a toddler who was half her size on her hip.  She was trying to untie the boy's shoe and the child was not cooperating in the least.  

The little toddler squirmed around and she dropped everything she'd been holding to keep him undercontrol.
