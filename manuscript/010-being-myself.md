## Being Myself

I took a deep breath and walked out on to the stage and stood behind the podium and then looked out over the crowd.  I saw Dae'lin standing near the closed double doors in the back and Dorian was walking down the aisle to th empty seat in the front row that said 'Reserved - Dorian Vega'.  His own personal front row seat.  I could see his small smile and a nod of his head as I watched him.  He was pushing me onward and upward.

I waited for him to sit down in his seat and I could feel a wave of grumbling start from the audience.  I closed my eyes and then opened the with a deep breath and started.  "This is all new to me - forgive my nervousness."  I picked up the first note on the podium in front of me and glanced down at it.  And I remembered Dorian's words - be yourself.  This wasn't me.  I set the paper down and stepped out from behind the podium.  One man stood up and spoke loudly.  "I knew this was going to be a waste of time."

I stepped forward and amplified my voice with a pattern of air.  "You are free to leave, but I assure you it's not a waste of your time.  Or I wouldn't be here."

I took another step forward and set off a light show of patterns that did nothing really, a soft rain cloud formed along the ceiling, lighting arced from beam to beam, a soft summer breeze rustled the papers in the audience.  I couldn't think of anything to do with earth that wouldn't make a mess so I didn't bother with a visible element.  "How many of you can see the patterns that make up all of these magnus made phenomenon."

A few hands rose up in the air - Dorian's included.

I grinned down at him.  "What if I told you I could teach you to bend those elements?"

The man who had gotten up to leave was standing in the aisle staring around at the phenomenon around him and he slowly rose his hand.  Then he spoke.  "I'd call you a liar."  But he moved back towards his seat.

"I would grant you that leaway.  But I can teach you to touch the elements you beleive you can't.  It's harder in individuals who have been taught already.  But in my neice and nephew I have done so with ease.  Their little minds are eager to absorb the patterns, your's and mine have been hardwired one way.  I just never did it the correct way from the beginning.  Atlas is prof of that."

There were a few nodding heads as people remembered I had created the peice in the lobby.  "Is anyone is willing to come up here with me and let me try to prove my theory in front of you?"

I pointed to the man who had gotten up to leave.  "How about you?  You are sceptical already that will make this all that much harder."

He shook his head.  "Come on." I urged him.  "Can we give him a round of applause to spur that desire to prove me wrong?"

Applause rose in the audience and the man sighed and stood up for the second time and started down the aisle this time.  I met him at the bottom of the stairs and whispered to him as I offered him my hand.  "I won't embarrass you.  I promise.  Nox.  What can I call you?"

He took my hand.  "Ben."

I smiled.  "Alright Ben.  Thank you for coming up on stage."

He mumbled.  "This better be worth it."

I smiled at him and ran my fingers through the wayward strands.  "Ben has kindly agreed to be our proof that I can teach him to touch any element he can see."

"Now Ben.  I'm going to tell you what I think your designation is right now. Have you told me, or do we know each other?"

He shook his head. "I didn't tell you nor do I know you more than a file on the computer."

"I'm sure that was quite the read."  I smiled at him and took a deeper look into his is aura of patterns.  They oscilated at differing frequencies depending on their strength and how many elements they could touch.  I can't see mine so I have no idea what it looks like, but I could clearly see Ben's.  "You are NAA3".

His jaw dropped and he mouthed, "How did you do that?"  He nodded his head in agreement.

I answered the question he had asked because I knew it was the same question on everyone elses mind.  "Every person resonated at a different frequency and the patterns and frequency determine what you are."

I drew in the air with a flaming pen, it left trails of color and sparks as I drew a diagram of the different types of oscilations and what they meant.  

"If you look carefully at everything in this plane you will see these patterns around every living objects and similar around inanimante ones."

"But that's a bit harder to teach in the time alloted.  I'll gladly sit down with you on a one and one basis if you really want to learn."

Ben nodded.  "I'd like to."

"We'll get that scheduled up afterwards.  Are you ready to touch fire?" I asked.

He nodded empathically.  They were starting to beleive me.

I smiled at Dorian in the front row and sat down in front of him on the stage and patted the area next to me for Ben.  I asked, "Can everyone in the back see alright?"

A chorus of yes sounded from the back and I went on.  "Ben you see the glowing red orb in front of me?"

He nodded as I formed it slowly and made sure everyone could see what I was doing.  At least every Magnus or Magnus indeterminate  I suspected there were alot of them out there today in the Scrin.

"Ben.  Think of the color red in your head.  Draw a mental line to the fire ball."  This will connect you to the element.  "Put everything else out of your head."

He tried and he failed.  "Try again.  Clear your mind.  Ignore everything else but the color red.  Don't worry about the people around you, or the next phone call you have to make when this day is over or on our next break."

I watched as the patterns changed around him and fire channeled into his body.  No one else saw it, they weren't watching as closely as I was.  I smiled at him.  "Try this."

I wove the simplest pattern available - a single simple flame.  I wove slow and precise so Ben could follow.  Above his palm sprang a weak but a single flame identical to mine.

The audience applauded as if we'd done something more than a simple trick that any child fire magnus could preform.

I stood up and clapped my hands together in applause.  "Let's give our new fire Magnus a a round of applause."  The crowd added to my applause and Ben hopped off the stage and headed to his seat.  "Thank you Ben."

"That simple trick can link you to the power of the element.  A child can do it because they don't know the hard parts about bending elements yet.  My nephew has been randomly veiling things.  Today I showed him how to do it and he picked it right now.  The younger the mind, the faster the learning.  But it doesn't mean people older than Mark Green our illustrious leader can't learn to bend all four elements if they can see them."

"I assure you that even an Erudite Magnus can pick up all four elements.  It will probably be much harder, but the capability of seeing all the elements is there for everyone.  You just need to retrain your eyes to see them."

I closed with my contact information. I gave them my email address and Dae'lin's as well just in case.  "If you are interested in anything we've talked about today email me or Dae'lin and we'll schedule a time in the next few weeks to go over those topics on a one and one basis."

I walked off the stage happier than I had been when I had started and I didn't make a fool of myself.
