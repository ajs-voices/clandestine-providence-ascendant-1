# Fear of Flying

My flight out of Denver International Airport was early but not too early at least not for me.  By the time most people's alarm clocks were going off I was already up, had a quick work out and was showered.  I had a light breakfast - completely not my usual thing consisting of cereal and milk - a sugared cereal at that.  It was all the free Continental breakfast had at this early hour that I would eat.  There was plenty of food just nothing I was overly fond of.  Things like pastries and donuts or other sugary type foods.  

But this morning was already stressful might as well add a bad breakfast to it as well.  I was thankful that my trip through security wasn't too bad well unless of course you count rude men and crying babies.  Security had a long line.  In front of me was a man wearing a fedora and a long trench-coat.  He looked like the kinda guy who you'd worry about having a bomb underneath that jacket.  But he shed it like the rest of us, hat and all and waited for his turn to place his things on the conveyor belt.

In front of him was a small redhead toting around a toddler.  The toddler wasn't happy with situation and started screaming when the woman tried to take off his shoes.  Instead of offering to help or politely waiting the man in front of me went around her - butt in front of her with a side remark.  "You shouldn't travel alone miss."

The look the small redhead gave him mimicked my thoughts exactly _How rude!_ but I didn't say anything either.  I stood behind her and watched as she struggled with the little man and he refused to be put down and she couldn't hold him.  I asked, "Do you need some help?"

The woman shook her head.  "I got this."

I couldn't help but chuckle at the irony because she clearly did not have this.  "Are you sure?"

She nodded.  "Yeah."  But she didn't sound very convincing.

I gently moved her hands from the tiny shoe and carefully untied the knotted laces that were giving a one handed momma a hard time.  The shoe slipped off quickly and she looked relieved.  "Thanks, I guess," she said to me as she placed all of her things on the belt and stepped through the medal detectors without being further assaulted.  

I didn't have the same luck.  I was randomly chosen to be searched a little more throughly, I hadn't even stepped through the metal detector when the man pulled me aside and started waving the wand over my long arms.  He was a short stocky man build like a truck.  But when the wand neared my junk I had to comment despite the beat down I was likely to get.  "Don't ya think you should be me a drink first?"

The man gave me this look that was a cross between pissed off and completely taken back.  I grinned at him.  "Sorry, man, had to lighten the mood."

The security officer rolled his eyes and went back to work.  As a parting gift he used the small want to swat my backside.  I turned around with a laugh, "Next you buy me drinks first!"

He let out a loud guffaw and went back to work.  At least some people can take a joke I wasn't always so lucky.  I'd been beat down on a regular basis because of my sexual preferences.  I'm not saying I don't like women because I do - a lot.  I just also happen to like men.  And bigotry and homophobic tendencies run high in the land of the free.  Everyone seems entitled to their right way - sure the land of the free is free but only if you are exactly like us.  Dicks!  

I knew my train of thought was only going to make shit worse when I actually got on the plane so I found a stall that sold water and I bought two bottles and a cheap magazine to read while I waited in the terminal to distract my mind.  But I can't stop being me even when I know it causes people to stair at me.  The magazine was a teeny-bopper glam magazine meant for teenage girls.  I was far from teenage and short of the eyeliner I applied everyday I wasn't really into make up.

The terminal was empty except for a one other passenger, and elderly lady with an oxygen tank sitting next to her seat.  I sat two seats away from her.  I was a social butterfly.  Jace asked me more than once, "Do you ever not talk to people?"

I could only shrug at my best friends question.  I was looking for something in someone.  I don't know what.  But I wanted people to make up their mind about me out of the gate so I could move on.  People were dicks in most cases.  They refused to talk to you or they ignored you.  Even when I didn't hit on them, they were still dicks.

I dropped the magazine in the chair between us and the woman looked down and then back up at me and I grinned at her.  "You can read it.  I'm sure a lovely young lady like yourself doesn't need any tips, but hey it can't hurt either, can it?"

The woman smiled at me and for a woman her age I was certain those were her real choppers.  I grinned at her, "Great smile."

The elderly woman turned a pretty shade of rose and waved her hand in front of her.  Bingo!  Job well done.  I added, "I'm sure all the gentleman at home notice too."

The blush deepened just as a woman sat across from us.   From the way she'd plopped down in the seat she had a rough time of something.  I beamed my best smile at her and continued with the charade, "This must be your sister."  It was likely she was her daughter or grand-daughter judging by her age, but if I were take a guess she was a spitting image of the older woman.

The elderly woman's blush was all but gone at the compliment, "Oh dear no.  This is my grand-daughter, Erin."  

"A pleasure.  Nox."  I turned back towards the elderly woman and offered her my hand, "And what may I call you other than sweet-thing?"

I gained another slight blush as the woman too my hand in hers.  "It's Erin too." 

"A pleasure, Erin."  I raised her hand to my lips and could smell the tale-tell signs of a hospital on her - she was clearly from a nursing home or a stint in the actual hospital.  I kissed the top of her middle knuckle and she pulled her hand from my light grip.

"You indulge an old lady.  You shouldn't waste your flattery on me.  My grand-daughter would be far better suited for it."  She chided.

I laughed, "Duckling, she probably hears all that all the time.  You on the other hand are a doll and I'm sure no one tells you enough."  I patted the magazine on the chair between us - tapping at the biggest article on the cover "How to be better in bed".  She glanced down at my tapping and blushed.  "I wasn't lying when I told you you probably didn't need any advice on the topic.  I'm sure you are a wild cat."

She lowered her head and I could see the rose color rising to her ears.  The younger version of her self picked up the magazine and tossed it at me.  "Leave my grandmother alone you pervert!"

Score number 2 I managed to piss off the young one.  "Pervert?  That's all you got?"

The younger Erin rolled her eyes at me and helped her grandmother stand.  "Nana, let's move over here so you can rest in peace."

I called out after them, "Ms. Erin, don't let them put you in the grave before you are ready.  We are only as old as we think we are."  I added as a second thought, "And nice ass."

I could hear the younger woman grumbling as she walked away from me with her grandmother in tow.  I listened to their conversation for a short while before I notice a small hand wiggling it's way towards the magazine.  A boy of about 3 years old was sneaking the magazine from my lap.  I looked around for his mother and found her busy trying to situated the stroller, a car seat and several small bags into a means to carrying them all and her son. 

I handed the boy the magazine and picked him up in my lap.  He turned and sat down with the magazine in his lap and flipped to the first page.  I started reading, figured that's what he wanted.  It was the Table of Contents but hey, the kid didn't care.  The moment I read the "How to be better in bed" title the redhead looked up, snatched her son from my lap and glared at me.  Her little voice squeaked before she was actually able to make any words come out of her mouth, "How dare you?  First you assault that old woman and now you assault my son - again!"

I shrugged.  "If that's how you want to see it fine by me.  But you should pay more attention to your son, he was over hear trying to take it from me."

She turned a color almost as read as her hair.  "I'm so sorry.  That was uncalled for."

"No harm no foul."  I stood up so I wasn't looking up at her, not something I enjoyed, being 6'0" I was usually the one being looked up to.  "Name is Nox.  Let me help you.  Reorganize your gear, or hold your son while you do it.  I'm getting on this plane and I'm not going anywhere until it leaves.  I give you my word."  I held up two fingers in scout's honor.  

She laughed, which was better than yelling at me.   I handed her my ticket.  "You hold this to prove I'm not going anywhere."

She looked down at it and then at her ticket in her pocket and sighed. "It seems I won't be getting away from you any this morning."  She held up her ticket and the seat was right next to mine.  

I smiled.  "I'll behave.  Promise."

I took the little boy from her hands and sat back down on my seat with the magazine in our laps and we pointed out pictures.  He was pretty good at finding even tiny little letters in the print.  A smart kid.

She started fixing her things again and then looked up at me and her son with what I could only explain as fear I had left with her son.  I smiled at her to reassure her but I doubted that would work.  She spoke to me a few moments after going back to her work.  "Stella, and that's Aidan."

I nodded.  "A pleasure.  I'd offer you my hand but it seems both of them are rather occupied."  Aidan had taken to moving my hands to open and close the magazine and he was giggling softly to himself.

Stella giggled herself and sat down across from us and watched her son play.  I spent the greater part of my wait tending to the squirming child in my lap.  I missed Jace's kids.  I was glad that he was picking me up when I landed.  It would be good to see JJ and Naya.

A woman, who was clearly a stewardess, came over to us and looked at me.  "Would you like to board first?"

I looked up and was surprised to see Cindy - a regular flight attendant on other trips out of town just not usually to New York.  She frowned and then smiled.  "I didn't know you had a son."

I laughed.  "I don't.  This is her son.  I don't want to sit on that death trap any longer than I already have to." I looked across the floor to Stella, "Do you want to get on first?  I'm pretty sure she meant to ask you."

Stella looked up at her.  "No, we'll board when he does, he's rather helpful."

I laughed. The stewardess smiled sweetly at me.  "Alright, sweetie.  I'll see you on board."  She winked at me. 

Stella was staring at me.  "Friend of yours?" she asked.

I shrugged.  "A girl I slept with."

"So you really are that playboy? You weren't just being nice to an older woman."  She sounded like that was a bad thing.

"At least you know what you get."  I said with my inflated ego voice.

Stella rolled her eyes at me as the intercom called the first rows.  "Why didn't you want to get on early?  It'd have been easier."

"Afraid of flying.  I'm putting it off as long as I can. So my anxiety doesn't spike prematurely."

Stella laughed, "Does that happen often?"

Oh I liked her.  I grinned at her.  "No.  I make sure they are satisfied before hand."

The rose color of her embarrassment rushed to her face and she took Aidan from my hands and sniffed his bottom then wrinkled her nose.  I laughed.  "That's sexy."

And I was rewarded with a deepening red as she sat her son in her lap trying to look all casual like.  But she didn't try to speak.

I winked at her.  "Come on, let's get on the plane so you can change him."

Standing up I grabbed her things and mine but Stella hesitated.  "But.."

"I'll be fine."  I offered her a hand up with a grin.  She took it carefully adjusting her son to her hip.  Her hand was warm and I could smell the sweet scent of roses as she drew near.  Aidan didn't smell like he needed to be changed to me, but then again I wasn't focusing on that.  It must be a mother thing.  

Stella had our three tickets in her hands and I had everything else except Aidan and we stood impatiently in line to get on the stupid, flying, death trap they called an airplane.  I really hated airplanes.  No I was afraid of flying, it wasn't the airplanes fault, or the pilots.  It was my mother's fault.

I had just turned five when I was on my first flight.  It probably wouldn't have been so bad if it were not for the fact that only hours before my mother was spiting at me and calling me a monster.  And hours before that I had sparked.  I watched as a time flicker of flame caught fire on the curtains.  I remember it clear as day.

I remember that tiny little pattern coalesce and form and take light with only my thoughts to guide it.  I know it was me.  I knew then it was me.  My mother knew it was me too.  

I took a deep breath and swallowed the memory into the depths of my mind again.  I disliked thinking about her - about my mother - the woman who gave me away without a second thought.  I hated her.  I could hear Margo's words screaming back at me now.  _"You don't hate her.  You are angry.  You have every right to be but hate is a very strong word."_  It was something she said to me often when the topic of my mother came up.

There was a warm hand with rose scent wafting up from my arm that brought me back to my senses.  Stella asked, "You okay?  We are almost there."

I nodded my head.  I didn't trust my words as I shifted our things to the other side so I could get my ID out of my wallet in my back pocket.  It was a Colorado issued drivers license however I had never taken a driving test so to speak at least not in Colorado.  I had in New York City where I grew up but that was a long time ago.

The picture was a poor representation of myself but it at least looked like me.  Jace's never had, but then again he had a black eye the day he took the picture.

It wasn't the stewardess at the counter that I knew who took our tickets.  She didn't think twice about the fact that we weren't actually together.  Two separate parties but our seats were together and we looked like a happy little family, but we were complete strangers.

We walked down the narrow cat walk that connected the terminal to the airplane and I could feel my heart starting to race.  I could feel the sweat starting to form at the base of my neck.  Stella was in front of me and for that I was grateful.  She turned around to make sure I was still following and she frowned.  "You really don't like to fly do you?"

I shook my head.  "No, but I'll be fine."

Several other passengers behind us rushed passed us as we stood in the catwalk.  I drapped my arm around the tiny redhead and rubbed the little boy's shoulder and hurried us along the rest of the way.  There was no better way to do this than to just get it done.  Stella commented, "Like a band-aid."

I laughed softly, "Did I say that out loud?"

She patted my hand, "Yep."

I apologized, "Sorry.  I'll try not to let that happen again."

Stella squeezed my hand and we entered the plane single file with her things trailing behind me as I lugged everything through the narrow passage ways.  My friend greeted me at the door way and winked at me slyly.  I rolled my eyes once I was past her.  I wasn't exactly in the playing mood right now - she knew this.

Stella found our seats and stopped to set Aidan in the seat and asked, "Can I have his seat?"  

I managed to get it undone from the set up Stella had manuevered and  handed it her without knocking anyone in the head.  There were people waiting behind us to get past and I turned and apologized to them  but the were rude anyway.  I didn't hurry on principle then.

Stella got Aidan in the seat by the window strapped into his car seat and the airplane seat and she was trying to get inside the row so I could put things away.  The man behind me tried to push me and I turned and grinned at him.  "Sorry.  Women and children first."

He gave me a nasty glare.  I laughed and picked up the stroller and started to put it away in the overhead bin with the rest of our things.  I grabbed the magazine I'd bought and my earbuds from my things and sat down slowly next to Stella as she fussed with her son.  He was not happy to be strapped in from the sounds of things.

We sat on the plane and I could hear my pulse in my ears.  I knew that my palms were sweaty as I gripped the arm of the chair.  Stella patted my hand, "It'll be alright."

"It always is."  I said flatly.  "Give Aidan the magazine.  It should keep him quiet."

"He'll just eat it."  Stella said.

"No.  Trust me."

"I know my son."  I could hear the anger in her voice.

I shrugged.  "Fine."  I pulled my hand from under hears and put it in my lap and squeezed my knees instead.  I could feel the strength of my own grip and was thankful I didn't have the strength of the Venatori or I'd have bruises.

The flight attendants started their spiel and I couldn't pay attention to the words.  I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing.  This was worse than the elevators in the AU building back home.  It was a long drawn out process one I had to endure for hours.  I don't think I could actually make a flight over seas.

Stella fussed with her son over sitting still and squawking.  The plane started moving and we
