## Fire and Bombs

I didn't get far before the blaring of the firealarm startled me and sent a sharp spike through my body.  It was a gut reaction but I was already walking towards the siren.  Not away like everyone else.  Most people abandoned the building when the fire alarm went off.  But each alarm in the AU building was unique.  There was a normal fire alarm that belched out four short burst then a small pause before repeating itself.  It said there was a fire and it needed you to evacuate immediately.

But this wasn't that type of alarm.  When you run an academy for young magnus there was always the off chance that one of them could spark accidentally.  The five bursts were unique to a firestarter started fires and the bursts directly following it indicated the floor, then a small pause told you which wing and area it was in.  The building was laid out in a grid.  To the uneducated it sounds like a normal fire alarm so humans were left to evacuate - only those who lived here really understood the subtle differences.

I found myself in the common area, but I wasn't the first hunter on the scene.  I frowned the moment I saw the back of an older man with peppered brown hair, that used to be the color of my own - my father.  He was speaking to an older version of Dorian.  I had forgotten that his father was my father's partner.  They had worked together since the Academy and if I were to trust the information around they were best friends.

I was about to leave when I let my senses drift and saw floating patterns around the scene that were not connected.  It was like leaves fluttering in the wind.  A man walked through one and it disappaited.  I yelled.  "Hold."

Everyone in the vicinity froze and turned in place to look at me, my father included.  The man who had just walked through one stood next to me and looked curiously at me.  "What?"

"There are stray patterns floating around.  The remenants of the pattern used here."

I looked around and saw all the hurt people.  "If you want to preserve them quickly I  need someone who can remember every detail quickly."  

My father's best friend reached into his pockect as he spoke.  "I know someone."  He started dialing while my father glared at me.  But he said nothing.  Everything was in limbo until we could do something about it.

I started directing people around me to clear the scene.  I gave them directions and they followed them to the letter.  It was a little like the childhood game simon says.  I managed to clear most of the unneed people and cleared the medics to do their jobs in a more convinent place.  They hadn't wanted to move the worst victim - who I sadly knew.  He was my half brother.  He looked up at me in pain, the burns covered half of his body and most of his face.  

I hadn't done this in a while but I fed my half brother all four elements.  I poured them into his wounds and the medics at his side jaw dropped.  They turned to look at me and asked, "What are you doing?"

"Healing, Nick. So shut up and let me work."  It took a lot out of me to do this for such extensive injuries.  I had only healed one such injury to myself before.  It wasn't my first burn, but it was the only one that I didn't have any evidence of its presence.  I was thankful.  I could hear Nick's breathing getting better and the pain in his eyes lessened until he was smiling up at me trying to sit up.

I put my hand on his once scorched chest to keep him lying down.  "Not yet."

The medics didn't do anything as they watched his wounds knit together.  But then they started questioning me.  "How are you doing this?"

There was a tap on my shoulder and I turned to find Dorian standing behind me with a grim frown.  "You needed a photographic memory?"

I nodded.  I pulled the gurney Nick was on and manuevered it through the maze of patterns that were still floating in the air.  "Yeah."  I left the medics to tend to Nick for the rest of his injuries.  He'd live and heal perfectly but I hadn't finished, and now I was feeling a little faint.  Not eating breakfast was paying a toll on me now.  "Can you memorize what the patterns look like and draw them?"

Dorian shook his head.  "The patterns are too intracate.  There is no way I can remember that.  Some are weaker than others."

I nodded.  "Alright, take pictures of the scene.  Memorize where the patterns are floating but don't disturb them."

Kai stood where he had been when I first saw him.  Emilio was already discussing something in a safe area.  I walked over to him and said, "We can deal with this later."

Kai just nodded and followed the same path is father had.  He hadn't said anything to me.  Nothing.  I was surprised.  I wasn't sure what was going on.

I waved my hand, it was a flourishing gesture I used when I was showing off.  I hadn't done it in years but it had been a trick I used when I was around all these people.  In my hand I created a peice of charcol and colored it red first and started drawing on the nearest wall the fire patterns, and blue for water, yellow for air and brown for earth.  Dorian was on my heels.  He was watching what I drew and making mental note of where they were in relation to things.  I hoped his memory was that good.

We worked systematically drawing the patterns and then wiping them from their measely existance until we had completed the job.  Dorian leaned against the wall with a smile.  "Now I guess we have more to talk about over dinner."

I grinned at him.  "I guess we do."

The man who had destroyed the first pattern walked up to us.  "Sorry to interrupt, but is it clear.  We'd like to get this place straightened out."  And he nodded his head in the direction of a group of people who were not so patiently waiting for me.  I had done the unthinkable - I healed someone.  A feat unknown to Magnus.  I didn't want to talk to them.

So I did the next best thing.  I grinned at Dorian and sucked the air from my lungs and passed out in oblivion.

* * *

The darkness left and I started hearing a voice that I remembered and a small smile splayed on my face.  "It's been 15 years since he last tried."  The soft voice of Margo's receptionist spoke in a hushed whisper.

"Are you sure?  He did that on purpose."  Dorian!

I opened my eyes and sat up, my head hurt.  Megan turned to look at me.  "Nox what did you do?  Mr. Vega here is certain is was more than lack of food."

I gave him a lazy grin.  "Sorry.  Yes Megan.  I did it on purpose.  It was a combination of lack of food but mostly lack of oxygen.  There was a mob of people wanting to talk to me, I didn't think I could handle more people than I had already dealt with today."

Dorian was frowning at me.  "So you fake fainting?  You don't have to suck the oxygen from your lungs like that.  I would have caught you either way."  

I couldn't help but smile at that knowledge.  "Faking fainting only works if you can keep a straight face while people fuss over you.  And I didn't think I could manage that feat with you standing there."

Megan looked at me and grinned and stepped into Margo's office to consult with her.  She had been on the phone the entire time with the medics fending them off - saying I was unavailable until cleared by her.

At least that was a good development.  I stood up but when I did I swayed and faster than I could blink and try again Dorian was at my side.  He had an apple and a bottle of water.  I grinned at him.  "Those aren't edible."  

Margo's office was littered with apple relics - and a fake apple tree in one corner and a bowl of apples sat on Megan's desk.  Dorian bit into it and there was a surprisingly wet smack to it.  I knew shock ran across my face.  For all these years I had thought they were fake.

Dorian smiled at me and handed it to me.  I looked at it and stared at it for a moment before my stomach rumbled loudly and I took the sweet smelling apple.  I didn't usualy like eating apples.  I bit into it and was surprised to find it was deliciously sweet and crunch.  Dorian spoke softly, "I brought it with me."

I grinned at him as I took another bite.  I chewed slowly watching Dorian watch me.  I swallowed carefully and said.  "I knew they were fake."

Dorian chuckled but it faded quickly and he frowned.  "Please don't do that again."

I nodded.  "Okay.  I panicked."

Dorian held a finger up to stop me from speaking I bit into the apple again to show him I understood.  I wasn't quite so showy with the rest of apple.  Dorian let me finished eating the apple before he offered me the bottle of water and a napkin.  I took both and wrapped the apple core in the napkin.  Dorian held out his hand and I laughed.  " can through it away."  

He nodded.  "I know.  I got it."

I carefully placed it in his palm avoiding touching him as I stared into his deep blue eyes.  I wanted to kiss him...

Dorian stood up and I watched him walk away as I cracked the bottle.  My eyes were drawn away from Dorian's backside when I heard the familiar clicking of Margo's high heels.  I turned and looked at her.  The scowl present on her face indicated her anger at me.  Dorian was standing just behind her waiting for her to do what she was going to do.

"Sorry, Margo." I appologized.

"What are you sorry about Nox?"  There was white hot fury in her words.

"A lot of things apparently.  I'm sorry I worried Dorian.  I'm sorry I sucked the oxygen from my lungs to fake a collapse.  I'm sorry I worried you and Megan.  I'm sorry I made you fend off the people I didn't want to deal with because I'd had enough of people for the day.  I'm sorry I healed Nick.  Well I'm not sorry about that.  I'm sorry I did it in front of everyone so now I have a horde of people wanting to talk to me about more than just my paper.  Does that cover it all?"  I looked up at her waiting on her verdict.

"Are you truly not going to do it again?"  Margo asked.

I looked behind her at Dorian and nodded my head.  "Yes.  I said I wouldn't do it again."

"Why should I beleive you?  This isn't the first time.  Just the first time you've been caught."

I looked up at Margo.  "I said I wouldn't.  And I try not to lie to the people in this room."

Margo looked back at Dorian and stared at him for several moments.  Dorian just stood there letting her, though I could see the confusion on his face.  He didn't know of the crush I had years ago.  Margo did.  She looked back at me and raised an eyebrow in question.  She didn't have to say anything I knew what she wanted to know.  She wanted to know that if I had feelings for him or if I was playing games with Dorian.  I leaned back against the couch and looked up at her in all seriousness.  "Never before."

She nodded and turned to Dorian.  "I leave him in your care.  He needs to eat.  I'd take him out of the building, I can't fend the medics off much longer."

Dorian nodded.  I wondered why Dorian would agree to being my guardian for the day.  Had he carried me here alone?  He carried me...  I swallowed hard.  I wasn't exactly ready to deal with what I felt for this man.  He looked at me, "Never before?"

I grinned up at him and wrapped my arm around his waist and pushed him forward.  "I'd like to leave now."

He took the hint and opened the door and held it form me placing his hand at my wasit as he did.  It dropped the moment I was through the door.  He lead me down the stairs he said. "I don't suppose that they'll be lurking in the stairwells."

I laughed. "If they know me they will.  But I doubt anyone knows me that well - short of Jace."

Dorian smiled.  "I knew that.  I was surpised this morning to see you entering from the elevator."

"You seem to know a lot about me, that isn't in my files."

Dorian nodded.  "The latter fact came from Dae'lin and Margo in turn when I invited you to the conference I did my research so that I could make you as comfortable as you needed to be.  I didn't know much about you when we were younger.  Short of the hair and make up and the fact that you presented ..."  Dorian was fumbling for a word.

I grinned.  "Gay?"

"Yes.  I didn't want to offend you.  I know there have been women in your past."  Dorian sounded embarrassed by the fact that he knew that.

"Well thank you.  I know a little place not too far from here, if you want to join me for lunch.  I'm starving.  We can talk about what you asked me about and the scene upstairs."  I added quickly.  "That is if you have time.  You don't have to babysit me like Margo suggested."

He smiled.  "I've got to eat too."
