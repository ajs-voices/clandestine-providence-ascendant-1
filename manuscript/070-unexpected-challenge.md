## Unexpected Challenge

The magic finished washing over everyone and I was still lying in a pool of blood and covered in brain matter.  My wounds were healing slowly as the werewolf venom still coursed through my veins.  People slowly came to form a circle around me.  Jo and Raf were kneeling beside me trying to help me up.  Isabel stood standing above me with a huge smile on her face.  Elena was leaning against her still greiving her husband, but she was smiling proudly at me.  

There was a ripple in the room as the doors to the rec room crashed open and a voice boomed.  "I challenge the leader of the CCB!"

"Fuck!" I whispered.

"Where is your leader?"

The crowd around me parted like the red sea and I stood there covered in the blood of the former leader and Mark Green stared down at me as every were and memeber of the CCB bowed at my feet.  There was a crowd behind Mark Green. I saw the council and others who knew me, who had heard of my death.  My father fell to his knees I heard many gasps as Mark frowned.  "Nox?"

"In the flesh.  You didn't think to see what was going on before challenging did you?"

Mark started to stammer.  "I can... I didn't.  I will retract it."

"I'm sorry.  By the Clandestine Providence all challenges must be met once issued."  I sighed, "I accept.  What rules would you like to issue, I offer the challenger compensation."

"I'm not some weakling because of my age.  To the death."  Mark complained.

I sighed.  "As you have it." I limped my way to the center of the room and I saw Dorian staring at me and I saw the fear in his eyes.  I gave him a small smile before turning my attention to the much older man.

I raised my hand and a bell signalled the beginning of the fight.  Mark Green took up a fighting stance and I stood there weilding nothing but the air around me.  The venom in my veins was fighting me.  I fell to a knee and there was a gasp throughout the crowd.  

I looked at Isabel and she only nodded.  Mark took my distraction as signal to attack and as he let loose a series of punches that I mechanically dropped to the floor to avoid. I wove a single thread of air then wrapped it around his neck and yanked.  The pop of his spine echoed in the room as he fell to the floor.

I lay on the ground gasping for air that was struggling to reach my lungs.  Isabel was kneeling at my side at the same instant Dorian was there.  They looked across me at each other and Isabel smiled.  "You must be Dorian Vega.  I've heard so much about you."

"You have?" Dorian asked but his eyes had gone to me as he wove all four elements at the same time.   My eyes widened in surprise and he smiled down at me, "I've been practicing."

I whispered, "I love you. Both."

Dorian looked over at Isabel with a wry smiled.  "You've made an impression."  I couldn't hear anything else they said as my body arched in pain and I fought to keep the scream from leaving my lips as my body expelled the venom through my pours leaving me weak but clean.

As my senses came back to me I heard Elena herding people away from the rec room.  "He needs to sleep.  Four fights is too much for anyone.  Challenges can come tomorrow."

Dorian sounded shocked, "Four."

Isabel smiled.  "Garrett Spencer stood before James and Nox burnt him alive but not after he begged James for help and James refused him.  Charles' changlleged Nox to the right for his pack.  It was a mechanical fight, Charles wanted a fair fight which wasn't fair until James issued weapons Nox could use.  Then Nox challenged James and it was an honorable fight.  You know the rest."

There was a distrubance beyond Elena as some people were trying to get past the ring of body guards that stood between her and me.  I sat up with the help of Dorian and Isabel and saw Anabel Dowager, my father and Margo among a few others trying to get past Elena.  "It's alright Elena, they can come close, I don't expect them to challenge me.  They might damage me but they won't challenge me."

Elena gave me a wry smile and nodded, letting the small gaggle of my Venatori friends through the ring.  Anabel was holding a small bundle in her arms and was hovering over Dorian whispereing in his ear.  He frowned then nodded.  "Anabel wants to know if you want to meet your daughter Dakota."

I looked up at her and she smiled.  "I'd love to but I'm covered in things I'd rather she not see me in."

Anabel nodded, "Later then.  Dorian never turly beleive you'd died.  He had dreams about you."

I smiled.  "Ant didn't do a very good job then."

I heard a laugh echo from the shadows at the mention of his name.  "I did perfectly well my friend.  Remember your promise."

"I will come when I'm called Ant, I gave my word I will keep my promise as long as your mother does."

"Until the day she dies."

"Until the day I die."  I echoed.

"You made a deal with the vampires?"  My father stared down at me.  I  held up my hand and Isabel helped me up despite the other men around me.  She snaked an arm around my waist and helped me stand as my wounds were still healing.

"I did.  And the Venatori will stop hunting Bernstein and his followers.  Any act against the vampires is an act against me."

My father scoffed at me, "Who do you think you are issuing me orders.  The council is my commander."

I smiled.  "My dear, dear father, by the Clandestine Providence I am the leader of the Venatori.  I outrank you and every other council member in the Venatori by right and acheivement, unless someone wishes to challenge the law or me you will listen to me."

He stood there in stunned silence his mouth open.  I gave him a level look.  "In my exile I've learned alot about the Clandestine Providence.  And I will make changes."

I raised my voice so those around the ring of guards can hear me.  "Remove the bombs from the AU building and get rid of them and any other plans against the Venatori.  Same goes for you, anymove agains the Venatori is a move against me."

The members of the CCB all nodded a head and stepped sideways around the remaining Venatori.  "I want to go home."  I looked at Isabel.  She smiled and looked to Dorian and Anabel. "Dorian, Anabel, will you join us?"

Dorian looked to Anabel and she nodded, but Dorian answered with a smiled, "Our pleasure."
