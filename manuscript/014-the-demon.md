## The Demon

I swallowed hard.  I lost all feeling in my body.  I was amazed I was still standing after my reaction.  But I stood frozen as I would have as a five year old child I had been so long ago when I'd seen the man last.  I had done everything possible in every trip and every year in the Academy to avoid this man and he was intruding on my safe moment.  My heart started to race.  I could feel my palms sweating in my clenched fists.  

He smiled that slimey smile that everyone else thought was endearing.  I knew exactly what it meant.  He had me cornered.  I had no place to go.  I was his.

He took a few steps towards me and I stepped backwards not wanting to be any closer to him than I had to be.  His steps out paced mine and he was on top of me as my back hit the wall I had been throwing fireballs at.  I could still feel a slight warm in them.  Tenticales rose up over Garrett - air.  The cameras were off, not that they would catch the patterns he weilded.  My eyes went wide in fear.  My mouth went dry and I bit back the fear that was about to come out of my mouth.  

Garrett only smiled at me.  He stood waving the air tentacles behind him.  I could feel my knees starting to shake.  I was five all over again.

Garrett spoke in that quiet voice that scared me even more than what he was about to do to me.  "Turn around, my boy."

I shook my head.  But it was all I could do to not turn around at his command.  He waved his hand and one of the tentacles lashed out against my cheek and I could feel the knitting process begin.  "I am in control Nox.  Remember that."

He moved his index finger in a circle repeating his insturctions non-verbablly.  My body moved out of fear.  The will to survived overpowered the logical reason in my head.  Garrett laughed.  "Very good."

He reached around from behind me and started to unbutton my shirt.  "We don't want to ruin this fine peice of clothing."  It wasn't the first time Garrett had undressed me for similar reasons.  I vowed to myself it would be the last.

I felt his familiar touch down the length of my spine and I wanted to cringe and cower on the floor but I didn't move.  "Ah.  The memories."

Garrett had only physically hit me a few times in the course of the year we'd been together.  Today he choose to renew his interest in my flesh anew.  He brought down his open hand against the tender scars from early this morning.  The smack of flesh on flesh made we want to yowl in pain.  It wasn't the pain of the blow but the pain of the mind.  The fear welling up inside of me.  I was terrified.  But I did nothing to stop him.  I fell to my knees to remove myself from his hands but that had been a mistake as he rained down a series of blows from the air tentacles.  I bit my lip to keep from making any sounds.  I could taste blood in my mouth as I'd bitten through my lip.  

I waited with my eyes clamped shut for more blows to follow but nothing came.  I opened my eyes and turned to see if he was there.  I tried moving so he wouldn't see me but he wasn't there.  I stood up and grabbed my shirt and pulled it on.  I didn't have it buttoned yet as I left the room and ran into Dorian again.  He must have just missed Garrett.  I looked up and down the hall and didn't see him.  Had it been a figment of my imagination.  Was Garrett haunting my waking dreams?  Fuck!  I was so confused.

Dorian ran his finger down the healing mark on my cheek.  And glanced down at my exposed chest.  He didn't say anything.  "Did I miss something?"

I started to shake my head but I thought better of it.  "Yes."  It came out barely a whisper.  Dorian turned me towards the orange doored room and I froze.  "I don't want to go back in there."  Even I could hear the fear in my voice.

Dorian took me by the hand and lead me away.  "That's alright.  Come on."  

I followed numbly wherever he was taking me.  I didn't even follow the turns and stairs we took.  But Dorian never let go of my hand, even when we passed people in the halls.  

We ended up in the adult residences.  Dorian pulled out a key and opened the door to what I assumed was his apartment.  Normally I would have noticed the decor and soft scents that welcomed me when I entered but my body was numb.  Fear was etched in my blood.  I needed to do something, but I didn't know what.  I needed to go.  

"No.  Nox you don't."  Dorian said and took my hand and sat me down in a red swiveling bar stool with a back at his kitchen bar.  "Sit."

He walked around me and frowned.  "Take your shirt off."

A smart comment was lost on my lips as I complied, the reminants of Garrett's control coursing through my veins.  I pulled the black shirt off and I could feel the fabric sticking to the healing wounds.  It should hurt I thought to myself.

Dorian touched my back tenderly and I winched under his gentle touch.  "It's healing - slowly."

I nodded.  "It always does.  Repeated trama.  Scar tissue doesn't heal as fast."

"Can you do what you did for Nicholas?"  Dorian asked.

I shook my head.  "I can't do anything right now."

Dorian turned the chair so I was facing him.  "Why not?"

I shrugged.  "I can't feel anything.  It won't be controlled."

"Okay.  Then go lie down on the bed and I'll get something to help it heal faster."  Dorian headed towards the bedroom.  When I didn't immediately follow.  "Come on Nox it's this way."  He pulled me off the bar stool and in the direction of his bedroom.  This should be something more intamate.  I was lost in my own head.  I couldn't find my way out.

"This was Garrett?"

"I didn't tell you his name."  I stopped in the hall way before reaching the bedroom door.  

Dorian looked back at me.  "I looked it up.  It's my job to know things like this."  He grabbed my hand.  "There may be no proof but I can make sure he doesn't get young impressionable minds that don't have any defense against his ability."

I followed with little resistance.  Dorian opened his door and I was surprised to find it a stark difference from the rest of his living quarters.  Where everything else was shades of gray, his bedroom was painted blue and everything else was bright and blue.  The window let in sunlight.  The rest of the house had been closed off to the sun.  I stood staring in the doorway while Dorian went to the bathroom arond the corner.  I could hear running water.  I took a step inside.  It was the first voluntary move I'd made.  I smelled more cinamon and vanilla here than anywhere else in his house.  I closed my eyes and took a slow deep breath.  

I could feel the tension leaving with each breath.  I opened my eyes and laid on my stomach across Dorian's bed and I could smell Dorian all over the covering.  I buried my face in the blue comfortor.

I felt Dorian sit down on the soft bed.  I winced when he touched my back.  "Garrett did this?"

I didn't really know.  I was doubting my sanity.  "I don't know."  It came out muffled and I had to turn my head to the side and I repeated myself.  "I don't know.  I don't know if he did it, or if he invaded my day dreams."  He's never done that before.

Dorian nodded as he tenderly cared for the lashes across my back.  Whatever he was putting on it stung and I could feel the increased crawling of my skin stiching itselft back together.  I watched the man's expression change as he applied the green looking salve to my back.  Dorian asked, "You were day dreaming?  About what?"

I could hear the hope in his voice and I looked over at him and he met my eyes.  "Honestly.  You.  I was watching you walk away and thinking about ... things".

Dorian chuckled, "Things?"

"Do you really want me to spell it out, Dorian?"  I sat up and turned towards him.  His body was as close as humanly possibly to me without being in my lap.  

Dorian felt uncomfortable or that's the impression I got from the way he swallowed.  I asked.  "Do you want to know what I was thinking about, really Dorian?"

He nodded.  I leaned in close and I could smell his perfect scent, the cinamon and vanilla were over top his scent but not.  I could get lost in it.  I whispered.  "I was thinking about how much I wanted to kiss you.  How much I wanted to see you naked.  To touch your skin and feel your body against mine."

Dorian's breathing had increased and I could feel his warm breath against my neck.  Dorian whispered.  "I need to finish your back."  His voice sounded breathless and he didn't really want to.  But I pulled back and saw the lust in his eyes.  He was fightin the temptation.  I laid down on my stomach and let Dorian finish what he had started.  His hands were delicate against my skin.  I focused on each touch.  My breath quickedn with each one.  It wasn't the intamacy I had been dreaming about since meeting him, but it was better - because it was free will and not about sex.

My back hurt less and the crawling had stopped. Dorian was wiping the excess salve from my back with a damp towel.  When he was finished I felt the bed move and Dorian's weight removed from the bed. I looked back at him and saw him unbuttoning his shirt.  I turned around and sat up and watched him remove the button up shirt.  As each button unfolded I saw the beginnings of a dark tattoo across his chest.  

He wasn't built like Jace or most other Venatori that I'd seen naked.  I hadn't really been with a scholarly type before.  He had defined muscles everywhere but they were softer.  The tattooo covered his chest and when he removed the shirt completely I saw it covered his arm from shoulder to just above his wrist.  Dorian's hand fled to his waist and I grabbed them and shook my head.  "No."  I pulled him close to me between my legs and kissed his chest.  "This is enough."  I licked and nibbled at his chest then looked up at him.  "Is that okay?"

He nodded and pushed me backwards I crawled up higher on the bed and Dorian followed.  His hot breathe against my skin.  I pulled him to my lips and felt his soft lips against mine.  He bit my lip softly and a moan escaped before I could stop it.  Dorian's mouth trailed along my chin and down to my ear and my throat.  He used the perfect amount of tongue and teeth and I was putty in his hands.  His hands were soft and gentle acrossed my body and I was in heaven touching the taunt soft skin of his back.  

Dorian sat up abruptly and took my hands that had fallen to his thighs as he sat on my hips staring down at me.  There was something primal in his eyes and it stirred things deep down inside.  Dorian drew my hands above my head starting from my sides his hand caressing my skin.  He pinned my hands there with both of his.  His body on top of me.  He kissed me deeply and I knew Dorian wanted to play rough.  My mind started to panic.  I wasn't ready for that so soon after Garrett.

Dorian pulled back slightly and I managed to stutter out.  "Yel..St..stop."

Dorian sat up and let me go.  I let my hands hang limp where he'd left them.  "I'm sorry."

Dorian got up and I followed him.  "Dorian...Stop."

He did and I pressed my body against his back wrapping my arms around his waist.  "Just not today."  

He turned around in my arms.  He looked at me but didn't say anything.  "I only have two rules." I leaned in and kissed him softly on the lips.  I pulled away enough to speak, his forehead against mine.  "No hitting."  

Dorian nodded. "And two?"

"We use safe words."  He nodded.  "Yellow means slow down, you are too close to my limits.  And Red means stop right now."

He chuckled.  "You've read Fifty Shades of Grey."

I nodded.  "Yes.  But they've been around for years before that.  It is what I was taught to use."

Dorian pulled away, "Taught?"

I sat down on the bed.  "Yes.  For when things get rough and out of my control."

Dorian sighed and walked into the bathroom.  I wanted to follow him, but I stayed where I was.  I could hear the water running and hear Dorian muttering to himself but I couldn't make out the words.  The water turned off and Dorian stepped out with a blue towel drying off his hands.  He stood in the doorway and asked softly, "Do things generally get out of your control?"

"Depends on the person.  Usually.  By the time we've started what we just did I have already stated my rules and they theirs.  A negotiation of sorts."

"All before you have sex?"

I nodded.  "Yes.  There are a lot of things you don't know about me Dorian."

"I'm beginning to see that.  So this wasn't your normal routine.  Why?"  He asked.

I looked down at my lap and bit my bottom lip.  Dorian stepped closer and knelt down at my knees and titled my chin.  "Why?"  He asked again softly.

"I already told you why."  I sighed and fell back against the bed.  "I wasn't planning on this.  Wasn't ready.  I want more Dorian.  Not just sex.  If I wanted just sex I would have already made that move."  I sat up.  "You are fucking goregoeous.  I've wanted you since I was 15 years old.  And if it had been about sex I would have taken you out, persuaded you to let me come home with you.  We'd have walked back to your bedroom and I would have whispered the rules in your ear as I started kissing on your neck and taking off your clothes.  It wouldn't have gone down like this."

He nodded and asked another question.  "So what happened there?"

He pointed up on the bed.  "You pinned me down.  I could see what you wanted.  I panicked.  Garrett had just had his hooks in me.  I would freak out that close to his abuse.  I trust you not to hurt me Dorian, but the pain of Garrett's work was still fresh on my back."

He stood up and started pacing.  "What did I want?"  He sounded aggravated and embarrassed all at the same time.

"You wanted it rougher than I could handle in that very moment."  I stood up and stopped directly in front of him which made him stop and look up at me.  "I'm okay with that, with rough.  I'm okay with it.  But not today.  My anxiety right now is through the roof.  The conference, the new case, you and then he shows up and I could do nothing to stop him. I hadn't intended for you and I to be this intamite yet.  It scares the fucking hell out of me Dorian. I've never done this.  Never wanted it this much.  Wanted something more, to spend time with someone so much.  I've never held back my desire before Dorian.  This is all so new to me."

Dorian stood with his body pressed against mine where he had stopped.  "I sometimes forget that the rumor about you are usually true.  All the sexual partners, all the cocky attitude and all the risk.  No one ever said you were completely honest."

"Not completely.  No one knows about what Garrett did to me except you."

"You trust me that much from just this one day?"

I shrugged.  "It could be a fantasy world I base it on but yes, Dorian.  I trust you whole heartedly.  I trust you with my demons.  I trust you with my body.  But more importantly, I'm trusting you with my heart.  I will bear my soul to you if you'll let me.  I will give you everything of me. I don't know why but you make me feel safe.  Being with you makes me feel safe. I'm never safe, Dorian."

Dorian kissed me softly and it turned into a passionate kiss that left us both breathless by the end of it.  His hands cuped my face and I grinned at him.  "I'm sorry for all the shit I'm going to put you through.  I'm a mess Dorian.  But I can be yours completely if you let me."

Dorian smiled.  "We need to slow down."  I could feel my heart shattering as he spoke that simple phrase.  "We need to figure out what this all means.  You've given me a lot to think about. Nox.  We need to go slow or we will both bolt."  He kissed me softly.  "I will try with you.  Something that will be hard for me.  Something I don't do.  This type of relationship.  The closest that comes to it is the long term relationship I had with my own best friend.  But that wasn't about more than mutal gratifaction."

I blinked at him.  He'd turned my fear into hope as he continued.  I nodded.  "I should get to work."

Dorian laughed.  It felt good to hear him laugh.  To see him happy.  "You aren't leaving my side until I'm sure you are alright."

I sighed.  "I'm fine.  This isn't the first time it's happened."

"This is the first time it's happened with you awake.  So you will stay with me.  Besides I have a favor to ask of you."

"A favor?"  I winked at Dorian.

He rolled his eyes.  "And we are back to the innuendo and flirting."

I grinned at him.  "Anything for you Dorian."

"I have a 16 year old firestarter who was found on he streets of Chicago who has been presenting his mentors many problems.  I was hoping you'd talk to him be his mentor."  He smiled.  "It's why I was coming back to see if you were still in the room where I left you."

"Okay."  I said.

Dorian handed me a clean black dress shirt.  "Your's is a bloody sticky mess.  I'll have it laundered and left in your room in the morning."

We both got dressed and freshened up.  My make up was smeared beyond recovery.  I was in the process of washing it off when Dorian handed me an eyeliner pencil.  He commented, "Nostaligia."

I grinned at him.  "Thank you."

Cleaned and fresh we left Dorian's apartment to go talk to this troubled boy.
