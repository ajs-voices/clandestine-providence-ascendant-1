## The Creed of Celestial Beings

As we walked to the hotel restaurant I was surprised when Elena said quietly, "If you are capable of hurting the man who hurt you why have you not yet?"

I sighed.  "He terrifies me.  He always has."

"All the more reason to let me handle the little weasel as you said."  The look on her face made me cringe in fear of her.  It was a look of pure hatred and one that meant she would do it anyway even if I asked her not to.

"He's the reason I am the man I am.  Killing him is too merciful if you ask me."  Which she hadn't but her look softened with a wicked smile and I knew that if Elena ever got her hands on Garrett he was going to feel every ounce of pain she imagined I went through.  I asked her as she was looking at me with such feeling.  "Why would you do that for me?  You don't even know me."

Elena squeezed my hand, "We in the CCB look after our own, and when one of our own hurts another there are penalties to be had.  And you were only a boy when you were at the hands of Spencer and children are not abused.  Even James will understand."

"Who is James?"  I asked.

Elena smiled.  "You will meet James soon.  But for now you are mine.  He and Charles are dealing with other matters upstate."

"You mean the current leaders of the CCB then.  James Wright and Charles Saunders.  You know them?"

Her smile was wide.  "I know more than know them, darling.  Charles is my husband."

I grinned, "And here I thought you had your eyes on me."  I winked at her.

She blushed slightly but it left as quickly as it had come.  "Is it not warrented."  She ran her hand over my arm with a smile as we waited for the elevator to stop.  "Even as ragged as you were, the handsome man you've become was shining through."

I laughed, "You can stop acting as if you are interested Elena.  You had me at 'bask in the glory'.  I'm on board.  Though I won't kill anyone for you.  I'm done with that life."

Elena smiled.  "It is not an act nor did I doubt your conviction to the cause, but you've not yet met enough of us to fully commit.  Though if you are willing to join the organization of your tormentor I would have to think you are serious in your ideals.  At dinner we shall talk of the Creed and what it means to be part of us."

We walked into the hotel restaurant and at the sight of Elena the hostest was walking us to our table in a quiet area of the place.  I pulled Elena's chair out and she smiled up at me as she sat down.  "A gentleman even if he was homeless a mere 3 hours ago."

I laughed, "My manners never left me."

We sat down and a bottle of wine was already being poured into crystal cglasses and I had a pang of grief remembering Dorian as my ring dinged the glass as I picked it up.  Elena's voice was soft across the table from me.  "I have taken the liberty of ordering our meal so it would be ready when we got here, I hope you don't mind."

As she said that the waiter set down a rather large steak and a second plate of vegetables on the side in front of me.  I looked at him with wide eyes.  It smelled divine.  I stabbed a peice of brocolli and popped it in my mouth.  I was in heaven.  Elena watched me as I chewed slowly and savored every last bite.  I'd been living off of junk and even that junk I had lost weight.  I mumbled, "Thank you" between bites.

She smiled as she started eating on her much smaller portion of fish and pasta.

I was half way finished with the large plate of vegetables and hadn't even touched the steak yet when I asked.  "Tell me about the Creed."

Elena nodded and set her fork down and pulled a large file from her bag and set it on the table.  "This is everything you should need to know about the Creed.  How we are funded, what our aims are and how we operate.  It is very packet of information we give our new ranked officers.  But you are only a new recruit.  Not yet privy to this information, however I have talked James into allowing you this information after your initiation.  For the sole reason that if we didn't tell you straight up you would figure it out yourself.  You have resources beyond the were community.  You have tight connections inside the Venatori and even the Vampires.  You are a well known figure in the Underground because of the number of us who have had your help without ever realizing it.  You were in the Rockies, but your presence out in the world was felt even here."

I was dumbfounded by the knowledge.  I hadn't thought I was doing anything to be noticed outside the Venatori.  "You said initiation."

"That won't be for several more weeks if you truly decide to stay with us.  You will be placed in one of hostels and given a job - a normal, mundane job not pretending to be a magician of note."

I snickered.  "But it's so fun pulling the wool over human's eyes."

She winked at me.  "I'm sure you love it.  It was fun watching even if I knew you were using your gift.  You were entertaining, and such a flirt even when you wore rags the girls and some of the boys kept coming back each day."  Elena placed on top of the folder.  "This is the address of the hostel you will be staying with.  You can have your things delivered here."

"My things?"

"You are a resourceful hunter.  A hunter who was in the field for 10 years before living on the street I doubt you left the Venatori with nothing to fall back on."

I nodded. "If you knew I had a fall back plan why are you recruiting me."

She reached across the table and caressed the angry tattoo on my temple, "I already told you darling, this, " she touched my fingers on the table, "and this.  "  Her hands pulled away from me slowly, "And your rousing speach in the hotel room were all wonderful examples of how you can help us.  Some of us beleive as you others not so much, but we all do what we can.  Garrett was right about one thing, Nox.  You can help us, even if my Charles doesn't beleive so."

Elena set a phone on top of the pile.  "Can you text your friend?"

I nodded.  She pushed the entire pile to me.  "I trust you she said.  You will join us."

I picked up the phone and typed in Ant's number and texted him.  [i]New number.  I'm in.  Drop things off at address. - Nox[/i]  I hit send and turned the phone to her so she could read as I placed it back on the pile the screen still on.

She smiled.  "I'm in?  Part of some larger plan?"

I shrugged.  "Honestly I don't know.  I was told to fall.  So that's what I did.  This is where it lead me."

"I wouldn't have thought you'd share that with me.  Venatori are always so tight lipped."

I shrugged.  "Why should I hide from it?  You would have figured it out.  You are resourceful."

Elena laughed.  "Turnabout is fair play.  Finish your dinner.  I'm sure you are looking forward to sleeping in a real bed with real pillows and blankets."

I nodded, "But actually I'd like to hit the gym first, if you don't mind."

"Not at all, Nox.  It is your life.  I will be by in the morning to introduce you to your new family.  And they will indoctrinate you to our way of life.  I'm sure you will find it similar to living at the AU building."

The phone blinked and Elena turned it so I could read.  [i]Okay.[/i]

He's a talkative one. "That was not Ant.  Likely it was his mother who is a technophobe and always proper."

"Why would Il Cane be answering her son's texts?"

I smiled.  "Probably because I texted her and not Ant.  My last contact with my friends said that he was out of town and I should text her instead if need arose.  "  I waved my hand at Elena.  "Need arose."

"You have The Hound's phone number memorized?"

I smiled.  "I hunt vampires for a living, Duckling.  When you step into vampire territory it is good to have a few cards to play.  Vampires like to handle their own business so I alert her to my cases.  She gives me the results I need and she's there if I need help."

"So you've meet the Hound?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I've never spoken to anyone in her crew other than Ant and Ryan, her Chevalier.  Though Jack has done me a few favors with computer shit."

"And how many Alpha's do you know?"

I shrugged.  "Enough.  Here in New York, I only now Adrian.  In the rockies when I'm hunting a were I always find the Alpha and ask for help or permission which ever is the easiest in that territory."

"You know I don't think I have ever heard of a Venatori hunter who asks permission.  This must be the reason you make so many waves here in the courts."  

"You have now."
