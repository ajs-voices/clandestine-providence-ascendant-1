## Day of Bliss

I could think of a great many things I'd like to do with Dorian that day, but we walked down the stairs hand in hand and out of the AU building int the busy morning streets of New York.  We walked for several blocks without saying anything.  Dorian's hand locked in mine rubbing gentle circles on the back of my hand.

We walked through Central Park still in silence.  We walked for nearly an hour hand in hand with no words shared.  It wasn't awkward but I wanted to do something, other than walk.  "Do you want to go dancing Dorian?"

He looked at me with a surprise. "Uh."  He looked at me and grinned.  "Sure why not."

"Perfect."  I smiled.  "I know this place around the corner you should like."

Dorian looked like he wanted to frown or run away from my suggestion.  I gripped his hand tighter and drew him in closer to me.  "You'll like it I promise."

Dancing was one of those things I had enjoyed doing most of my life.  It was my first attempt at integrating into a mundane world - humans liked to dance and I was only 10 when I left the Academy the first time seeking human companionship since Venatori ones weren't exactly the greatest thing in the world for me.

I found this little dance studio and enrolled in classes.  I smiled when I saw the familiar building and rang the bell.  A soft voice scratched over the little intercom.  "May I help you?"

"Is Margarette in?"  I asked.

"Who's asking?"  

"Nox.  I was hoping to steal an hour or two of studio time."

The door buzzed and we walked in as the intercome said, "Come on up."

Dorian looked puzzeled and I smiled at him. We walked the two flights of stairs up to the dance studio and a woman in pink leotards and barefoot stood waiting.  Her hair was grayer than I remembered but she wore the same smile I adored.  I offered her my hand and she let me bring it to my lips for a kiss.  She rolled her eyes as I said.  "Margarette, this is Dorian, my boyfriend.  Dorian Ms. Margarette Cheateu dance instructor to the stars."

"A nice surprise, Nox.  Dorian do come in."  She held the door forus and let it close behind her.  There was a dance class in progress, a group of ten girls all practicing different ballet steps as a warm up.  Dorian looked at me with shock.

"Do I looke like a ballerina to you?"  I asked.

Dorian grinned.  "I wouldn't put it past you."

Margarette's laugh was like summer bells sounding on the wind.  "Nox tried ballet once.  The girls were a little mean."

I stuck my tongue at her, "Only a little.  They laughed at the outfit you made me wear."

"That's not what they were laughing at."

"I'm fully aware of what they were laughing at.  I was 13 and just figuring out things."

Dorian chuckled.  It was almost a giggle.  I looked back at him as he continued his plight of laughter.  We walked into the next classroom.  Margarette flipped on the light and it was an elegant ballroom filled with luscous curtains and no mirrors.  I walked over to the record player that would fill the whole room with music.  "We aren't exactly dressed to impress Dorian. But.." I turned the record player on and a slow waltz started playing.  I held my hand out to him and asked, "Do you want to dance with me?"

"You can waltz?"  

I nodded as I closed the distance between us until I was standing in front of him.  "I can waltz, mambo, salsa, cha cha, foxtrot and tango among many others."

Margarette smiled.  "Here.  Let's show him."  She took my hand and wisked me away in her leotard and me in my jeans.  It wasn't going to look luxurious but it was still fun to dance.

I warned.  "I'm a little rusty."

We danced and the only thing I could think about was wanting it to be Dorian.  He tapped Margarette on the shoulder.  "I think I got it now."

She smiled and left us alone in the room with the music playing.  I fell into the female position and let Dorian lead.  He looked at me and smiled.  "I expected an arguement."

I laughed.  "I learned both parts because most men don't, and I like to dance Dorian.  I always have.  And since I like men, we both can't do the same thing with each other."

He kissed me softly and we danced around the dance floor.

We lost track of time.  I was in the middle of showing Dorian the jive when my phone went of in several rapid text message.  I looked at him, "You turned my phone back on."

He looked a little guilty.  "I didn't want you to have a panic attack if something came through and you didn't know about it later.  I'd forgotten I'd done it honestly."

He took it out of his back pocket and handed it to me without even looking at the text on the front screen.  I smiled.  "I would have been alright."

Dorian nodded.  "I wouldn't have been.  I could easily prevent it."

I glanced at it and was surprised to see that particular name on my phone now.  It was still daylight.  It read.  "Emergency.  NYC meeting place - now!"

I turned the phone to Dorian.  "I have an emergency to attend to.  Do you want to go for a walk with me?  This could be construed as me breaking my no field work regiment."

Dorian nodded.  "Will you stop if I tell you to?"

I nodded.  "If it's dangerous, yes.  I'll listen Dorian.  My care is in your hands right now."

He took me by the hand.  "Lead the way then."

I found Maragette teaching the class and left the fee for the use of the studio on the desk by the door.  She nodded and waved and the girls all giggled as we left the studio.

We were down in the subway tunnels about to get on the train.  "We are going to meet a vampire."

Dorian's eyes were wide.  "Okay.  Why?"

"Ant says there is an emergency.  And if he's in NYC that means Il Cane is as well and that can be a problem with the local vamps."

"Il Cane is in New York.  How do you know?"

"Ant is her son.  He rarely leaves her side.  He's either a scout, on a mission for her, or she's here, eithre way when the Son of the Hound says there is an emergency I listen."

"How do you know him?"  Dorian sounded a little distant and jealous.

"I hunted his mother on my first Hunt.  It was a big joke to most, but I took it seriously.  Instead of finding Cari, I found Ant and Ryan.  Every couple of years I hunt her down and Ant and I have a few drinks."

"And?"  Dorian asked.

I smiled.  "Yes.  Dorian.  I've slept with him once or twice.  But I haven't in over three years.  And I've seen him three times over those years."

"Why did you stop?"

I shrugged.  "Out grew it?  I don't know honestly.  He'd feed and that was that.  We'd have a few drinks, chat about his mom and Ryan.  I think he had a girlfriend or wife or whatever the primeval vamps call their mates.  It's not serious."

"And this emergency?"  Now he really sounded jealous.

"He wouldn't say there is an emergency if he wanted to have sex.  He wouldn't even call me if that's what he wanted.  We only slept together because he can't turn off the lust while feeding.  I got carried away, and he fell into the rythm of it all easily because I didn't give him much choice in the matter."

"Nox... I don't"

"This is our stop."  I took Dorian's hand and dragged him out of the train.  "Look Dorian.  I'm not going to lie to you about any of my past.  I don't want there to be secrets or lies.  Ant and I had sex.  That's all it was.  There are a lot of people who I've had sex with."  I stepped closer to him and whisepred in his ear.  "But there is no one in the entire world who has ever made me feel what I feel for you.  You brighten my day.  You brighten my nights.  I don't want or need anyone but you."

Dorian pulled away from me a little and nodded towards the wall at the man staring at us.  I smiled at him then back at Dorian.  "That's Ant."  I let go of his hands.  "Are you okay?"

Dorian sighed.  "I'm still getting used to you and your past."

I nodded.  "I'd take it all away if I could Dorian.  Make it so that it never happened.  Be that young naive little boy and let you show me the ways of the world, but that isn't going tohappen.  I love you here and now and that's all I need."

Dorian smiled. "You love me?"

I looked down and laughed before I looked up at him with a smile. "You heard that huh?"  I stepped forward put my hands on Dorian's wrists and kissed him softly.  "I love you Dorian."

He was beaming at me as he put his hand on my waist and turned me to walk to the vampire who was paitently waiting for our public display of affection to end.
