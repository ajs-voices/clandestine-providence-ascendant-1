## Little Blue Pills

I ate more than my fill and there was still enough food for later. Dorian even ate some.  I was tired but I didn't want to sleep while I only had a few hours of time to spend with Dorian.  Which he convinced me I had to do my hair.  He trimmed it carefully.  I didn't like being the complete center of his focus but then I didn't want it anywhere else either.  It felt strange having Dorian fussing over me like a child.  It took all my effort not to feel like I needed to smart off to him or to be rebelious against his instructions.  

His fingers in my hair made me shiver.  And then when he started filling in the dark color at the roots of my hair I felt even more awkward.  I had never liked going to a hairdresser for things like this - something I could easily do myself, but when I tried to do it myself against Dorian's instructions I found my arms hurting.  Physical Therapy was going to hurt big time - even more so than the burn.  I didn't think anything could be worse than that.  Now I know better.

Dorian was careful with the tips as well he said I couldn't see the color he'd chosen to dye my hair.  I was a little worried.  I wasn't fond of bright colors and prayed he didn't choose one.  While we waited I drew and Dorian watched me.  I felt even more childish as I sat with crayons and paper sketching out patterns before I set to sketching out him.  He was staring at me I could repay the favor.  He had only grinned at me as I'd flipped the page and started.

But the crayon's weren't working well so I flipped the page and conjoured up a pencil from nothing.  Dorian laughed.  "If I'd know you could do that I'd not have brought crayons."

I grinned.  "Crayon's don't work well when you need to erase things. And besides I like crayons."

Dorian sat up and watched as I started sketching his profile on the page.  "What else can you conjour up like that?"

I looked up at him.  "Anything I've studied the pattern of.  Any object with no mechanical parts.  I can conjour the parts but not moving ones all at the same time.  So things like guns I can't do, but the trigger, or the hammer and all the small peices together but it wouldn't be perfect and I wouldn't want to fire it."

"Anything living?"  Dorian asked.

I shook my head and set the paper and pencil aside.  "You know you can't create living things."

Dorian smiled, "And before the other day I thought healing was impossible."

"It is in the sense that you are healing them.  You aren't healing someone.  You are providing extra resources so the body can heal itself.  I don't expect you could do the same thing with a human who heals slowly."

"So tell me the mechanics then."

I nodded.  "There really isn't much to it.  There are technically five elements."

"That is new."

I smiled.  "The fifth element isn't bendable.  It exists between all patterns living or not.  If you were to zoom into the spaces between a pattern you could see little sparks.  Those sparks can be coased into things, like healing.  But you can't make it do anything, bend it to your will.  It's like an willful child and disobedient.  It has a mind of it's own.  Some scientists might call it the god particle.  It is the essense of everything living.  It sparks and transmits life.  You fuel a body with these life particles and the elements of the universe.  Together in unison they can heal a repairing body.  You can't replicate something from a once living thing, but you can from a living one, like cutting off a leaf and allowing it to take root.  You can dulpicate a plant because that is how it works in nature.  Our cells don't work like that on a large scale.  Could it be possible to clone a human from a cut off finger, or a peice of hair, maybe with years of study on the subject in genetics and dna and the patterns of life, but one without the other is doing to not work."

"Most of what I do is pure chemistry and physics.  I learned the basics in school and it lead me into different studies once I realized that the laws and such were very similar."

Dorian was wide eyed and listening carefully to every word I said.  "If I can get you a laptop can you write it all down?  Everything that's in your genius head?"

I shrugged.  "If you want me to, but I'm no genius.  Just a kid who plays with patterns."

Dorian stood up and started taking the headgear off.  His internal clock must have told him it was done, because we didn't set a timer for it.  I didn't even have my phone because I could use it to hurt myself.  I doubted they would let me have my laptop, maybe under supervision.

I closed my eyes and let Dorian finish his task.  I enjoyed his touch this time more than the last.  I was getting used to his care.  

When he was done he ran a comb through the top and styled it how he liked.  I didn't normally do anything other than run my fingers through it.  He helped me stand up and look at my reflection in the window.  Dorian had chosen a saphire blue color to highlight the tips of my hair, there were still stands of red running everywhere.  I grinned at him as he helped me sit back down in the bed.

He glanced down at his watch.  "I should get going.  I don't want to make them mad at me on the first day."

I nodded.  "Okay.  Thank you Dorian."  I paused, "For everything."

Dorian stood over me with a smile.  "Anytime love."  He leaned down and kissed me tenderly before he nicked the pencil and tapped it against my head.  "No more pencils I don't want you to get in trouble."

"Yes, sir," I said with a smile.  

He kissed my forehead and headed for the door.  "Tomorrow I will see about pooling our resources again.  I will eat well and sleep well tonight to insure that I'm well rested."

"Okay."

Dorian left just as Madison was opening the door.  Dorian let her in the stepped out.  She smiled.  "I was just coming to tell you visiting hours were over, and dinner will be served soon if you'd like to join the other residents."

I shrugged, "Why not?  I'm not sure I can walk that far today."

She smiled and flicked her purple locks from her face.  "We'll get a wheel chair for now.  Until you can move freely."

I sighed.  "I suppose."  

Madison pulled the wheelchair in from the hall and helped me get in the contraption and pushed me towards the dining hall.  She asked, "Did you have a good time with Dorian?"

She flicked a stray hair back into place.  I grinned.  "I always have a good time with Dorian."

"I assumed you have him naked and breathless when I walked in.  Didn't even look like you two were more than friends.  So not the Nox I remember."

"We all grow up sometimes."  I said flatly.

The dinning room was larger than I thought it would be.  It was full of people considered mentally unhealthy for whatever reason.  I could see several Magnus in the place, and a few other supernatural beings but what I saw more than not was Tacet.  They made me shiver, the fact that they had their givtl purged from their souls left mine aching in return.  To not have my ability would be a fate worse than death.  I wouldn't be me, and I was sure that they weren't who they had once been.

Madison rolled me up to a table.  "This will be your table from here on out."  She pointed to a little girl with blond braids and said, "This is Lori.  The girl next to Lori sat slightly taller than the blonde.   Her name was Jo and I could tell she was a were, but she was different than others I'd seen like she wasn't fully formed.

Madison pointed to a very large black man, "This is Julian."  He gave her a dirty look.  "He likes to be called Duke though."  She leaned forward and whispered, "And I'd call him that no matter what."

The final person who came later than I did Madison introduced, "This is Cliff", Madison hesitated and pointed to the empty chair next to him, "And this is Ameilia."

Ameilia's chair was sitting next to me so I offered her my hand and mimed shaking it and pulling it to my lips with a kiss.  "A pleasure Ameilia."  The look on Cliff's face made him light up.  I had acknowledged his friend.  

Madison just shook her head and muttered, "Always a flirt."  Her voice rose to include everyone, "This is Nox.  He'll be staying with us for a while."

Lori giggled.  "He likes Ameilia."

I smiled.  "I like everyone."

An orderly with a cart full of pills placed labeled pill cups in front of everyone and I looked down at the pill with two little blue pills in them and frowned.  "What's this?"

Madison leaned in a whispered.  "Everyone takes something.  It's an inclusion thing to help those who have to.  It's a sugar pill if you aren't on anything."

I nodded.  "Down the hatch."  I swallowed the pills without water.  They had an aftertaste that I didn't particularly like.  I decided water was best suited for the task next time.  

Food arrived under covered trays and everyone waited until everyone was served.  My stomach rumbled at the sudden sight of food.  It ached; I ached.  

The last plate was served and everyone in near unison was uncovering their plates.  Lori looked at my plate and laughed.  "You can have anything you want next time."

I grinned.  "This is what I want."  

Lori laughed.  "You ar weird.  What happened to you?"

"What do you mean?"  I asked.

"The wheel chair, or do you not walk ever?  You don't look frail like the others who are chair bound."

"Ah.  I shattered the bones in my body catching a bad guy.  They think I did it to kill myself.  Thus why I'm here."

The little wolf spoke softly, "Suicide watch sucks.  I'm surprised they let you have a knife, or anything sharp at all."

"Voluntary admission.  Suppose to help.  This is not the first time, nor the last, I'm sure."

The little blond twirled her hair as she poked at the pancakes with strawberry's on top with her fork.  She didn't look hungry, or act hungry but I was famished and hadn't realized that I'd finished most of the vegetables on my plate as we spoke.

Cliff interrupted.  "Ameilia says that you are cute."

I grinned at the man, "Of course I am.  But thank you Ameilia I appreciate it coming from someone so lovely herself."

Cliff blushed and hid himself behind his hands as he ate.  

Jo growled and rolled her eyes.  "You know she's not real right?"

I shrugged.  "She's real to Cliff.  We all see things a little differently.  Maybe Cliff here is seeing a ghost of some lost soul who doesn't want to move on.  Yeah it could be in his head, but I know things in my head are real."  I sighed as I finished the last bite on my plate and my stomach rumbled again as if I'd not eaten at all.

Lori giggled and handed me her plate.  I looked at it with disdain but I ate it anyway.  I was going to pay for this later.  I could feel the carbs sitting on my hips.  Duke laughed, "He's eating like a horse.  How do you stay so thin?"

"I don't normally eat this much, but my body needs healing fuel.  I did a number on myself before the jump, now it's worse."  I said and I hoped that's all it was.  My body just healing I didn't want to keep eating this much forever.  I felt like the Flash in the comics always hungry and always eating.
