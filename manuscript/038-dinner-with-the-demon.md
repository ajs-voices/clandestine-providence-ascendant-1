## Dinner with the Demon

I grabbed a shower and put on jeans and a t-shirt with a gray hoodie over it all.  I wanted to spend the night with Dorian, but that wasn't for a few more hours.  I sighed as I headed towards Garrett's apartment.  It was not a far walk really and I was going to arrive around the same time the wine did which would be a good thing.

I stood in front of the door about ready to knock but I couldn't make myself do it.  But the wine arrived and the man knocked on the door.  I heard shuffling feet towards the door and then a squeal as the door rattled open.  Aidan stared up at me as the man handed the adult behind him the wine.  

Garrett laughed.  "Your boyfriend ordered the wine.  You can't even manage a simple request."

I glared at him as he opened the door for me to walk inside.  Stella was brightly sitting on the bar opening the wine and pouring it.  "Hey Nox.  So glad you can join us."

I nodded and smiled at her.  I still couldn't talk, my body moved out of habit and I knew where Garrett wanted me before he even spoke.  I stood helpless in my fear as his hand touched my arm to get my attention before pointing to a chair.  I sat down and Aidan crawled up in my lap.  It brought my attention to him and I smiled at him.  "Hey Aidan."

He grinned up at me.  "Can you show me how to make a fireball again?"

Stella looked at me with fear in her eyes.  I grinned at him.  "I don't think your mom wants me to show you that here.  How about water?"

He nodded and I formed a ball of water above my hand slowly and watched as Aidan took in each movement.  I could see his eyes folowing each strand and each twist and turn before he held his hand out and made one too.  "See Mommy, I can do it too."

Garrett looked at me with pride in his eyes.  I wasn't sure if it was for me or for Aidan, but I didn't like it either way.  I was not his puppet.  "He's not even been tested yet."

I looked at my once upon a time mentor and smiled at him.  "Children like games.  It's easy to teach them to be safe with all the elements without even knowing what they can touch.  But I knew all of them could be Cesari with the right training."

Garrett smiled.  "I knew you'd have much to give to the Venatori when I first met you."

I rolled my eyes.  "I'm sure you did."

Stella smiled at Aidan, "That is so wonderful."  But she didn't sound sincere, more afraid.  Afraid of her own son... my heart ached for Aidan.  His mother was afraid of him.  The man she was dating I feared for his own life.  And here he sat completely ignorant of thsoe things around him.

Garrett worked in the kitchen finishing the final touches on his dinner which actually smelled rather good.  My stomach rumbled and Aidan giggled at the sound.  "Mommy, Nox's tummy is hungry."

I grinned down at him.  "I'm alright I can wait till Garrett is done."

The little boy hopped down and grabbed a carrot stick and handed it to me.  "Vegetables can be eaten any time."

"I like that rule." I took the carrot stick from him and snapped it between my teeth as Garrett looked at me with his slimey smile.

I froze mid-chew and he laughed.  "Dinner is ready.  Aidan go washyour hands."

Stella took her son towards the bathroom to assist him.  I got up to help Garrett and he smiled again at me.  "I have a favor to ask of you."

"Of course you do."  I said flatly.  I didn't like the way he said favor.  I didn't like the way he was looking at me.

He stood in front of me and pressed me against the counter as if he were my lover and he laughed softly.  It was very unsettling. "You will get me Mark Green's agenda for the next few weeks."

He grabbed me behind my neck and dug his fingers into my neck.  "Imagine what I could do to your little friend if you don't listen to me."

The water in the enxt room stopped running and Aidan came running out to sit at the table.  I nodded and moved away from Garrett.  I could feel his hands on my neck, his body pressed against mine.  I felt the soft caress of air against my check as it snaked arcorss my body.  I closed my eyes as I walked around the bar to sit down next to Aidan.

It took everything I had not freak out while I shared a meal with my demon.  He threatened me and mine and I could do nothing but what he wanted out of fear.  We finished dinner and I helped Garrett with the dishes.  He smiled at me as I washed them and he dried them.  

If it weren't for the fact that it was Garrett's house and Garrent's dinner I might have had a good time.  I glanced at my phone and saw the time.  "I need to go."

"So early?"

I shrugged.  "I have other plans to tend to."

Garrett laughed.  "Meeting with your blue-eyed lover?"  He grabbed my elbow and guided me to the door and smiled.  "You will bring me that information in two days time.  Or you might find yourself a little lonelier than you remembered ever being."

I nodded as he opened the door and stepped through.  He chuckled softly, "Two days Nox.  And say hi to Dorian Vega for me.  Tell him I know exactly what he sees in you."

I walked away from the door and towards the stairs.  I walked numbly up the stairs.  I was not feeling much like company but I had promised to see Dorian before 8.  It was only a few flights of stairs but when I reached the right floor my legs felt like dead weights and I was walking slower than normal.  I stopped in front of Dorian's door and knocked.  I was still a little dazed when he opened his door and smiled at me.  

I felt better the moment I looked into his eyes.  I stepped into him and kissed him long and hard.  A throat cleared behind Dorian and I took a step back.  "I'm sorry."

Dorian smiled and pulled me closer as he moved to let me in.  He closed the door after I'd stepped inside my body still pressed against him.  I heard the familiar voice of his friend Todd.  "Oh get a room."

I smiled and leaned my forehead against Dorian's.  "I didn't know you'd have company."

Dorian smiled and walked towards the kitchen and handed me a glass of water.  "I didn't know he was going to stop by.  Todd was just showing me some of his work."

"Ah.  What is it you do Todd?"

He smiled at me with a prefectly white smile and ice blue eyes that light up when he looked at us.  "I'm a genetisist."

"And you came to Dorian for what?"  I asked.

Dorian laughed.  "Just a second set of eyes to see if I thinks he's on the correct path."

"And is he?"  I asked as I sat down on the couch.  Dorian sat down next to me with his wine glass and I put my hand in his lap.  

Dorian smiled.  "I think you'd be far better an determining that."

"Really?"  I asked.

"Of course," he said.  "Show him Todd."

"I doubt our young friend here will understand it.  He was never very good with school things, just getting beat up."  Todd chuckled as he handed me some diagrams.

I looked at them and I really didn't have much to say about them.  "What am I looking at?"

"Genetic maps."

I laid them down on the coffee table one at a time and I started to see patterns come together.  "This one has elements almost identical to the other three."

Todd choked on his wine and he coughed it up into his hands.  Dorian hurried to the kitchen and got Todd a towel.  

"I take it I was right?"  

Dorian laughed.  "Yeah.  We both agreed with him.  Except he didn't tell you anything, you just found it."  He handed Todd the towel.  "Nox is good with patterns.  He doesn't need to understand the logic behind it, he just sees it.  I've come to learn to trust his judgement in such things these past few weeks."

Todd nodded.  "I think that I will leave the two of you alone."

Dorian walked Todd to the door and I leaned back against Dorian's couch and took in the scents with my eyes closed.  I felt Dorian standing in front of me.  I opened my eyes and he was looking down at me with a glass of wine touching his lips.  I took his hand and pulled him down into my lap.  He sat facing me his legs on either side of me and an arm resting on the couch back behind me and the other holding his wine glass with elegance.

"How are you doing love?"

I smiled up at him.  "He asked me to get information about Mark Green."

He nodded.  "Did he say why?"

"I didn't ask.  I could barely talk much less question his motives.  He threatened Aidan and you."

"He can't hurt us."  Dorian leaned down and kissed me softly on the lips.

I turned my head to the side and instead of stopping Dorian sucked on my ear lobe and my neck which made a guttral sound escape my mouth even as I whispered.  "He can.  And I have to listen."
