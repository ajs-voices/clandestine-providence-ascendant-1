## Fire Starter

I pulled on the orange t-shirt over my head as Dorian pulled a clean white one from his drawer.  I grinned at him as his tattoo'd arm was showing and I'd never seen him in anything other than dress clothes.  I bit my bottom lip and Dorian chuckled softly, "That's not helping any."

I grinned at him.  "Duckling, ain't nuttin gonna fix that right now but I can't stop wanting you."

Dorian kissed me deeply and we almost fell back into bed, but there were more important matters to attend to.  Problems with kids came before our libido.  Dorian pulled away breathlessly and sighed.  "Let's go."

We took the elevator down two floors, I pressed myself against Dorian for more than one reason but his arms wrapped around my waist as I hid my face in the crook of his neck and bit at his neck playfully to distract myself and to continue the current mood we were in.  His hand ran small circles against the small of my back under my shirt that sent shivers down my spine.  There were a few gasps when the doors opened the floor above our destination.  From the whisperes I could tell that my shirt had ridden up my back and they'd seen the scares, the fact that we were two men cuddling in the elevator wasn't the problem this time.  

Dorian pulled the back of my shirt down and I straightened still pressing myself into him as the doors opened to our floor and we got off to more whispers.

Stella was staying in a low end resident area but had a higher end apartment with two bedrooms.  Single mom with a Magnus gained her some status even though she was human.  Dorian knocked on the door as he ran his fingers through his hair to straighten it some.  I laughed.  "There is no fixing it without a mirror.  There is no getting out of the fact that we were just making out."

I turned him to face me and kissed him softly just as the door opened and Stella gasped.  "What the hell!"

I grinned sheepishly at her, "Sorry."

Her jaw dropped, "Nox? What are you doing here?"

Dorian blushed.  "I was with Dorian when you called."  I said plainly.

"Oh."  Stella blushed.  "So you know then?"

"Know who Aidan's father is? Yes.  You said there was something wrong.  Important enough to call four times."

She opened the door still in shock.  "Yeah."

We walked in and I followed.  Stella's apartment was fairly well decorated and there were toys lying all over the floor in front of the TV, there were dirty dishes in the sink and I took a deep breath and tried not to let it bother me.  "Don't mind the mess."  Stella said as if she had read my mind.  "A four year old doesn't lend to a clean house."

I groaned softly under my breath which I received a quick jab from Dorian's elbow in my stomach, Stella thankfully hadn't heard it.  "He's this way."  She said.

She led us to a room with the door wide open and Aidan cozily sleeping in his bed but there was a wall of air blocking the door and I laughed.  "This is your emergency?"

Dorian didn't find it funny.  "What's wrong, Stella?"

Stella glared at me, "Try to go in."

Dorian did and ran into the wall.  He took a step back and focused.  "Oh."

I found the tied off portion of the blocked wall and undid the offending pattern of air.  "Why did he do that?"

Stella just looked at me with fury.  "What am I going to do now?  What if there is a fire? Or what if he's choking.  I can't get to my son."

"The wall is gone now Stella."  I said flatly.  "Why was he keeping you out?  What did you do?"

"I didn't do anything.  He's my son!" Stella cried out.

"You said something, did something that made him want to keep you out.  Sparks happen due to emotion distability."

Stella rushed into Aidan's room and scooped the sleeping child up into her arms waking him.  "He's my son, what do you know of it anyway!"

I frowned. "I know a lot about it actually since I was a fire-starter.  At least Aidan didn't start a fire.  My mother was yelling at me for making a mess.  She grabbed me by the arm and my mind started a fire out of fear.  It wasn't anything I could control because I didn't have any training.  A natural Magnus of enough power will spark at a young age.  Most never notice it because they are innocous ones.  Sand everywhere, a momentary gust of wind, wet areas that were previously dry.  Fire is the only one that guarantee's danger."  My voice was flat and emotionless as I retold the story of my youth.  Dorian's hand was at the small of my back.

Aidan rubbed at his eyes, "Mommy, why are you waking me up?"

Stella sighed and put her little one back in bed.  "I just love you so much baby.  Go back to sleep."  She put him down in his bed and tucked him in while Dorian and I moved into the living area again.  

I started cleaning up.  It was bothering me that much.  Dorian stood and watched me, I could feel his eyes on me while I picked up the legos and matchbox cars and put them in their related boxes.  

Stella walked right past me and into her kitchen and pulled down a bottle of wine and opened it.  She poured herself a glass and then as a second though pulled a second one down and handed hers to Dorian.  "What's he doing?"

Dorian chuckled.  "I think he's cleaning your house."

"Why?"

Dorian continued to answer for me as I picked up the toys on the floor.  "He's a neat freak."  I saw him grin from the top of his wine glass. "More to the point he dislikes when things aren't organized.  Not so much clean but neat."

Stella frowned, "He's going to suck as a parent. Always picking things up."

I stacked the toy boxes in a corner and smiled at Stella. "No I won't suck.  I"ll just be doing a lot of organizing things."

I moved into the kitchen.  "I'm washing the dishes because you look like you could use the help.  Not that you can't or won't but I can at least help with this."

Stella frowned at Dorian.  "Is he always like this?"

Dorian shrugged as I walked past and startd the sink water to running.  "I would assume so."

"You mean you don't know?  You are sleeping with a guy you don't even know that well?"  She sounded angry.  "You wouldn't sleep with me for like three weeks."

I laughed.  "Technically we've not slept together yet, in that way anyway, and we've been together for what, three months now Dorian?"

He laughed, "Two of them you were in a coma so they don't count."

I shrugged from the sink.  "Semantics."

I finished the dishes and stood next to Dorian as he leaned against the bar in Stella's kitchen.  "I'll help Aidan with his sparking tomorrow when we are in class together, it shouldn't happen again."

Stella returned to the kitchen and poured herself another glass of wine and spoke so we couldn't see her face.  "It's kinda ironic that my ex and Aidan's father is hooking up with the guy who wouldn't sleep with me."

I laughed and Doran looked at me with a frown.  "I didn't sleep with her."

He asked, "Did you want to?"

"Yes, but I wouldn't.  She's a mother of a child - a single mother.  I have rules Dorian."

He sighed with a nod and grabbed my belt loop and pulled me close.  "I remember what you told Daniella.  No one underage, no single parents, noone who is married."

Stella turned around she looked angry.  "Dorian's a single parent."

"Not unless you give him custody to Aidan he's not.  He has no children he's the sole guardian too."

Stella sat down at her bar and frowned ar our closeness but when I moved to pull away Dorian held me tight against him.  I couldn't have moved if I had tried harder.  Stella said quiety. "He's still single and a parent."

I smiled at her, "Does that mean you will let him help raise your son?"

Stella frowned, "I don't know.  I'm not sure I like his friends."

"Don't like me?  Or you don't like the fact that he's dating a man?"  I could feel the blood rushing to my face in anger.  Dorian rubbed the small of my back and handed me the glass of wine.  I took a sip but only because Dorian asked me to calm down.

Dorian spoke quietly.  "My friends aren't going to change.  Nox and I are going to go back to my apartment now that the crisis has been averted."

Dorian didn't wait for her to say okay or agree he pulled me after him out her front door and we took the stairs up to his room.  We stopped outside his door with a soft smile.  "I'm sorry about tonight."

I smiled.  "No worries Dorian.  I still had a great time."

Dorian unlocked his door.  "I should tell you to go home now."  I nodded.  He grabbed my belt loops again and pulled me against him.  "But I'd really like to finish what we started."

I kissed Dorian softly.  "Me too.  But we've both got to get up in the morning.  And if I come in we won't be doing much sleeping."

Dorian nodded.  "My thoughts exactly."

"Can I see you tomorrow?"  I asked.

"You can see me anytime Nox."  He pulled me against his body tighter and I groaned against the feel of his body.  We kissed deep and throughly until he pulled away breathless.  "I'll see you tomorrow love."

I stepped back and watched Dorian open his door and step inside. "Tomorrow love."

Dorian closed the door and I went to my room, which didn't have a bed but I'd slept in worse places before.
