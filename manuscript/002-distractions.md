## Distractions

I was afraid of flying, it wasn't the airplanes fault, or the pilots.  It was my mother's fault.

I had just turned five when I was on my first flight.  It probably wouldn't have been so bad if it were not for the fact that only hours before my mother was spiting at me and calling me a monster.  And hours before that I had sparked.  I watched as a time flicker of flame caught fire on the curtains.  I remember it clear as day.

I remember that tiny little pattern coalesce and form and take light with only my thoughts to guide it.  I know it was me.  I knew then it was me.  My mother knew it was me too.  

I took a deep breath and swallowed the memory into the depths of my mind again.  I disliked thinking about her - about my mother - the woman who gave me away without a second thought.  I hated her.  I could hear Margo's words screaming back at me now.  _"You don't hate her.  You are angry.  You have every right to be but hate is a very strong word."_  It was something she said to me often when the topic of my mother came up.

There was a warm hand with rose scent wafting up from my arm that brought me back to my senses.  Stella asked, "You okay?  We are almost there."

I nodded my head.  I didn't trust my words as I shifted our things to the other side so I could get my ID out of my wallet in my back pocket.  It was a Colorado issued drivers license however I had never taken a driving test so to speak at least not in Colorado.  I had in New York City where I grew up but that was a long time ago.

The picture was a poor representation of myself but it at least looked like me.  Jace's never had, but then again he had a black eye the day he took the picture.

It wasn't the stewardess at the counter that I knew who took our tickets.  She didn't think twice about the fact that we weren't actually together.  Two separate parties but our seats were together and we looked like a happy little family, but we were complete strangers.

We walked down the narrow cat walk that connected the terminal to the airplane and I could feel my heart starting to race.  I could feel the sweat starting to form at the base of my neck.  Stella was in front of me and for that I was grateful.  She turned around to make sure I was still following and she frowned.  "You really don't like to fly do you?"

I shook my head.  "No, but I'll be fine."

Several other passengers behind us rushed passed us as we stood in the catwalk.  I drapped my arm around the tiny redhead and rubbed the little boy's shoulder and hurried us along the rest of the way.  There was no better way to do this than to just get it done.  Stella commented, "Like a band-aid."

I laughed softly, "Did I say that out loud?"

She patted my hand, "Yep."

I apologized, "Sorry.  I'll try not to let that happen again."

Stella squeezed my hand and we entered the plane single file with her things trailing behind me as I lugged everything through the narrow passage ways.  My friend greeted me at the door way and winked at me slyly.  I rolled my eyes once I was past her.  I wasn't exactly in the playing mood right now - she knew this.

Stella found our seats and stopped to set Aidan in the seat and asked, "Can I have his seat?"  

I managed to get it undone from the set up Stella had manuevered and  handed it her without knocking anyone in the head.  There were people waiting behind us to get past and I turned and apologized to them  but the were rude anyway.  I didn't hurry on principle then.

Stella got Aidan in the seat by the window strapped into his car seat and the airplane seat and she was trying to get inside the row so I could put things away.  The man behind me tried to push me and I turned and grinned at him.  "Sorry.  Women and children first."

He gave me a nasty glare.  I laughed and picked up the stroller and started to put it away in the overhead bin with the rest of our things.  I grabbed the magazine I'd bought and my earbuds from my things and sat down slowly next to Stella as she fussed with her son.  He was not happy to be strapped in from the sounds of things.

Stella busied her self with changing Aidan while we awaited on the plane. I could hear my pulse in my ears.  I knew that my palms were sweaty as I gripped the arm of the chair.  Stella patted my hand, "It'll be alright."

"It always is."  I said flatly.  "Give Aidan the magazine.  It should keep him quiet."

"He'll just eat it."  Stella said.

"No.  Trust me."

"I know my son."  I could hear the anger in her voice.

I shrugged.  "Fine."  I pulled my hand from under hears and put it in my lap and squeezed my knees instead.  I could feel the strength of my own grip and was thankful I didn't have the strength of the Venatori or I'd have bruises.

The flight attendants started their spiel and I couldn't pay attention to the words.  I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing.  This was worse than the elevators in the AU building back home.  It was a long drawn out process one I had to endure for hours.  I don't think I could actually make a flight over seas.

Stella fussed with her son over sitting still and squawking.  The plane started moving and my heart skipped a beat as I clutch my leg.  Landings and takeoffs were the worst parts.  Once the take off was complete I could zone into my headset and meditate and keep most of the anxiety at bay, but right now without the music as a distraction I was going to have issues.

A hand snuck across the chair arm and snagged the magazine.  I heard Stella, "Here.  Just stop, Aidan."  

I was too preoccuppied to notice what happened next.  The plane lifted off the ground and my stomach reeled.  I could feel it flipping inside.  I took a deep breath and held it until it hurt too much.  

Stella grabbed my hand and squeezed it and put it on the arm chair clasped under hers.  I looked over at her and notice Aidan was happily flipping through the magazine she'd taken from me.  I gave her a half smile and turned back towards the front and focused on my breathing, and not crushing Stella's delicate hand in mine. It was soft and warm.  I could smell the sweet scent of roses.  I turned my focus to the soft scent and the warmth of her hand, it helped to focus on something real - something in my control.  It was the basis of one of my anxiety rituals - five things I could see, four things I could touch, three things I could hear, two things I could smell and one thing I could taste.  

The idea of tasting pulled at more primal things inside me with a beautiful woman sitting next to me holding my hand.  I pushed away those thoughts Stella was far from my type.  Well not my type, but those I allowed myself to become involved with.  She was a mother, and likely had a significant other.  And if there wasn't, I'm not the type of guy who wants to get involved with someone who wants more than just sex.  I didn't do relationships.  I could see Margo rolling her eyes at me as I say the same thing to her.  I can feel the smack across the head from my now present father.  Don't treat women like that.  

Yet my father had more children with more woman than most Venatori.  He was a sought after sould apparently.  I was still trying to get over my past with my father.  I hated him for so many years for not being there for me.  And when I found out at my graduation from the Academy that he'd been around me my whole life.  I was pissed.  I'm still pissed.  Though Margo would remind me that I'm not angry at him.  He was a victim too.  He hadn't known about me until I knew about him.  I shouldn't blame him.

A call over the intercom brought me back to the present.  Stella squeezed my hand and I turned my attention back to her.  "You okay?" she asked.

I nodded.  "Yeah."  I squeezed her hand and pulled from of her warm grip.  "Thanks."

She smiled at me.  It was such a prett smile underneath those great green orbs.  "You should go get a drink of water."

I shook my head and pulled a bottle of water from the pocket in my cargo pants.  Stella laughed as I cracked the top and slugged back the water.

Aidan started squawking again.  I nodded, "His ears hurt."

Stella sighed and took out a sippy cup and handed it to him.  "How do you know what he wants?"

I shrugged, "Sixth sense I guess."  It was in reality.  It wasn't a gift like empathy, it was more reading body language, and understanding what the patterns around a person meant.  It was the first time that I'd actually let my mind see what it had been seeing around Aidan the whole time.  His aura, not really the psychic kind, I didn't see those, but the way the patterns moved around him I could see things I shouldn't see.  He couldn't be Venatori.  She wasn't, she was human, I could see that.  "Why are you going to New York City or is it just a stop through?"  I had a very bad feeling about this.

Stella smiled.  "Job interview."  She frowned and then looked out the window.  I didn't even want to think of what she saw but she smiled and turned back to me.  "I lost my job a month ago.  I can't seem to land another one, but my mom talked to Aidan's father who I didn't know she was talking to until recently and he's arranged for an interview in New York City at his company."

"A dead beat father?  I know that feeling."  I said without thinking.

Stella sighed, "It's not like that.  I didn't tell him.  The day I was going to tell him, he told me he didn't love me, couldn't love me and he had to go.  I forgot about what I wanted to tell him and I asked him why and he confided that he liked men."

"So you didn't tell him you were pregnant?"  I paled.  If Aidan was Minorem - half human half Venatori like he looked to be she could have died. Fuck!  She has no idea what danger she was in.  "When did he find out?"

"My mother contacted him when she found his phone number in my phone still after Aidan had been born and she was helping me out.  She called him and told him.  She said he was ready to get on a plane and wisk me away to New York but she talked him out of it.  But here I am using his so-called connections to try and get a job."  She looked out the window again. "Apparently he works at some school and is a big wig, and they are always looking for people with my skills to help with the office work."

"What company?" I asked to confirm.

"It's some subsidary of Apex Unlimited.  They are putting me up in Hotel Pennsylvania and I have an interview at their building."  She turned to me and sat up straight in her chair and asked, "You know anything about Apex Unlimited?"

"I work for them, in a round about sort of way.  A subsidary of a subsidary or something."

She asked, "Are they good to work for?"

I nodded.  "I've never wanted for anything since being with them."  Which was true.  The Venatori took care of their own.  They didn't pay well in human standards, but you were garunteed a place to live, three squares a day and all your needs tended too.  They paid you a measley stippened for your wants.  And I had been with them a long time.  I added, "The daycare system is excellent.  Provided housing is adequate.  Their cafeteria is acceptable but I prefer to cook myself."

"What do you do for them?"  Stella asked.

I didn't know if she knew anything about my world so I had to go with the half truth.  "I'm a secuirty consultant.  I travel around the country taking care of problems for them.  I'm flying back for a conference they are having this week because I have a unique view of some of the problems."

"Oh that sounds wonderful." 

I shrugged, "I suppose.  I'm a little afraid of talking in front of this crowd.  I'm not a shy person, but these people are the big wigs of everything and I'm just a little lowly field worker.  What do I know?"

Stella took my hand in hers and squeezed it.  "Apparently more than them if they asked you to speak."

I shrugged again.  Aidan crawled out of his seat and into his mama's lap and then  into mine with the magazine.  I grinned at her.  "Apparently we are talking too much."

Stella laughed softly.  "I'm sorry.  He seems to like you."

"Kids normally do."  I grinned at her.  "Something about the age difference."

She chuckled as I put my attention to the little lap stealer and his magazine.  For the next twenty minutes while drinks and snacks were passed around Aidan and I pointed and near naked women in ads and discussed the finer points of body parts.  It was entertaining to see a three year old exclaim boobies on the plane.  Stella covered her mouth in embarassement and I could only laugh.  He was going to be a breast man.

I siped at the water I'd brought with me and refused the refreshments they had provided.  Stella instead prompted me to get her a coke and she downed both of them.  I imagined that she was up late nights with her son.  Or worrying over what she was going to do with her life.

I asked.  "Do you intend to let his father into his life?"

Stella shrugged.  "I hadn't thought about it.  I suppose I should. I mean he has tried to take care of us, but I won't let him."

I nodded.  The man was at least honorable at that rate.  And it made me realize that maybe I needed to try harder with my own father.

Stella interrupted my train of thought.  "You go blank often, what's on your mind?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing.  Just reminded how similar this is to my own childhood."

"Oh?"

"My mother left me in the care of strangers when I was five.  My father didn't know I existed until I was 18.  I hated him for not being there as a child.  But it was my mother's choice to keep him out of my life even though she wasn't in it.  I was just thinking I should try harder with my own father.  It wasn't his fault."

Stella laughed.  "You are making this up to make me feel guilty."

I shook my head and stared down the aisle in front of me.  "No.  My mother spit at me and called me a monster and left me with people who could help me."

"That's horrible."  Stella sounded revolted by the thought.

I shrugged.  "Whatever."

"Have you talked to your mother since then?"  she asked.

"Twice.  Once when I was 18 when my father was introduced to me and the second time a few months later when she died."  My mother had been hunting a werebear and I was assigned the task to find it on my own and kill it.  It was part of my first hunt with my handler. My mother didn't want to give up the job so she came with us and insisted we do it her way.  So she was the first one in the werebear's cave and the first one attacked.  

She suffered massive injuries to her chest and I received a rake to the chest before I was able to kill it.  We rushed my mother to the Boulder Infirmary but she'd been bitten.  And the disease that makes a human a were creature tore my mother apart.  I watched her suffer through the window in the door because she refused my presence in her room.  I watched her die hating me.  

Stella tapped my arm.  "You did it again.  You okay?"

I nodded.  "Yeah, bad memories."

Stella squezed my arm, "I'm sorry for your loss."

I shrugged.  "I'm not."

"You can't hate your mother."

I nodded.  "I do.  She hated me.  Even in the end she hated me.  I watched her die from the other side of the door because she wouldn't let me in to her room."  I shook myself just as the seat belt light went on and we started our decent.  Just what I needed as we landed - more fucking anxiety.
