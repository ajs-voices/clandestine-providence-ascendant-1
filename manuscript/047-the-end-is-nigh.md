# Part III: Exiled

## The End is Nigh

I didn't sleep at all when my alarm went off and not because I'd spent half of it making love to Dorian.  Something I had never done with anyone - sex yes, and I'd had sex with Dorian before but this was different.  It felt different.  After I'd turned off my alarm I rolled back over and buried my face against Dorian's body.  I didn't want to leave him.  But I had things to do.

I kissed Dorian on the temple and whispered in Dorian's ear.  "I love you."  He nuzzled my cheek and I left his bedroom probably for the last time.  I started a pot of coffee and found a peice of paper and left Dorian a note.

> Dorian
>
> I'm sorry to leave while you are a still asleep but I can't bear to see you sad.  I love you with all my heart.  I have to do what he wants.  I can't let him hurt you.  I will try to let you know I'm okay.
>
> I love you.
>
> Always, Nox

I poured myself a cup of coffee in a disposal cup Dorian had apparently purchased recently as the package was unopened, and I looked around Dorian's apartment with sorrow and headed for the door.  

My heart was racing as I went to my not so empty apartment, everything I'd bought earlier in the week had finally arrived and things were cluttering up the living room - boxes, furniture.  I sighed.  Good glad the Venatori had to pay for it!  

I grabbed my two bags that I'd still not unpacked yet and slung them over my back and headed for the elevator.  I was used to living out of my bags, and I wasn't going to be completely homeless before I did this.

I hit the first ATM in the lobby and pulled all my money from my account and stuck it in the bottom of my backpack.  Then I took my things across the street.  I opened the door to the 24 hour diner and was greeted with a jubuliant "Howdy" from Bonnie.  She looked up and saw the sadness on my face3 and frowned.  

Before she could try to comfort me I spoke quickly.  "Can I keep some stuff here for a little while.  It might be a few days."

She nodded and headed for the back room.  "Is everything okay?"

I shook my head.  "No ma'am it's not but not something I can or want to talk about."

Bonnie put her hand on my shoulder, "Did he break up with you?"

I looked at her confused.  "What?  No.  Dorian is great.  My life just fucking sucks.  Look I gotta go.  Thanks for this."

I was back out the door and heading back into the AU building.  I glanced at my phone and went to the common area where I was supposed to be in a few hours.  I took a seat with my coffee where I knew Mark Green would walk in from.  

It felt like more than a few hours, my coffee had gone cold untouched.  My body ached from the strain as I sat pretending to read on my phone.  I had read the same page for nearly an hour when Mark Green's first bodyguard stepped inside the room and nodded that it was safe.  At least he assumed it was safe.  The moment that Mark Green stepped through the double doors I stood up and created a fireball bigger than I had ever created and I threw it at him.  I could only pray he knew what he was doing.

I watched as the fireball crashed around Mark Green and then an impossible pain shot threw my body as the backlash hit me.  I screamed out in pain and fell to my knees just as two guards pulled me up from the ground by my arms.

Mark Green walked casually up to me with a small smile.  "Didn't expect that did you?"  I didn't say anything.  "Remove the tattoo from his temple and throw him out with only the clothes on his back.  Let's see how the would-be assassin can survive without his precious Venatori providing for his very existance."

One of the guards who hadn't been there with Mark Green protested.  "He tried to kill you."

Mark Green laughed.  "You don't think I know that.  I don't think he'll be trying that again.  I'm sure he'll think twice before throwing powerful spells out at people he doesn't understand."  Mark started to leave but he turned back to me.  "Oh and make sure it's a public exiling - we don't want others like him to get any more ideas."

My body shook with the pain that was still searing through my veins as he laughed at me and walked away.  I wasn't taken to any guard room I was dragged to the middle of the Venatori Headquarters command center and I was strapped to a chair I recognized from my Ad Aetatam.  They intended to cover the tattoo at my temple with a disgraced mark.  

The pain from whatever Mark had done to me still coursed through me as the fear set in.  When Ash finally arrived with her tattoo station I was in a near panicked state.  I couldn't focus on anything.  I could hear voices all around me, I could hear their whispers.  On the balcony looking down at me I saw Dorian standing staring at me with pain in his eyes.  I didn't know what was running through his mind, but my eyes ever left his as I saw Ash sit down out of the corner of my eye.  

I felt a knife cut my arm as she took blood for the ritural that would cover the magical tattoo on my temple.  Blood for blood.  During your Ad Aetatem you weren't allowed to be weak, I had no dilusions about my fear but I refused to let the Venator see my weakness.  I stared up at the blue eyes of the man I loved and I bit my bottom lip as Ash went to work to cover the pair of crossed swords.  The mark of a disgraced Venantori was variation on the Chinese symbols for exiled.

This tattoo differed from one given during your Ad Aetatem, not only could it be seen by anyone with supernatural powers but so could normal ordinary people.  It was meant to make you stand out.

I wanted to cry out in pain as the needle peirced my skin repeatedly but I didn't I just stared at Dorian biting my bottom lip and before Ash was done I could taste the blood in my mouth.  As Ash cleaned the tattoo area the screens all flipped and Mark Green spoke to the entirty of the Venatori.

"This man here has been exiled for his attempt at murder.  I am lienant on him because he is only a pawn in the story.  Someone is coming after me and the boy here is only a casuality of this war.  He is no longer one of us.  He is weak and shall be despised by all.  Any who help him shall find a similar fate awaits them.  Nox Setanta I exile you to the mundane world for evermore."

A cheer went up and two guards pulled me from the chair and dragged me to the elevator and out threw me out into the public area of the AU building, but not before I felt a large hand slip something into my pocket.  I stumbled on to the tile floors outside the elevator and turned to watch the doors close and the sneers of rejoice coming from the guards being the last thing I'd see of the Venatori.

Fuck!

I turned and walked out of the building and just kept walking.  I was so screwed.  I knew doing this was going to get me exiled with no hope of ever returning to the Venatori even if Mark Green had a plan I was in the dark.  I couldn't fathom why he'd let me go after I had tried to kill him, or what the hell he'd done to cause the backlash.  I tried to replay the episode in my head as I walked, but I saw nothing I hadn't seen before.  What wouldn't I give to have a photographic memory like Dorian.  Dorian...

I felt so lost and I just kept walking until the sun set.  I didn't even know where I was until I looked up and found myself standing in front of the AU building.  I wondered if I'd just been walking circles without realizing it.  Or was this my brains way of telling me to get my things.  I walked across the street and did just that.

When I entered Bonnie started her normal greeting until she looked up and saw me.  "Oh my, what happened to you.  She touched the tattoo on my temple.  Why on earth does that look so angry."

"Punishment.  Can I get my things?"

"No you will eat.  You look horrible."  She guided me to my corner spot in the back of the diner and had me a water and pumpkin pie without even asking me what I wanted she was back in the kitchen and before I knew it my usual sat on the table before me.  I hadn't eaten anything all day and I devoured the food.

When I was done she had my things sitting on the opposite bench.  "I think I understand now why you wanted these here.  You did something you knew would get you in trouble."

I only nodded and she sat down on the bench with my bags.  "Why did you do it Nox?"

"I had to."  I whispered.  I reached across the table for my backpack and pulled out some of the money at the bottom of my bag and dropped the cost on the table.  "I have to go now.  Thank you."

She looked at the money and as I stood up she snatched it from the table and stuck it in my pocket.  I pulled the money out seeing the note that was placed there earliery today.  I just started walking as I stared at the note.  I put it back into my pocket with the money as the door jingled shut behind me.
