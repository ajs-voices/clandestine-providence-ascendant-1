# Morning Ritual

My night started as any other - darkness.  The darkness filled with a red eire glow as my demons approcahed in the depths of my mind.  I could feel the tension rising.  I felt the air around me thicken as I was pushed against the wall that had not been there before.  

A flicker of light like lightning outside a window but no thunder followed changed the scene.  The darkness was replaced with billowing smoke that made it hard to breathe.  Shadows moved in the smoke but I couldn't make anything out yet - but I knew what they were. 
Tentacles of earth, air, fire and water slipped and slide over the surface of the earth as the red glow formed into a set of eyes glowing in the smoke.  I would never fully see the figure that tormented my dreams though I knew who it was.  I have always known.  

One tentacle of air reached me and I flinched in the glow of it's aura.  I could see the pattern that made it whole and I froze on instinct.  It slashed at my shirt and it fell to the ground in shreads.  The bile and the fear rose in my stomach I wasn't sure what was worse the nausea or the fear - both a product of my anxiety and nightmares.  My heart raced inside my chest.  It felts like it was trying to escape.  I wish I could escape.

A voice echoed in my head.  "There is no escape."

There were tentacles all around me and when the first lashed out I felt my skin flay.  The second and the third went deeper and I felt my skin knitting back together but the onslaught of the demon's tentacles left my back a bloody mess.  The glowing eyes moved closer, and with all the elements at once one final strick broke my silence and I bit back my scream falling.  I never fell...

I landed on the floor between the coffee table and the couch I had made my bed.  My back ached and my lip felt swollen.  I rolled on to my back and I could feel the wounds healing even know.  I touched my lip with one hand and pulled away blood, but the ache was slowly disappearing from there as my body healed itself.  

My back was a bloody mess.  Which meant that couch and floor would now carry stains of my blood.  Fuck!  How was I going to explain this to Mia.

A groggy figure stood above me and I frowned.  Mia asked, "You okay?"

I shook my head.  "Nightmares."

Mia frowned.  "I heard."  A small ball of illumenscent light formed over Mia's hand as she looked at the couch.  "That'll come out.  Let me see."

I didn't move but Mia stepped around the coffee table and knelt down before me and lifted my shirt.  "It's mostly healed now.  Nox, what's going on?"

I shrugged.  "I'm home."

Mia grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me around violently.  I fell backwards trying to scramble away.  Mia lifted her hands away from me.  "I'm sorry.  Talk to me."

"The first night home is always the worst."  I said in a small voice which made me think of the first time it had happened.  I was so scared, in so much pain as my body healed itself from self inflicted wounds.  

"What's going on?"  Mia whispered as she started crawling towards me.  I didn't move, she wasn't adding to the terror coursing through my veins.  She wrapped her arms around me and held me tight.  I collapsed into her embrace like a small child.  Mia was careful not to touch my back.

"Don't worry about it.  I'll talk with Margo soon."

"Come to bed, Nox.  We'll keep you safe."  Mia stood up and offered me a hand.  I turned and took it without thinking.  It had been a long time since I'd shared their bed and even longer in a platonic fashion.

Mia lead me by the hand to her bedroom and opened the door quietly and we slipped inside.  Jace was lying near the side of their king side bed.  Mia walked over and shoved him over he grumbled but he moved.  "What?" he said groggily.

"Nox had a nightmare."

Jace's eyes popped open and he move to the middle of the bed.  Mia crawled over him and laid down and drapped her head on his shoulder.  "I shouldn't"  I said.  "I will only wake up again."

Jace tossed the edge of the covers over and patted the bed next to him.  "We'll keep you safe, Nox.  Come on."

I sighed.  It was a lie, there was no safety in my dreams.  But the gester was nice.  I laid down next to Jace and stared up at the ceiling before Jace was tugging at me to join them.  I laid down next to him and felt the familiar warmth of his body against mine.  When were were kids he often slept in my bed.  It was like a comforting blanket I had forgotten.  Jace rolled on to his side away from me and I curled up against the length of his body and he Mia's.  My hand drapped over his hip and I felt Mia's underneath my hand.  I moved it aside but she grabbed it and pulled it over both of them.  She held my hand and I drifted off into the blackness again with ease.

The darkness wrapped itself around me.  A chaos of patterns bloomed in my vision.  Reds and greens shifted in swirls of Christmas vomit as the yellows and blue made horrid shades of green as they mixed and mingled.  Patterns became abstract like I was living in a world made by Picaso.  Fires started in every creavice of my mind.  Little children danced in bonnets and bayonets.  One flaying the other before there was nothing but puddles of blood sifting through the kalidescope of colors.

And then it was black again.  The shifting colors were there covered in darkness.  Things would bump against my extremedies.  The cool breeze blew against my skin and it felt plesant until it became ice cold and my skin froze in ribbons. 

The fires from before burned through the darkness until I saw nothing but the flickering flames and I felt their red hot heat through my dreams.  I could feel the sweat beading on my brow.  I wipes my hands across my forehead and they came back blood red.  I was too distracted by the red on my hands to notice the red eyes coming near and when I looked up I saw my nightmare face to face.  His eyes were no longer red and glowing but the amber brown I remember them to be.  He smiled down at me like days of old.  I tried to get away.  

I started awake as my shoulder fell.  My heart was racing.  And my shoulder ached from the fall to the floor but I didn't bother getting up.  Jace was looking over the edge, "You wouldn't wake up."

"Sorry." I stayed flat on the floor while Jace climbed to the other side of the bed and started getting ready.  I could hear his movements towards the shower without another word. 

Mia whispered, "Will he be alright?  Why don't you go help him?"

Jace gave her a quiet laugh.  "He doesn't want my help.  He never does.  Just leave him be, he'll get up once the panic has been righted.  Trust me, I know Nox."

Mia sighed, and in a raised voice meant for me, "You got breakfast still?"

I took a deep breath and sat up.  "Yeah I got it." 

I was up and moving out the door when Mia shook her head, "You might want to change your shirt first."

I took it off and turned it around it was covered in slashes of blood.  "I'm sorry about that."

She handed me one of Jaces from the nearby closet.  "No problem.  It wasn't your fault."

They at least beleived me to a degree.  What I would tell them anyway.  Neither of them were happy I never told them exactly what was going on.  But I couldn't bring myself to say it much less say it outloud.

I pulled the shirt over my head and went into Mia's kitchen.  If one thing was for sure Mia had a great kitchen.  She had a grill right in the middle and I would have loved to cook a steak on it, but that wasn't on the menu for today.
