## Trouble Brewing

Elena and I chatted through the rest of dinner, though I think most of it was flirting and not so much informative.  She seemed confident that I was going to fit in perfectly.  I wasn't exactly so sure about that.  Like the dinner with Asher she ordered desert - strawberry cheesecake.

I wasn't a big sweets person, but I ate it anyway.  I could be picky when I was actually feeding myself again.  Tonight I ate too much, I would probably be sick afterwards particularly since I used the gym which I hadn't touched in more than six weeks.  I was not impressed with myself.  I had work to do.

But at least things were looking up.  Back at my room Elena stood closer to me than was necessary, the little red dress she was wearing clung to her curvy body and I could see the faces of other men as they walked past us.  And the dirty looks from the women who thought it was inappropriate.  Her raven hair fell over her shoulders and covered most of her back that was exposed.  Long legs in red high heels.  I wanted to touch her.  I could feel the want inside me - the desire to take her with me into my room.

She carressed my neck and leaned against me pretending to be a little tipsy.  I knew better the wine bottle at our table remained full except for the two initial cups we had been poured at the beginning of dinner which were still both half full when we left.  It was amazing finding a woman who played the same tricks I did.

I leaned down and kissed her softly.  "I'm tired Elena.  Good-night."

She pouted as I used the key behind my back and opened the door to escape her fingers on my neck.  Her voice was low and breathy when she said Good night.  

She was trying hard - too hard.

I pulled off all the new clothes and folded them neatly on the other bed and curled up in nothing but my boxers in the luxurious sheets, there was only one thing missing.  I thought about calling Dorian.  But a text landed on my screen from Ant.  [i]May I?[/i]

I flipped off all the lights in the room and closed the curtains in the window before crawling back in bed to answer the text.  [i]Sure.[/i]

And in the few seconds it took the message to send, a woman wearing all black and a sword at her side was standing in the doorway of the closet - the darkest shadow in the room.  I had expected Ant, not his mother.

I sat up and she gave me a wry glance before taking a step closer.  "Your things were delevired this morning to the address requested."

"You could have sent that in the text."

She smiled.  "Yes, but it is not why I'm here."  She didn't wait for me to say anything as she continued.  "Ant said if you were to contact me to give you this in person."  She sighed, "He stressed the in person.  It was important."

I took the paper from her and our fingers touched, her skin was ice cold.  She was truly an undead vampire, at least Ant and Marco were warm to the touch.  She cocked her head to the side.  "What is bothering you?"

I shook my head. "Nothing, you are just cold.  I'm not exactly overly physical with the embraced."

She smiled, and it frightened me.  I could feel the pulse rise in my neck as my heart raced.  "I frighten you?"

"You are Il Cane.  Of course the fuck you frighten me."

The smile grew wider and she nodded. "And you are Nox Setanta - fearless."

"Ha! I'm afraid of a great many things.  But I don't let my fear rule me."

"Read it."  She commanded.

I blinked at her and she nodded at the paper in my hand.  It was a note written in Dorian's glorious hand writing.  I smiled as I started to read it.

> My love,
>
> I miss seeing you but I understand.  This is not a personal note however.  Our fathers plan to ambush the vampires you have set up a meeting with.  I have told Ant and he thanked me for the information and wished me the best of luck in the upcoming war.  If our father's do this, Nox, the will be a war.  If you are anywhere in any place that you can help, you must.  I don't think the world will survive if the Vampires break the Providence.
>
> Again.  I miss you.  I love you - Always, Dorian

My heart sank when I read it.  I looked up at Cari Giovanni who sat on the edge of the other bed.  "When is the meeting?" I asked.

She frowned, "I am unware of it.  Ant has not told me and Ryan is keeping quiet.  Bernstein doesn't like when I come here.  I throw off his carefully placed balancing act.  And Marco refuses to speak to me."

"Why would he refuse?" I was genuinely curious as I pulled the pillow closer to me.  I didn't like being exposed to the most powerful vampire in the world.  To every supernatural race Il Cane is the one thing that bumps back against the things that go bump in the night.  Dragons fear her and they can flame throw her so easily.

She rolled her eyes, "Because I will not allow him in my bed."

I laughed.  "If it's important he'll tell you.  Nevermind he'll tell me."  

I typed in Marco's number and texted him. [i]When are you meeting my father? and where[/i]

There was an immediate shimmer in the shadows and Marco appeared.  He was pouting when I looked over at him.  "You are with her."  He pointed at the hound sitting on the other bed.

"Answer my question Marco."

He crossed his arms over his bare chest and shook his head.  "Do you wish to ever find yourself in **my** bed?"

He pouted.  "Not that you plan to share yourself anymore - anyway.  But ..."  He relaxed his entire body giving up the whole charade.  "I suppose if there is ever a chance I cannot be denied it.  Your father plans to ambush at your and Ant's favorite meeting spot.  Plenty of hiding places and at an hour where there are few citizens of our fair city."  He took the paper Dorian's note was on and wrote down the time and place.  "Just in case you forgot."

There was a knock on my door.  "Nox?"

I waved the vampires away.  "Elena?  One second."

Cari vanished into thin air before even stepping into the darkened shadows.  It showed her power.  Marco frowned.  "Show off," he whispered.  He kissed my cheek softly, "You were missed."  And then he was gone.

I hated vampire politics but the CCB wasn't exactly looking to play nice either if they were the ones behind the assassination attempts on Mark's person.

I unfurled from the blankets and opened the door for Elena.  She was still wearing the little red dress but had removed her shoes.  Behind her stood a little brunette and I smiled at her.  "I have brought company.  Sheridan sends his reguards, however he is currently a little tied up at the moment."

I raised my eyebrow at the reference, Adrian was a lot of things but he was not a submissive.  "I do hope it's of his own free will."

"Yes, darling.  It is part of our deal."

"Your deal?"

She smiled.  "You can have your darling wolf, and I have him for the night."

"Leah agreed to this?"

"What the little wife doesn't know."  Elena said as she wandered off to her room. 

I whispered, "She'll smell you all over him."

Elena laughed, "I hope so darling."

I waved Jo in.  She hadn't taken her eyes off of me.  I was in my boxers.  As she passed by me she ran her fingers over the scar on my chest.  It sent a shiver down my spine but not in the way it had with Elena.  It was different - the energy was different.  She didn't get far inside as she wrapped her arms around me and pressed her check into my chest.  

I wrapped my arms around her and closed the door.  I could smell the forest on her stronger than usual. "I need to sleep."

Jo took off her shoes and jeans and crawled into next to me and curled up against my body.  It felt good to hold her.  My thoughts drifted to Dorian as I fell asleep.
