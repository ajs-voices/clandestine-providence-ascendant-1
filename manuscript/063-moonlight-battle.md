## Moonlight Battle

I walked out of the locker room and everyone gave me a wide bearth as I headed for the door.  Raf and Jo followed at my heels.  It was like having two little love sick puppies.  But I was glad for the company.  

Once we were away from the gym I said what was on my mind.  "Paul is thinking about challenging me?"

Raf stopped dead in his track and when I stopped and turned around to look at him he was cowering.  "I'm sorry."

"It's not your fault.  Don't worry about it.  James says I have to challenge him, protect what is mine."

Raf nodded but he stayed a pace or two behind me.  I held out my hand and he took it and I dragged him even with me.  "I have to kill him?"

Raf nodded again wanting to hang back.  "And if I don't we all get thrown out.  James' decrees will stand."  I didn't need Raf to nodd to understand that it meant that they would have to come with me.  I wouldn't be supporting just myself, but my small pack.  

Jo added.  "If you don't challenge him, or he you, I imagine James will take care of it.  Even Adrian listens when James Wright tells him to do something."

I sighed, "I go from one home to the next and I'm expected to kill here too."

Raf lifted my hand to his heart.  "It is the way of the wolf.  Only the strongest survive.  You look weak because you can't shift.  You can't hold us in our natural states."

"I didn't even know you could do that.  I didn't know **I** could do that."

Raf smiled.  "You are so young yet so powerful.  Tonight is the full moon.  I want to watch with my human eyes as you defeat Paul.  Hold us tonight, Nox.  You have the power, just try."

I sighed.  "Fine.  How do I challenge him?"

Raf laughed.  "Nothing formal.  Paul Shaffer I challenge you for leadership of your pack.  That should do it."

Jo put her hand on my shoulder and we finished walking back home.  Emily looked at me with sorrow.  I frowned, "You heard?"

She nodded.  "I'd ask you not to, but James is the leader.  And disobedience is tolerated even less than Alpha disputes." She put her hand on my shoulder, "Good luck, Nox.  May the moon give you the power you seek tonight."

"And you Emily.  I'm sorry."

She gave me a weak smile.  "Nothing to apologize for Nox.  Nothing at all, it is the way of life."

I had already started dinner by the time people started arriving.  When James said the clan he meant the clan.  There were people with whom I had never seen before entering the house and taking seats.  I could feel the moon rising and I went into the pack bedroom with Jo and Raf and we sat in solitude while I found the power inside me to keep them human for the duration of the night.  

At first it was a struggle just to keep that focus and then once it clicked, once I felt the forest coursing through my veins I felt them and knew that I didn't need to maintain the vigil to keep them from changing.

It was a new experience.  When I walked out there were more people waiting around and eating  I hadn't had anything to eat yet.  I saw Paul out of the corner of my eye and he was edging past a crowd of people and I decided it was now or never.  Raf and Jo patted my back as I left them, they could feel my nerves.

I followed Paul into the game room where James happened to be talking to a very large man with long curly hair and ice blue eyes.  Elena was standing next to him, wrapped in arms.  That had to be Charles.  James nodded at Paul to turn around and I saw him go white.  I sighed.  He'd heard too.  

I wasn't shy but I stepped up next to Paul and spoke clearly if not overly loud.  "Paul Shaffer I challenge you for leadership of your pack."

I saw James smile from behind his glass of beer.  I heard the normal taunts from around the room, "Pretty boy's got balls."  "This should be easy, Paul's got him by shear muscle alone."  But I heard one voice stand out among the crowd, Elena laughed, "You haven't seen the pretty boy fight yet, have you."  She was mocking them and it made me smile.

James stepped up.  "Paul?"

"Accpeted."  He said flatly. His eyes were wide and his pulse was racing.  I could almost taste his fear.  That was a new feeling.

James smiled.  "Paul lead the way to the pack room, it is your house."

There were cheers and jeers coming from either side of the room when we were down stairs in a dark dank basement and I thought to myself I wish I'd known it was here, it was wet enough I could throw fireballs without leaving damage.

Paul stood at one end of the ring already.  The ring consisted of a red circle drawn on the cement.  I looked at James, "Other than to the death are there any other rules?"

James shook his head.  "No rules at all."

I nodded.  I wasn't going to clarify enough to say that I couldn't use my Magnus ability it was the only way I was going to win after all.  

I could feel the power of Raf and Jo pulsing through me.  I felt their heat, and their hunger coursing through my veins.  I could smell the sweat and the fear from my opponent.  I smelt the forest eminating from him, but it was weak compared to what I had around me.  I could smell Raf and Jo and nothing else.  

Paul snarled at me and I could see the wolf teeth in his mouth and the claws on his fingers.  He lunged at me and I side stepped him quickly.

I felt the power of the forest humming around me.  Not around me - in me.  It flared each time Paul came close and tried to rake me with his hands.  He snapped and growled and tried to intimidate me before he lunged and I caught him by the arms and held him away from me.  It wasn't easy he was stronger than I was.  I used his weight and his momentum to tumble us both to the floor and before he could right himself I had my hands and a weave of air around his head and I twisted hard and I heard the distinct snap of his neck.

I stood up and let the body fall off of me as I did.  There was a sudden surge of energy around me as those who were loyal to Paul knelt and their magic joined Raf's and Jo's.  I could feel Emily and Michael upstairs, and all those who knelt on the floor in the pack room.  James was glaring at a few who had not knelt.  There magic hung in the air.

I stepped between them and James and looked at him with a smile.  "Kneel or be knelt."

James smiled at me and I turned to the scragglers, only one still stood by the time I had returned their direction.  

The man stepped forward and yelled, "I challenge you."

I smiled.  "Accepted."
 
I started for my place on the circle but the man lunged forward with my back turned to him and I closed my eyes and wove a circle of air that he dove through and yanked at his neck and hung him before everyone else to see.  His neck snapped with the forcefullness of my weave and he hung limply before everyones eyes suspened by nothing.  

The eyes of my pack lowered and their heads bent further towards the floor.

James laughed.  "Not what I was expecting.  Are there anymore challenges?"  No one answered.  "Bury Paul honorably, Bret can rot with the fish."

James clapped his arm around me and lead me up the stairs.  "And none of your followers changed when they lost Paul's connection.  You have impressed me young one."  He sat me down at the bar where Emily was crying softly into Michael's arms.  "Emily, your husband died honorably.  There is nothing to cry over.  Feed your Alpha I'm sure he's starving."

"Yes, James."
