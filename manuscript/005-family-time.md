# Family Time

I dropped my gear off in my crap room.  It was a simple studio apartment layout with a small kitchenette, with two person table, a tv on the wall and a queen sized bed.  Everything in the room was beige - the most boring color in the world.  I had called Jace and he said he'd meet me here.  He wanted to know what happened, but I didn't want to talk about it. 

There was a knock on the door and I quickly answered it with my duffle bag and carryon from the plane in my hand.  It wasn't Jace.  It was a pretty little brunette with little red gem in the center of her head - one of our Indian natives it appeared.  Like humans the Venatori tended to pick up nationalities and heritages akin to the humans.  There was only one Indian family that I knew of which meant that this little fox was a Dowager.

"How can I help you Ms. Dowager?"  I asked.

"Oh, you know who I am?" she asked.

I shook my head.  "No, ma'am, just a guess."

"Oh.  Well I was told you were coming to town.  I have a proposal for you.  If we can talk in private."  

She was very confident I would say yes so I stood in the door way and said, "I've been back a few hours and already getting hit up with offers of breeding?"

She blushed.  "I'm sorry, but I wanted to be the first."

I sighed then stepped aside.  Come on in."

I dropped my bags at the door as she sat down at the table delicately.  I searched in my cupboards for glasses and found two and poured two glasses of ice water from the fridge and set one down in front of Ms. Dowager.  "I'd offer you something else but I just got in."

"Where you going somewhere?"  she asked nodding to my things.

"To my best friends place for a home cooked meal and some family time."  There was no reason to lie to her.
