## Overheard Quarrels

I was left alone in the kitchen with my meal.  Michael took Emily upstairs to her bedroom.  Celia was sitting in the living room playing with her dolls.  I heard her start crying and my heart sank.  I took my plate and sat down next to her.  She looked up at me with her blonde babie doll and another one I didn't know her name.  I know Celia probaly told me before, they were her favorites.  

I sat eating my food and she leaned against me and cried.  I put my arm around her and her tears fell harder and faster.  But she never asked me why I'd done what I had, or why her Daddy had to die.  I was thankful because I didn't really have a good answer.  It wasn't my survival.  It was the two that I supported, and now I not only supported them, but everyone else who was tied to me through the magical bonds of whatever it was.  

I finished my dinner and put the plate on the coffee table and lifted Celia up into my arms and held her against my body.  It wasn't long before Michael had joined me and was curled up on my lap fighting tears.  He was 18 and turned earlier than most young werewolves.

I heard crying in the corner under the stairs and I shifted Michael to sit up and he scotted to the edge of the couch and put his head against the arm and watched me as I carried his little sister with me to kneel at the opening in the stair well storage.  A little boy cried.  "You okay?"  I asked.

He looked at me with large brown eyes, tears running down his cheek.  He snuffled as he spoke, "My daddy died today."

"I'm sorry."  I held out my hand.  "You want to come sit with us?  Celia and Michael's dad died today too."

He nodded his head and took my hand and I led him back to the couch and he settled in against my side and Michael curled up again in my lap.

I sat there with three sad children and the pack nodded their acceptance as they left the house to return to their own residences. Some went up stairs to their rooms but most left.  Elena sat down in the recliner chair and smiled at me as I held the kids who'd lost their father's today.  She looked proud of me.  She whispered, "Tomorrow you need to wear silver and gold in your hair."

I smiled, "Yes ma'am."

"No more ma'am Nox.  You have a much higher place than I do now.  Elena is fine."

"Okay, Elena it is."

She smiled at me again, "I'm proud of you.  I was worried that your attempt on Mark Green might have dulled your senses for the right thing.  Paul was a good man, but he was weak.  The pack needs strength to survive."

I sighed.  "I have no idea what I'm doing Elena."

"I will help you."  Elena leaned back and closed her eyes.

I could hear people talking in the kitchen, they were speaking in hushed tones I could barely hear.  But I heard my name being spoken louder than the rest.  I concentrated on the conversation.  I hated eavesdropping but this was about me.

"James, he's just a kid, and he's not even a werewolf.  He can't be a pack leader."  I didn't recognize the voice.

"Nox, is Venatori, or at least half.  He is capable of this job Charles.  If you doubt my judgement why didn't you challenge him."

Charles snorted, "He cheated."

"How do you figure?" James asked.

"He used his magic.  You saw how he just hung Bret like that."

James laughed softly.  "Bret was a fool, he tried to jump him while he had his back to him.  The boy hunted us for a living before he got here.  He knows what he's doing.  He knows things Charlie.  He can help I know it.  And not because Garrett says so, because I've seen it.  He personally knows the son of Il Cane.  I'd bet he'd be able to get in touch with Il Cane herself if we asked him to."

"We don't need vampire help."

"Of course we don't, but it's the principle of the matter.  He knows his way around the AU building.  We can pump him for information.  The plan still stands.  He doesn't like the Venatori anymore than we do.  And even if he did, we won't tell him the whole plan."

Charles lowered his voice further, "I still think just blowing up the building would be faster to rid us of their foul tempers.  They are starting wars with the vampires, if that little boy hadn't stepped in the world would be on fire right now."

James laughed, "All the more reason to keep the boy close."

Charles and James walked out of the kitchen with James' arm around Charles' shoulder.  Charles left his friend and took Elena by the hand.  "Are you ready beautiful?"

Elena beamed up at him with her eyes still closed.  "Yes, Darling."  She stood with Charles' help and smiled at me.  "Tomorrow I will give you a run down of your responsiblities as Alpha of a pack this large."

I nodded.  "Thank you Elena."

James nodded.  "In the mean time, tend to those who feel the pain the most."

He glanced down at the kids in my arms.  "It seems Elena has already started you on the right path."

Elena laughed.  "He did that himself, James.  He was already holding them when I came to sit down."

James put his hand on my shoulder and squeezed.  "I knew I was right."

The three of them left and Raf and Jo came into the living room and each of them took one of the little ones.  "We'll help get them ready for bed.  You go check on Emily."

I nodded.  I put my hand Michael's shoulder, "Sleep in the pack bedroom, I'll be down in a bit."  He smiled and nodded then headed to his own bedroom to change.

I found myself standing outside of Emily's door knocking softly.  Raf passed me with Celia in his arms and just turned the knob, "You are Alpha."

I sighed, but I walked in.  I found Emily lying on her bed with a knife from the kitchen contimplating slitting her wrists.  I sat down on the end of the bed and stared at the clothes hanging on the back of the door.  I spoke in a near whisper.  "I've been there before.  When I was eight.  I slit my wrists.  I hated being me then.  I was small, human and I was nothing special.  The only thing I accomplished with my suicide attempt was a stigma that I would kill myself at the drop of a hat and a very bloody bed that didn't get replaced for several years."

Emily had moved closer, the knife still in her hand.  "How did you get through it?"

"I had help.  My best friend had found me, I was mostly healed by the time he'd come in, but he called for help and I was taken to the Infirmary.  Then Margo, my therapist of two years at that point, helped me find the good in life, taught me to conquer my fears.  Fear is what made me do what I did.  Fear of the unknown.  Fear I'd fail miserbly.  I was afraid of everything.  My mother had done a number on me and I was still and am still dealing with residual feelings."

"You've not been seeing a therapist since you got here, you seem well adjusted."

I laughed.  "I'm a good actor.  Last night Raf and Jo slept in my bed comforting me.  If you hadn't noticed I sleep down there more often than not.  Being alone hurts, and now more so."

Emily put her hand on my leg slowly and I pulled her close, she curled against me like the kids had done.  "I'm not that strong.  Adrian has been listening to me and you and Elena have helped a great deal."

We sat in silence for a while.  "If you let me I can help you through this.  I can't replace your husband, and I don't want to.  But we can get through this together - that's what pack is right?  Family."

She sat up and kissed my cheek.  "Yes.  I will be right down, I think we will all be in the pack bed tonight."  Emiily handed me the knife.  "Thank you Nox."

"Anytime Emily."

I had too much on my mind to really think about what I overheard.   All these knew presenses in my head were distracting.  But for the first time without Dorian the others in my mind kept the nightmares at bay.  At least my usual ones.  I still had nightmares, or someone did, I wasn't sure if they were mine or not.
