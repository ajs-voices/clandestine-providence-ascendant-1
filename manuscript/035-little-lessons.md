## Little Lessons

I went back to my empty apartment and rolled out my sleeping bag in what would constitute my bedroom when I actually got a bed installed.  At least it was clean now and I wasn't sceeving out over that fact.  I lay staring at the ceiling counting the stains.  They looked like someone flipped embers at them.  I was going to have to redecorate and that did not sound fun.  

I eventurally drifted to sleep with the knowledge that I could smell Dorian all over my shirt.  My dreams eventually woke me up.  I sat bolt upright with the sun streaming through the window in my bedroom I hadn't even realized I had.  I found my phone buzzing silently as I missed my alarm.  I could still feel the nightmare as it fled my system, but the memory was lighter and softer than usual.  My pulse was still in my throat and my body covered in sweat.  

I got up and made breakfast, or what constituted breakfast from the microwave.  But I ate it anyway as much as I hated it.

I made my way to my new job.  I wore jeans and the same button up shirt I wore last night with Dorian.  It still smelled like him, but a lot like me too, it was disapointing really.  I was begining to think I was crazy the way I kept thinking about Dorian.  He was never far from my thoughts.

I walked into my classroom and there was a woman sitting in a small chair organizing some crafting supplies at the table.  "Hi."  I interrupted her organizing.  "I'm Nox.  Dae'lin told me to report here to teach some kids?"  I didn't sound overly convinced I should be here and I wasn't.

She stood up.  "My name is Helen and you are correct.  I am your assitant and the primary caretaker of the children.  You can set your own schedule to teach the children and your own lessons.  You can spend 4 hours a day teaching them out of eight."

I smiled as I offerd the small brunette my hand, "A pleasure.  Today I'll keep it simple.  I know one of them has sparked already and the others if I'm correct are all showing signs?"

"That is what they tell me, I'm just a child care provider."  She took my hand and I brought it to my lips and kissed the middle knuckle softly.

The first parent walked in as I was dropping Helen's hand to her side.  A small boy with black hair and eyes walked in holding on to his father's leg.  The dad said, "Go sit down Henry."  He looked up at me as he was trying to pry his son from his leg.  He offered me his hand.  "Eric Eskridge."

"Nox Sétanta.  I remember you from the Academy."  I took his hand.  "Your father is on the council."  

"Everyone seems to remember that."  

I grinned.  "So is mine."

"Kai Viddens right?"  Eric asked.

"Yep."  I knelt down to the small boy still clinging to his father's leg.  "Hey there Henry.  Why don't you come and sit down and we'll play a game. I'm sure your Dad has to get to work."  I formed a ball of fire above my hands.  "Think you can do this with me?"

Henry's eyes grew wider as he saw and I formed a second one slowly for him.  "Come on.  Let's try."

Henry came and held out both of his hands and I saw the small patterns forming above his hands and a small fire ball floated before he blinked and then it was gone.  I heard Eric's gasp.  He knelt down next to his son and patted his head.  "That was awesome little buddy.  Why don't you stay here with Mr. Nox and he'll teach you how to do more."

Hery nodded emphatically and I offfered him my hand and he took it quickly.  "I'll take care of him."

He whispered above his son's head as we stood up.  "We've been afraid he'll spark."

I smiled.  "After today he won't spark.  I promise.  My goal today is to make them safer and knowledgeable of what they can do.  They aren't too young to learn.  They just need a juvinail mind to show them the path."

Eric chuckled.  "I heard that about you."

I smiled and ran my fingers through my hair.  "At least you've heard of me."

"That's not exactly the quote."

I laughed.  "I know.  You are the worst pirate I have ever heard of.  But you've heard of me."  I smiled.  "Jack is awesome."

Eric laughed.  "I will see you later little man." And he left just as the twins walked in with their mother.

I knelt down in front of them.  "Hey.  I'm Nox.  What's your name?"  I signed the question, it was about all I could manage to learn last night while I tried to fall asleep.

The little girl giggled.  "I'm Rhiana and this is Joey."  

"It's a pleasure to meet you both.  You are going to have to help me understand your brother alright? That's all the sign language I know right now."

Helen stepped closer.  "I can help as well Nox.  I am an expert in languages, which is why I'm here in the first place."

"Excellent.  You can teach me.  I teach them and we'll all be happy."

"Rhiana and Joey why don't you take Henry and go play for a little while while we waite on the rest of your class."

Their mother shoved them off in the direction of the toys and Henry went along giggling with them.  She smiled at me.  "Janice."

I nodded and offered her my hand which she took and I lifted it to kiss as usual.  "Nox.  A pleasure."

"Don't borther Mr. Sétanta.  I know exactly what you are."

I smiled.  "And that means what exactly?  Know I'm Cesari, Minorem?"

"Gay."  She said flatly.

"I'm not gay.  I'm bi if you must put a label on it.  I like men.  I like women.  But what does that have to do with me paying my respects to a beautiful woman?"

Janice rolled her eyes.  "I'm not comfortable with you teaching my children.  And I will be speaking with the Academy head master to remove you from this position of impressionalbe young minds."

I sighed.  "So I'm going to teach them to be gay is that it?"

Helen stepped in and guided Janice out of the room I heard her say, "I will watch the children."  But she didn't indicate she'd watch me.  I wasn't sure if that was good or bad.  I truly didn't want to have to speak to this woman again and her homophobic views on life.

Helen came back and smiled at me.  "I'm sorry.  I should have warned you about Mrs. James-Burnett.  She's been against you since we found out about your appointment.  She has been lobbying fairly hard to get that overturned."

I shrugged.  "No big deal.  I deal with it everyday."

Helen reached up and pulled a blue lock of hair from the top of my head and settled in on my forehead.  "I'm sure this has nothing to do with it."

I laughed.  "Sorry.  My boyfriend likes it."

"Your boyfriend?  And you still flirt with everyone."

I nodded.  "My boyfriend and yes I will flirt unless he says otherwise."  

Stella arrived in a huff.  "I'm sorry I'm late.  Aidan go play."  She looked at me.  "Nox.  Thank you for last night.  I'm sorry for being rude."

I shrugged.   "No worries, Stella.  Just glad to help."

She hugged me.  "I'm sorry about your past too."

"Nothing to worry yourself over.  I'm over it."  I lied with a smile on my face.  I knew I wasn't over it, I still dreamt about it.

"I have to get to class."  Stella turned to Aidan. "You be good baby."

He didn't pay attention to her as he was busy playing with her friends.  Stella turned to Helen, "My boyfriend will be here to pick Aidan up."  My eyes were open wide as I wasn't aware she had a boyfriend.  Helen nodded and Stella was out the door.

"You are friends with Ms. Row?"

I nodded, "She's my boyfriend's ex and Aidan's father."

"Oh."  Helen's eyes were wide in shock as a little boy with ebony skin and golden hair and orange eyes.  I knew that face.  I cried for that face.  He skidded to a halt three feet from Helen and I and she smiled at him.  "Drake, this is Nox.  He's going to teach us."

I knelt down to his level and offered him my hand.  "Hi."  I said.  "I remember you.  I carried you once upon a time."  

He took my hand and brought it to his nose and sniffed my skin.  I grinned at him, knowing that I'd done the same on occassion when I was young seeking comfort in people who I'd met.  He hugged me quickly and tightly before he was off playing with his friends.  I watched as the five of them played with the toys.  Helen smiled.  "That's a better reaction than I got.  He doesn't speak much.  His ancestry has hindered his adoption.  Being a dragon scares most parents."

I nodded.  "Shall we start class?"  I stood up and moved to the circle on the floor.  "Hey guys, can ya come join me here.  I want to show you some things.  And then I want you to show me a few things."  They all put away the toys like old hat then came to sit on the circluar rug in their own colored pie areas and looked at me expectantly.  Helen sat off to one side so Joey could see her.  I was going to have to learn sign laugnage if I was going to do this for any long period of time.  I didn't like being unable to communicate with someone.

"I'm Nox.  I'm gonna be your teacher for a while.  I'm a Cesari."

Aidan raised his hand. "What's a Cesari?"

"A Cesari is a Magnus who can bend all four elements.  Which means that I can do magic."  I smiled at them, "Which means all of you can do magic too."  To emphasize my point I created four orbs - one for each element.  They floated above my hands and I saw Henry's glee as he held his hands in front of him and a flicker and a flash latter he had a small floating orb of fire.

The other kids all looked at Henry in awe and were sitting in front of him asking all sorts of question to which he answered, "Nox showed me how."

"If you all sit down and pay attention I'll show you slowly."  They listened and I showed then slowly how to make an orb of fire.  All five could bend fire.  All five could bend all four elements but they wouldn't likely have tested that way.

And sooner rather than later there were five orbs of fire sitting on their hands.  Even Drake had one.  His was larger and brighter than the others, but that was to be expected of a dragon.  One of the original Magnus in blood.  

We worked on creating each element and then we went through some protection techniques in the forms of a game.  It was meant to keep them safe from them self.  By the end of our four hours together they were begging for me to stay, but I had to go and they were more than equipped after this one lesson they weren't going to spark and harm someone.  

All the kids except Drake had lunch dates with their parents.  But when I saw who walked in for Aidan I froze.  The dark brown eyes that stared back at me with that slime smile froze my blood.  Aidan ran up and hugged Garrett's legs.  "Hi, Garrett.  This is my teacher, Nox."

He patted Aidan's back, "I know.  I taught Nox when he was your age."

Aidan looked up at Garrett with big blue eyes just like his father's.  "You taught Nox?  Can you teach me?"

My blood ran cold at those words, and my heart speed up to a painful pace.  I cluthced at my heart as Garrett smiled at me. "I'm sure I can show you a thing or two."  Garrett winked at me, "Come on Aidan let's go to lunch."

I watched as Aidan left with Garrett holding his hand and I stood frozen in terror.  Aidan...

Garrett turned around and smiled at me.  "You must come to dinner.  You and I have a few things to discuss, bring a bottle of wine.  And leave your precious little boyfriend at home.  Just the family and you, or things might get messy."
