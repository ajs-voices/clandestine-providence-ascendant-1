## Dinner with Dorian

We took the stairs.  I stopped on the landing where my new room was and opened the door for Dorian.  I grinned at him.  "I can open doors for you too."

He winked at me and made me walk through before him, one hand on the door the other at my waist.  "I like treating you Nox."

I smiled.  "Stay the night?"

Dorian didn't say anything as we walked to my door and I had unlocked it.  Dorian smiled at me then said, "I have a few things to do.  Dinner?  And then we'll see where it goes?"

I nodded with my back to my new door.  "I'll cook for you."  I turned and opened my door and found that even in the dim light from the hall my apartment was completely empty and I sighed.  I turned around and Dorian was watching me.  I grinned. "It's empty.  Your place then? I'll cook."

Dorian nodded. "That sounds good."  He pinned me against the door jam and kissed me.  I felt every nerve in my body ignite and Dorian leaned into me.  A small moan escaped from my lips and Dorian chuckled between kisses.  Dorian pulled away a little.  "7pm."

I kissed him softly and nodded.  "7."

Dorian pulled away completly and walked down the hall to do whatever he had to do.  I went into my room with my things and the folders and flipped on the lights.  But they didn't work.  There was a bit of work to do on this place and I wasn't really in the mood, so I changed into running clothes and went for a run.

My run started out uneventful, but as I started back into the AU building I had a strang feeling I was being followed.  I turned and looked around but I saw nothing out of the ordinary, but a long time ago I learned to trust that feeling. 
Though there was nothing I could do out in the mundane world, where humans lived.  So I went inside and took the stairs up.  That usually discouraged would be followers - it was a lot of stairs.  As I stepped inside I felt the feeling again and as I turned around I saw him.

I took a deep breath but I was frozen in fear as I stared at the man who had tormented my childhood.  Garrett smiled at me.  He started weaving patterns of air around him in great tentacles that would lash out at me in my dreams.  I closed my eyes unable to move or do anything else.  

I waited...

But nothing came and I ventured to open my eyes to find nothing at all before me.  This was getting bad.  Really bad.  I hadn't had waking nightmares since I was 7.  I ran up the stairs to my new empty apartment.  It was still early yet.  Not even noon time, but my stomach wasn't hungry, I could barely think about food.

But I had shopping to do both for my apartment and for dinner that night.  It wasn't Sunday, I don't think it was anyway, I'd lost track of all time and really didn't have any bearings in those terms.  But I wanted to impress Dorian and my favorite show-off meal was steak.  So steak it was.

Shopping was boring.  I saved the groceries for last and hoped that the fridgragor in my room actually worked until 7 when I could go to Dorian's.

I purchased the basics - bed, linens, pillows a couch, a set of chairs and a table and cleaning supplies.  I wasn't a neat freak but I needed to clean the staleness out of the room.  Maybe with daylight bulbs and clean floors and walls I'd feel better.  

I set an alarm for 6 so I could shower and get ready for my date with Dorian and then I split my time between projects - cleaning and the folders Dae'lin had given me.  One assignment wasn't really her juristriction - but she'd given the Academy permission to use my services.  It seems they wanted me to teach little kids to use their power.  Stating they were showing early signs and that they couldn't teach them the regular way.

Apparently my paper and lecture had gone over well. 

My alarm chimed and I switched it off and I could feel my pulse start racing in my ears.  Nerves?  Really?  It's not like this was a new phenomenon - getting ready to go out.  But it was new - I liked Dorian.  No I more than liked him.  I wanted him, needed him.  I could almost go so far as to say I loved him, I was definiately nearing that in love stage and the only reason I could tell that was because I was nervous.  

My hands were shaking while I tried to trim my goatee.  I gave up. Last thing i wanted was to hurt myself or to have to shave it all off to begin with.  After my shower I spiked my hair and remembered how Dorian had colored the ends himself.  I was a multicolored porcipine.  Though they weren't standing straight up and they'd fall down quickly enough the way I was sweating.

If I hadn't known Dorian enjoyed my typical style I would have gone more somber, but he'd done my make up for me after I'd gotten out of the hospital.  I wouldn't hide from him.  I knew who I was.  And the makeup wasn't required to be me, but it certainly gave me the confidence to pull through the anxiety.  That was part of the reason I'd started doing it in the first place.

I didn't wear jeans and a t-shirt like I usually would have.  I wanted to impress Dorian.  It was also a new feeling.  I still wore jeans, but they didn't have holes in them and weren't my typical faded blue - black went better this time, and I work a black button up with half the buttons done up with a orange t-shirt underneath.  

When I was satisfied I was presentable which I didn't - I considered changing and removing everything including the hair color but a glance at the time changed my mind again - I grabbed my groceries and headed to Dorian's apartment.  I had to look it up, I didn't remember exactly how to get there, but I managed to be on time.  I knocked on his door at precisely 7pm.

I heard footsteps falling and someone open the door.  But it wasn't Dorian.  I knew I had the right place but the man standing in a pinstrip suit with no shoes on was definitely not Dorian.  Though I did remember him from the Academy.  He greeted me with a smile.  "You must be Nox."

"I am.  Is Dorian home?"  I asked mildly.  My anxiety was through the roof and I could feel my heart in my throat and my palms were sweating.

"He's getting ready.  I'll go check on him."

"We are staying in as far as I'm aware."  

The man looked at me and nodded.  "Yes, I'm aware.  Come on in.  Kitchens..."

I sighed, "I know where it is."

He headed back to Dorian's room and I didn't even hear him knock, but I heard their conversation even though it wasn't very loud.  "Your boy-toy is here, Dorian."  There was a slight hint of laughter in his voice.

"He's not my boy-toy."  Dorian said flatly

The other man giggled.  "He's hot.  Though the hair and the make-up so very retro of him to continue the same style as he did back then."

I rolled my eyes and started taking things out of the bags and looking around Dorian's kitchen to find the equipment I needed.  It wasn't long before Dorian appeared and the man with no shoes was no longer shoeless.  "Dorian, I'll see you round."  He grinned at me.  "I'm Todd, Dorian's best friend.  I'll catch you round too I imagine."  Todd offered me his hand.

I beamed at him as I took it gently in my hand and lifted it to my lips for a tender kiss.  "A pleasure."  The look on Todd's face spoke volumes but I couldn't exactly interpret it - he was either highly pleased or completely taken back.  Either way I'd done my best to  set him off his game.

Todd turned to Dorian and they exchanged a look before Todd was turning on his heals and heading out the door.  "Another day, boys."

I grinned at Dorian as Todd left and he was shaking his head at me.  "You flirt with everyone."  Dorian closed the distance between us and wrapped his arms around my waist.  

"He did say I was hot."

Dorian laughed as he kissed my neck, "What else did you hear?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing."  Dorian's mouth caressed my neck and when he bit softly a s mall sound escaped my throat and Dorian chuckled against it.  "I need to cook."

Dorian pulled away to look me in the eyes, "I can think of other things we could be doing."

I laughed as I pulled out of Dorian's strong arms, he didn't fight me too bad as I did it.  I started working on cutting vegetables as Dorian rounded the bar and sat down.  "We have plenty of time for that."  I winked at Dorian.  "But I need to eat."

Dorian watched me as I made dinner.  Though he did busy himself with setting the table and pouring wine.  He handed me a fluted wine glass and smiled at me.  "Todd, thinks your style is a bit retro.  Things you did when you were younger."  

I grinned at him, "I heard that too."

Dorian nodded.  "I didn't have the heart to tell him, that I liked it.  You aren't afraid to be you."

"Who else can I be?  I mean do you want to see the frightened child?  Not that you haven't already but that's not awe inspiring or attractive."

Dorian walked set down his glass and took mine from me and turned me around to face him.  "There is nothing unattractive about you, Nox."  He rans his fingers down my back, caressing the scars that he knew lay underneath my shirts.  "I want to see all of you."

I kissed him softly and turned around to finish cooking the steaks that were  making Dorian's aparment smell even better than it already did.  Dorian started to move away but I caught his hands and pulled them back against me.  He held me while I finished cooking.  "You can have it all Dorian."  I whispered.

I turned off the burner and stepped away from the stove then wrapped my arms around Dorian as I turned in his arms.  "We can eat now."  I kissed him softly.  My body tightened as he ran his fingers along the top of my jeans under my shirt.  "Food, first."  I nipped at his neck and up to his ear and whispered, "Then more of this.  Please?"  I could hear the pleading in my voice.

Dorian pulled away taking me by the hand and grabbed a plate I'd dished out and I took the other one as Dorian lead me to the table and we sat down to eat.  We chatted about many things, but mostly about what I would be doing for the Academy.  As Dorian was one of the lead testers, he wanted to use my expertise and change the testing, but that required a lot of working together and training which I was the only one at the moment who knew how.

He also told me about the kids in the class I was teaching.  Aidan was one of them, to Stella's knowledge Aidan was a normal child, but Dorian had already seen signs of his abilities and had arranged to have him in this starting level class/day care instructor.  There were four other children.  One Dorian said I might remember - a half dragon whom I'd rescued as a baby from his parents.  His parents were dead now and he was under Venatori care as half human dragons were slaughtered by their kin.  He had no where else to go.  There were three other children, one of which was deaf and a twin, and another very shy and quiet boy.  All whom I got to meet the next day at my first lesson to which I was not prepared.

When we were done, Dorian got up to clean the dishes and I shook my head.  "I got it.  I made the mess."

Dorian shrugged.  "I like watching you."

It made me grin as I cleared the table and Dorian moved with his glass of wine to the bar to watch me clean his kitchen and the dishes.  I hurried but not too fast.  My heart was already racing at the prospect of spending intatate time alone with Dorian.  I wanted to touch him so badly.  I wanted to feel his body against mine and I jumped when Dorian slipped his arms around me as I dried the last dish and put it away in the capbinet above me.  

I could feel his need against my backside.  I felt the heat of his breath against my neck.  My pulse quickened as I turned around and he pushed me against the sink.  He grinned at me and brushed his lips against mine lightly before he put them against my neck and I felt my knees buckle but Dorian caught my weight and I shifted to stand alone, but Dorian's body was pinning me in that awkward position.  I didn't care, there was nothing more that I wanted than to have him touching me.

I hadn't really paid much attention to what Dorian was wearing when I walked in.  His tyical button down with long sleeves soon became a nusiance as I untucked it from his pants to get to his skin underneath.  His skin was warm under my cold finger and Dorian flinched a little and chuckled against my neck before he bit sharply.  I tried to speak, but it stuttered as Dorian sucked on my adam's apple as he switched to the other side of my neck.  "We should probably go someplace a little less dangerous."

Dorian didn't stop what he was doing he grabbed me by the belt loops of my jeans and backed up.  We ran into the bar once, and another wall before reaching Dorian's bedroom door which he backed up against and I was pressing his body against the closed door.  Dorian pulled my chin down with one hand and reached for the door behind him with the other and opened slowly kissing me deeply as we stepped into the darkned room.  

The door closed behind us and Dorian turned me around and backed me up against the bed and pushed me backwards once my legs hit the end of the bed.  I obliged him and awkwardly moved back as Dorian climbed on top of me his legs astride mine.  He sat on my midsection and ran his fingers under my shirt and started pushing both of them over my head.  His fingers tickling my sides as he pulled it over my heads and freeing my head but left the them binding my arms above my head.  I laughed softly as he kissed my lips and moved to kiss me else where.  

He sat up and all I saw was the lust in his eyes as he pulled his own shirt over his head.  I wanted to touch him but he looked like he was enjoying the fact that I'd stayed in the position he'd left my arms without having to ask.  I asked in all seriousness.  "Do you remember the safe words?"

Dorian nodded and leaned down and kissed my neck and then to my ear he whispered the safe words and their instructions while he bit and licked and sucked on my ear.  I managed to get say, "Good" before he was kissing me deeply and his fingers were undoing the button on my jeans.  My heart fluttered and the gentle touch of Dorian sent my heart racing.  He kissed down my neck, his tongue caressing the lines of collar bone and his teeth nipping at the tender skin.  My breath caught in my throat.  Dorian had just started kissing at the line above my jeans at my left hip when his phone started ringing.  He paused only to pick it up and swipe it off before tossing it across the room.  

I bit my lip as he continued to caress the skin above my jeans as he unzipped them with one hand.  The phone rang again and we tried to ignore it.  But it rang a third time and I sighed.  "You better get that."

Dorian sat up and looked at me, his blue eyes were dark with desire and his lips were wet and swollen from kissing me.  "You sure?"

I nodded.  "They'll keep calling and it's distracting.  It could be important."

Dorian slide off the bed and grinned at me, "Don't move."

I smiled, "Hadn't planned on it."

The phone rang a forth time and Dorian picked up.  I could hear the other side shout, "What the fuck Dorian!  Somethings wrong with Aidan.  You have to help."

I said, "Let's go as I unfurled my arms from the bindings of Dorian's making."

He frowned,  "We'll be right there Stella."
