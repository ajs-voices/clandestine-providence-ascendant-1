## Leader of the Pack

The Shaffer family and Bret's son, Jordan, slept with Raf, Jo and myself that night, all curled around each other in what I can only describe as a puppy pile.  It was my first non-demon related nightmare I'd had in a long time and I wasn't the only one waking from it, Jordan was sitting wide eyed in the darkness and I pulled him on top of me to soothe his fears.  I don't know if it was his nightmare or mine, but I suspected it was his.

Elena came by early and had breakfast with us.  She walked with me to Auto's garage where I found the old man sitting down in Betty's desk looking over my schedule.  He smiled once he saw me.  "You are going to have to adjust this schedule of yours.  There are things you need to do at specific times."

He stood up and frowned, "Weekly isn't going to cut it now, boy.  You are going to have to plan month at a time.  Will that help you stay sane?"

I smiled, "As long as there some regularity to my life I should be fine.  Thanks for remembering."

Elena was looking at me curiously.  "Anxiety?  What else?"

"I was diagnosed with PSTD as a child, it's not really an issue now, but it was in combination with OCPD.  Side affects were anxiety and depression.  As long as I keep change to a minimum I'm usually okay."

Elena laughed, "Minimum, that's going to be hard, Nox.  This life is not some standardized test like the Venatori."

"I know.  It wasn't in the field either, but I managed.  At least now, unlike in the field, I have people supporting me full time."  I squeezed her hand, "And for that I'm grateful."

For the next few months I learned all about the pack.  I met every single member in my metaphyscial connection on an intamate level.  Elena insisted that I have dinner with everyone no matter their age.  So everyone came to the pack house, and we talked while I made dinner for two and then we ate in the privacy of the kitchen while everyone else had whatever Emily cooked that night.  There was some grumbling as I wasn't cooking for them too but Emily told them things would return to normal when the introductions were done.  I even had dinner with the newest member of the pack, a three month old name Aaron.

There were only a few young men in the pack that were going to cause me grief and mostly because they were homophobes.  The first thing out of one of their mouths before they sat down at the bar with me was I don't suck cock.  

I laughed and replied.  "I didn't ask you to.  And if that is the first thing you think of when you say I'm gay then you truly are a little delusional.  I like cock and prefer it in other orafices."

He gave me a gruttal cry of disbelief that I would be so bold.  I washed my hands of the hamburger I'd been kneeding at and offered, "Let's start over.   My name is Nox.  You must be Harvey. "

He took my hand and shook too firmly trying to show how tough he was. I gave as good as I got.

Elena and Auto sat with me every night teaching me the hierarchy of this pack and other packs in the City and in relation to the whole country.  They also instructed me in the overall politics of the CCB.  Helping navigate the pitfalls of most pack leaders.   The fact that I knew vampires personally helped a great deal.  

I had pack leader meetings to attend every week and I was invited to attend officers meetings where James asked me about the Venatori. I gave them what wouldn't hurt my family and friends.  But the more time went on the less I felt the need to project anyone other than Dorian.  I missed him a lot. I had a feeling I was going to miss him a lot for a long time. 

Nothing James asked me worried me not even with the thought that they had plans to do damage to the building. That worried me more the longer I saw the hatred for the Venatori. But I hadn't heard anything about any plans. But I kept listening anyway.  Some one, some where wanted Mark Green dead.

Elena had been true to her word and was setting me up with women from inside my pack, and others from outside. There was Tiffany who was a blonde bombshell but with the brains of a peanut.  Even Elena rejected her once she opened her mouth.

Sandra was a pretty little brunette, but she was much too butch for my tastes, her hair was cropped short, she had more muscle than I ever would, and she liked women.  She figured since I liked men it would be a good match.  I informered her I liked women and she sneered at me with a disgust that some people had against bis. They beleived that we should choose a side.  She was rejected on that fundamental disagreement.

Allison was not pretty in the sense that she a good looking woman.  With a little work she could be be drop dead gorgeous but she chose to wear her hair long and straight or in a pony tail.  Her glasses were several seasons out of fashion, and her attire was the same.  I didn't mind that she was homely at first glance, actually it was one of the reasons I agreed to see her.  But we didn't get far on that first date.

Allison was a relgious woman.  She was raised a strict Catholic.  Pre-maratial sex was a no-go for her.  And while that wouldn't have been a turn off, the fact that Elena inisited I follow the old tradition of inpregnating as many women as possible and whoever produced the first male heir was to be my mate.  While I didn't intend to do it per tradition exactly I wasn't exactly looking for love so it was a sensible solution.

And I wouldn't even have considered searching for a mate if Elena and Auto hadn't agreed that a proper heirarchy inside my pack would make my life easier and the fact that I wasn't a werewolf proper allowed me to delgate the parts necessary to those who cold actually shift.  So I searched for women I could tolerate for life.  

Allison excluded herself from the selection the moment she found out about the heir situation.  But we'd had a good time up till then.  And I asked her to stick around and help me with some of the more intellectual members of the pack.  I had doctors and lawyers and several techies that liked to talk over my head.  Allison agreed to stay for a little while and help defuse the situation.

And then there was Isabel Reyes.  She was a spit fire that most pack leaders had rejected because she never followed the rules.  Elena rejected her on those rejections but when she saw the look on my face when I heard she didn't follow the rules, she brought her in anyway.  Isabel was a kindred spirit.  She rebeled against her family of traditional werewolves who did everything by the book.  She was game for the whole let's produce an heir.  She was more than just a pretty face though, Isabel had a great head on her shoulders.  

In the month that I dated her she brought to my attention more little problems that would have caused major problems if I hadn't dealt with them while they were small.  She also pointed out that Allison was the one causing the intellectual problems.  Isabel had made friends with all the old possiblities and none of them had been allowed to stay in the pack.  They were causing all sorts of problems with the men.  Namely they were saying that they'd been the leaders mate and that gave them certain rights.  So they had to go.

Elena was happy with the dynamic between Isabel and I.  And she and Auto agreed that she was perfect even with all the rejection from the other pack leaders she'd seen before.  Her family was from a small pack from New Mexico and if she produced a male heir then that pack would become mine.  It wasn't something that I had wanted but Elena snapped up the offer the moment Isabel's father suggested it.  Power she said was worth any price and she sang another tune.

Elena called after me as Isabel and I were leaving the conference room we'd called her father from.  "Nox, darling.  Can we talk?"

I turned and waved my hand as I had other things to take care of.  My life hadn't gotten easier being pack leader it became even busier.  "Without Isabel, sorry dear." She said to Isabel with a smile.

I shrugged.  "You know I'll just tell her anyway right?"

She sighed.  "Alright then.  The pair of you should just become man and wife witout the whole male heir."

"But you said..."  Elena interrupted me when she laid her finger to my lips.

"Darling, I know what I said.  But that was before we met the lovely Isabel.  She is the perfect counterweight.  She sees things you do not.  And you get along with her, there is only one thing holding you back."

"And what is that?"  I asked.

"Dorian."  Elena said crisply.

Isabel stepped in front of me, her short stature barely coming to the middle of my chest and still two or three inches shorter than Elena.  I couldn't see the smile that splayed on her face but I knew it was there.  "I know all about the love of his life, Ms. Elena.  Nox is an open book.  He can love the man and be married to me.  If ever they want to play house again I'm open to it.  The pack be damned."

"Dorian is not an obstacle.  It may become an issue down the road, but Dorian is married and having children with her.  He's not waiting around for me, pining after my dead soul, so I don't hold out much hope for a future with that ghost of my past no matter how much I will love him until I die."

Elena snorted, "If you ever die..."

I grined at her, "Yes, there is that.  If you think the pack will be alright with it, I'll bring it up at the next moon."

"You are growing into such a leader, Nox."  Elena squeezed my hand as she left Isabel and I together.  We were off to see about a few orphans that had been seen in Central Park that were thought to be were's of some sort but no one could get close enough to the feral children. So Isabel and I were going to try.
