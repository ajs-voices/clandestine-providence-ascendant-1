## One Last Night

I walked the cooridors of the pschye ward for about an hour before I found myself walking past a room just as a peircing scream let lose and a large crash followed by a scrambling orderly running out of the room.  I caught the door before it latched closed and found Jo cowering in a corner.

A voice came over the intercom, "Nox, you need to get out of there, it's not safe."

I looked up at the camera and shook my head.  "She can't hurt me.  I'm at full capacity."

"Don't be an idiot.  Get out of there."

"Sorry, can't do that."  Nox threw a wall of air in front of the door and it wouldn't open no matter how hard they tried to shove things around.

There was low rumble coming from the corner of the room where Jo huddled against herself.  I sat down in the middle of the floor and just sat there watching the small girl turn her snarling face my direction.  Her eyes had gone amber and her lip quivered as she growled.  "How has no one understood what was going on?"  It baffled me what Venatori went through to be ignorant of things.  This was clearly a case of werewolf close to the full moon.  Anger and agression, even her eyes changed colors.  People really didn't pay any attention in their classes.

I don't know how much time passed before I moved a little closer.  Jo had stopped rumbling until I'd done that.  I wove a shield of air around my body, so close it almost hurt.  I didn't want to put up a wall and hurt her but I didn't want her to bite me either.  Venatori die when bitten, it's worse than not surviving the disease.  It was like lycanthropy was designed to kill Venatori.  And I wouldn't put past whatever created us to do just that - we were immortal once.

I moved closer to Jo whenever she calmed down and understood I wasn't going to hurt her.  I don't know how long I sat there on the cold cement floor.  My legs were going numb but I was with in arms reach of her.  I reached out and touched a lock of hair that had fallen in front of her now amber eyes.  She sniffed at my hand much like a dog did and nuzzled it softly.  That was a good sign.

I moved closer and removed the barrier from my body.  I could easily defend myself but I wanted her close.  I pulled her against me and leaned against the wall.  

I could feel the sun go down and when the moon rose Jo started to whimper.  It woke me from the shallow sleep I'd drifted into.  Surprised to have driftec I was awake as I heard the first cry of pain from the girl in my lap.  I held her close as her body quaked and quivered against me.  I watched as her body transformed underneath my arms, her back arching against me and she turned over in my lap on all fours.  Her face against my neck and I started to feel panicked.  My heart started to race as the change continued.  

I don't know how long it took it felt endless as I held her and told her was going to be alright until she was lying in a large brindle fur coated wolf on my legs pressing her head against my chest.  I kissed the top of her head and she sat back and howled at the moon.

There was an howl outside the window of another's call and another.  She returned their cry and began to dance around.  She needed to hunt, but that wasn't going to happen in here.  I got up in her bed and pulled her with me, she struggled and I could feel an eager energy about her and I could see it wafting in waves around her.  I reached out and touched the patterns around her and she looked at me with curiousity in those amber eyes.  

Jo, the wolf, climbed into her bed and curled up next to me and put her head on my shoulder.  I sat there with a large wolf leaning on me until we drifted off to sleep.

I woke from a nightmare of wolves hunting my demon and ending up dead themselves.  Jo lay curled up naked laying her head on my legs.  The sun was streaming through her window up on high and I touched her shoulder tenatively.  She stirred and scrambled away from me clutching at her sheets.

I held up my hands to say I surrender, but she blushed and hurried towards her dresser gathering up clothes and tried to get out of her room.  I'd forgotten the barrier on the door and she stared at it with confusion.  "Sorry."  I removed it.  "You can go through now."

She turned with the pale sheet wrapped around her, "What happened?"

I grinned at her.  "You transformed last night."

She asked, "Why aren't you dead? Or am I not?"

"I don't know really but you trusted me, I guess."  I smiled at her.  "Things should go better now, Jo."  I stood up and straightened out my shirt and jeans before stepping up to the little wolf girl with a grin.  "I will speak with the local pack and try to find you a home here in the city.  You don't need these walls, you need a pack."

Jo still didn't look like she believed me but I'd met enough werewolves to know that a pack can do you a lot of good - much better than the mental hospital that has no idea what they are handling.

I stepped into the hall and Madison was rushing my way.  She hurried Jo into the bathroom and guided me away from her room.  "Nox, that could have gone very badly."

"I told you she wouldn't hurt me."  I walked where she guided me which was back to my room.

We stood outside my open door.  "Why were you so confident?"

"Because I'm a cocky bastard?"  I gave her that look that said I beleived it, and in a way I did.  "Because I knew she couldn't.  I'm not your run of the mill Venatori.  I could have locked my self behind walls of air, like I kept everyone out all night long even in my sleep.  But I knew she wouldn't hurt me."

"But you didn't know."  Madison sounded exasperated.  "You have a visitor."

I raised my eyebrow and stepped inside my room and grinned.  "Well Hello you." 

I heard Madison stomping off the other direction and I laughed.  Dorian smiled at  me as he turned around.  "What was she mad at?"

I grinned playfully at Dorian.  "I spent the night with a girl."

He arched an eyebrow and I laughed.  "The little werewolf transformed last night.  I kept her from hurting anyone or herself."

I saw Dorian relax as I told him about Jo.  He really had thought ... "You really thought I'd sleep with someone else?"  I closed the distance between us and stood as close to Dorian as possible.  

There was a momentary frown before Dorian spoke, "It's not as if you are the mangomous type."

I asked, "Is that what you want?"  I added, "With me?"

Dorian took a deep breath and stepped back.  "I don't know Nox.  I like this."  He waved his hands between the two of us and I smiled but I didn't say anything I'd let him continue.  "But you aren't exactly the most reliable partner.  So many hurt girls and boys from  your past and those are only the ones that were here in the Academy."

I nodded.  "You ever think it was because I hadn't found the right partner?"  I wanted to touch Dorian, but I held my ground.  "Look Dorian.  I know my past is a lot to take in, but I have no intentions of hurting you."  Dorian looked like he wanted to say something but I held up my finger asking him to wait while I finished. "I do not intend to sleep around, or tarnish your image, or anything else that might hurt you.  But I'm fallable, I will fuck up.  I do better with rules.  If there are things about my lifestyle that bother you, you need to speak up so I can adjust before they become too much."

I held my hand out palm facing up and nodded giving him the chance to talk and Dorian smiled.  "I don't know what's going to turn out to be too much Nox.  Never dated a guy like you."

I grinned at him.  "I'm improbable."  I took a step to close the distance between us but not so close I would impose upon Dorian this time like I had last time.  "If you don't know then I'll ask some questions now."  Dorian nodded.  "Do you want me to stop flirting with guys?"

He gave a slight nod and my heart sank, "Is that flirting in general or just guys?"

Dorian backed up and sat down on my bed.  "Nox.  You would stop being you to please me?"

I stood in the middle of my room and nodded, "If it bothers you that much yes."  I stepped up to Dorian and squatte down in front of him taking his hands in mine.  "I will do my best to not flirt with people.  It will be hard."

Dorian shook his head.  "I won't change a fundamental peice of your persona, that's not fair."  He smiled, "But keep the physical flirting to a minimum."

I grinned, "I will touch no one but you in any flirting manner.  I can handle that."

Dorian pulled me close and I fell to my knees and he leaned down and kissed me.  We hadn't even got started when someone cleared their throat behind me.  I knew who it was just from the singular sound.  She'd done it often enough when I was a child.  "Hi Dae'lin."

I stood up and turned around.  She handed me several folders and an envelope.  "Work for the next few weeks while you remain out of field duty.  The envelope containes your release instructions.  First and foremost, Dorian is to escort you to Dr. Silverman's office for your release consultation and go over those contents."

I nodded.  "Alright."

Dae'lin smiled past me.  "Nice seeing you Dorian."  She grinned then back at Dorian.  "You could do better than this Dorian."

Dorian chuckled.  "I'm not sure about that, Dae'lin.  He's quite the catch from what I've seen.  Even your neice seems interested."

I turned around and gave Dorian an incredulous look.  He really said that.  He really told Dae'lin that Daneilla had flirted with me.

Dae'lin sighed, "Nothing new.  She seems to have a thing for men who are so not what she needs."

"Her friend seemed to just want sex.  I hope she's careful."

Dorian stood up and wrapped his arm around me.  "Yeah she slapped him for his comment."

"Do I want to know what it was?"  Dae'lin asked.

Dorian shook his head.  "No, you don't."  

Dorian picked up my bag and handed it to me.  "Shall we leave this dreadful place?"

I nodded.  As we walked out Dae'lin joined us and I asked, "Can you get me the number for the local were wolf pack leaders here in the city?  I need to contact them.  I can call a friend, while he's an alpha he's not exactly in a pack."

Dae'lin nodded.  "I'll email the list to you."

We stopped at the front desk while Dae'lin kept on going.  I was handed yet another stack of papers to carry out.  Which Dorian took from my hands  so he could hold my hand as we exited the phschye ward and headed to Margo's office a few floors down.
