## Demons Behind Orange Doors

Dorian asked me, "What do you normally do?"

I grinned.  "Throw fireballs."

He smiled.  "You could show me how."

"Really?"

He nodded.  "Testing your theory.  Even though I've seen it in action.  Nothing better than doing it yourself."

I nodded and he got up and dropped a hundered dollar bill on the table.  I could feel the shock in my wide eyes.  He only smiled at me.  "It was worth it."

Dorian wrapped his arm around my waist and walked me out the front door and he asked, "Where to?"

"A fire room would be best."  I said trying to hide the fear in my voice.  My demon's lurked behind those orange doors in the AU building.  I always found it amazing that my favorite color to this day is the color those doors are painted.  Maybe it's my mind's way of saying you can't scare me.  But they were very unsettling.

Dorian's arm remained around my waist the entire way through the lobby and to the elevator - he only removed it so we could pass through the doors.  He had been very hands off before and I wondered what had changed.

The elevator dinged open and a half a dozen people filed out and we stepped inside.  Dorian's hand still on my waist.  I leaned against the wooden bar and half against him as he held me close.  I could smell the soft scent of vanilla and a touch of cinamon.  He always smelled that way to me, even when I first met him.  I whispered.  "What's changed?"

He looked at me, our faces a hair's breath apart.  I wanted to kiss him so bad as I looked into his deep blue eyes.  He whispered back, "What do you mean?"

I took his fingers in mind.  "This."

He smiled at me.  "Your candor."

"My candor?"  Being honest.. I was slightly confused.

Dorian whispered softly in my ear.  I could feel his warm breath against my neck and it sent shivers down my spine.   "You bared your soul to me.  I can do the same."  Those words made more sense to me than him telling me straight out.  Dorian Vega was always perferct.  He had perfect grades.  His clothes were always perfectly pressed.  His hair always perfectly kept.  In all things Dorian was perfect.  His image was everything.  He was tarnishing his image to bear his soul to me - to show the world that yes, I'm gay.

The elevator dinged and  people piled on the elevator with us, I started to step away once I heard the sound of the door opening but Dorian was firm in his embrace and I didn't push too hard to stay close to him.  I felt his arm tensing and I could see the patterns shifting around him.  He was nervous.  I hummed a little tune under my breath in Dorian's ear.  The song was a comfort to me when I was anxious.  I found myself humming it a lot.

We finally got to the Academy levels and got out and headed down the halls towards the training centers.  Dorian's arm slipped from my waist and he took my hand in his.  His hand was warm and I hadn't realized how cold I was.  The halls were empty save for a few students who were late to class.  Dorian asked softly, "What was that you hummed?"

"A dragon's lullaby my Nanny use to sing to me.  I've forgotten the words and never knew the name, but it's always been a comfort to me."

Dorian smiled.  "It was nice."  We arrived at one of the first available fire starter room and the orange painted door was closed but said it was vacant.  I stared at the color that I could tolerate except for painted on a flat metal door.  Dorian opened the door and I was frozen.  It had been years since I'd stepped foot in one of these rooms.

"Everything alright?"

Dorian had let go of me and was standing in side the room of my nightmares.  I probably had used this room, or maybe not.  They were all identical - the orange painted door, the metal encasing the room inside.  Inflamable furniture.  There was no plastic inside - just in case there was a fire.  It would heat like an oven, but the fire supression would kick in and put out the fire.  These were the safest rooms in the building in case of fire.  I hated them.

But they were the safest place to through fireballs when you wanted to vent.

Dorian asked again.  "You okay?"  He didn't seem upset about repeating himself -  more concerned than anything.

"Yeah.  Just brings back memories."

Dorian stepped behind me and closed the door and picked up his phone and made a call.  I didn't pay attention as I stared at the far wall. A wall I saw every night in my nightmares.  It wasn't always this prestine and shiny.  It ususally wasn't.  But this was a room filled with nothing but terror.  I could feel it oozing off of me.

Dorian stepped up next to me.  "The camera and mics are off.  What's wrong Nox?"

I blinked at him like I didn't understand what he said.  Maybe I didn't really.  I couldn't phathom why he'd do that.  "Bad memories."

"Tell me about them."

I shook my head.  "I'd rather not.  My demon's lurk behind orange doors."

Dorian nodded and sat down on the floor crossleged and he patted the spot in front of him.  I looked at him before it dawned on me he was trying to ease my fears and push me into the reason we were here, to teach him to throw fireballs.

I took a deep breath and sat down in front of Dorian with my legs crossed, our knees touched and I stared across at the man I'd had a major crush on when I was much younger.  Now it felt like so much more than a crush - so much more consuming.

I held out my hands and wove a pattern of fire in a neat ball above my hand.  I could feel the heat, but it didn't burn me.  Dorian glanced at the ball of fire.  I intoned my instructions.  "Think of the color red and draw a line from yourself to the ball."

Dorian closed his eyes and I watched him even though I couldn't follow what his eyes told me, but I didn't need to.  There was a clear visible red line drawn from Dorian to the glowing red orb in my hand.  "That wasn't so hard." Dorian congradulated himself.

I smiled.  "Do you want to do it with the other elements?"

"Why not."

I let the small orb go and formed a blue one in it's place - water.  It was my heardest element but I could weave it faster than most Magnus could who were strongest in water.  It said a lot about the preceived power I held.  

Dorian drew the line with ease.  We did the same with air even though he already thought he was connected.  But when he finished he opened his eyes and mouthed, wow.  He was feeling the new power flowing inside him - the realization that everything he'd been taught was wrong.  It was a powerful effect.

Dorian did the final element of earth and I stood up.  "Let's play catch."

My idea of throwing fireballs had slipped away in the moments I watched Dorian enjoying the new power.  I was more than happy to vent my anxiety in a more productive way.  I formed four orbs one for each element.  "The object is to catch the orb with the correct weave so that it doesn't disappaite."

I wove a net of air that caught the ball of air in front of me when I tossed it up to show Dorian what I meant.  "The elemental net will feed the ball so it can make the distance.  We'll start closer together, then we can move apart."

I first tossed Dorian the air orb and he caught it easily.  Air was his primary element.  And since he couldn't handle more than one at a time, I instructed, "Toss it back."  He did so and I caught the air.  "Earth next."

I tossed each element to Dorian a few times declaring which I was sending over first so he could get the appropriate weave up.  And then I started just tossing randomly at him.  He dropped quite a few of them without the appropriate warning.  But he never was discouraged.  He was doing better than anyone I had ever seen on their first day in the Academy at Magnus training.  Though we didn't do this.

Dorian's phone rang and he frowned.  "I need to take this."

I nodded and took a few steps away and formed a fireball and drowned myself in the noise of the patterns around me.  I focused on the feel of the heat from my creation and then I sent it flying towards the wall and watched it splatter in an array of sparks of oranges and yellows.  My favorite color was one of the first colors to splatter across the wall and I let the image linger in my mind as I created the next.  I focused only on the fire and the splatter.  There was nothing but me and the fireballs.

Dorian touched my arm and I jumped.  I looked at him and saw a frown etching lines into the corner of his eyes.  He spoke calmly, "There has been an emergency.  I need to go handle it.  I'd like to pick up the discussion we didn't have at some point."

I nodded and smiled.  "My schedule will always be open for you."

He laughed. "I will make sure your calendar is free.  If Dae'lin is to be beleived you are nerotic about it."

I nodded.  "Have to be."

Dorian paused for several moments I could almost see the smoke coming out of his ears as he thought about something.  He looked like he was searching my face for some answer.  I wanted to kiss him - to taste his lips.  I swallowed hard as the desire started to over come me.  He gave me a lazy smile and whispered softly, "I will see you again. Very soon, Nox."

I could only nod, my own desires leaving me breathless.  Dorian chuckled as he left.  I stood staring after him.  I don't know how long I stood there before the worst possible thing that could happen to me happened - Garrett Spencer walked into the room and locked the door behind him.
