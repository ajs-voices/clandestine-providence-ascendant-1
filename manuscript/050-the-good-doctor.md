## The Good Doctor

Adrian called Margo and supposedly got Jo released or will get Jo released under my care - citing I was her Alpha and he'd take responsibility for us both; me being an Exuli now.  That still rubbed the wrong way.  The tattoo at my temple still hurt even after three days.

I crashed in Gregory's room and he was the perfect gentleman.  Maybe not to Dorian's tastes, but he never once tried to make a move.  I kissed him one morning without thinking about it.  He just grinned at me when I had a panic attack afterwards.  "No big deal man,"  was all he could say.

I managed to get things relayed to Marco and Ant about my father.  Ant said he'd contact my Dad to get things straightened out.  Marco agreed to keep watch out for strange things.  Bernstein was annoying as usual and refused to even speak to me.  But really it didn't matter, I had the son of Il Cane and the Darkness behind the Crown on my side of things.  Bernstein was hardly anything compared to them, he wasn't even as old as Ant.

I didn't have any talents to speak of;  there was nothing I could do to make money.  Stephen joked that I could do magic tricks like one of those fake magicians - except it's real.  I was bored what could I say.

I set an alarm for thirty minutes before the alloted time on the note I was handed when I was exiled and I stuck my unfunctioning phone into my pocket - the service was cut off but hey wi-fi was nearly free everywhere these days.  I set up in central park with the rest of the buskers, set out can next to me on the ground and I started playing with my magic.

I started out slowly trying to make things work without looking like I was making them appear out of thin air.  I was good at my job but this was different.  Slight of hand was never my thing.  I borrowed a deck of cards from Stephen and a few cups from the party the night before - they were used but I washed them, no one else was going to touch them anyway.

I started with a few card tricks.  The first few flopped and I got a few laughs which earned me a few dollars when I played the idiot.  I started to get the hang of it and was fliping cards up and and around with the flicks of my finger tips.  They rolled from front to back with ease the more I got used to the fine manipulations of air that were unseen to the humans around me.

A few people told me they liked my tattoo.  I grinned a thanks at them and turned to show them the one on my neck.  Which usually garnered more compliments.  I couldn't see it so it could be completely not what I picked out when I was 16 but I knew it wasn't.  Though I always joked about it and the crowds that walked through central parked seemed to enjoy the game I was playing.

I created several balls of out thin air, pretending they'd been hidden in my pockets or in my backpack that sat next to me the whole time.  The balls were solidificed elements wrapped in air and I tugged on them like there were strings attached to them and they flew around me like yo-yos.  This was something I did to practice coordination.  I got a few more people to stop and drop money with this.  I ignored most people who stopped to watch but every once and a while a guy would stop and stare at me and when I would wink at him he'd wander away.  The girls were a little more leniant when I flirted with them.  They'd stay and chat for a while - and often they'd leave a tip.

My phone went off and threw the balls up into the air and they burst like bubbles.  That gained me a few more dollars in the can which I picked up and apologized.  "Sorry mates, gotta date."

I met Ant down on the subway platform where we always met and he handed me a burner phone.  He laughed softly to himself.  "Nice nails."

I smiled sweetly at him waggling my fingers at him.  "You like?"  

Ant rolled his eyes. "Cari says you can keep that.  She'll pay for the minutes as long as you aren't having phone sex with your lovers."  

I laughed as Ant continued, "Fairly certain she means me and Marco not Dorian."

I smiled.  "I've not spoken to him in three days.  I need to stay away from him.  I can't let this hurt him.  Garrett could still hurt him - them."

But I had a call to make.  It was a standard flip phone.  I hadn't used one of these in years.  It felt awkward in my hands as I held it to my ear.  It picked up in one ring, and an recorded message gave me an address. I jotted the address down on a peice of paper Ant handed me with a pencil and hung up.

Out of curiousity I called again and the number never picked up it gave me the this number is out of service.  Well then.

"Hey Ant, can I ask you a favor?"

"Sure. "  He paused and gave me a sideways look, "I think."

"Can you visit Dorian? And give him this."  I handed Ant an old school portfolio folder we used to use in school to hold papers.  It contained things I'd been drawing since I'd met him.  And a few notes about how to put my knowledge into actual use.  

Ant took the folder from me and nodded.  "You don't want me to kiss him or tell him you love him or anything?"  He gave me a look that clearly said he'd not mind doing so.

I grinned at him.  "No.  I don't want your lips close to him at all."

He looked offended, "Why the fuck not?  I could be good to him."

"You can't bite him Ant.  That's the only reason you like men.  While I don't mind you feeding on me.  You kill my boyfriend and we are going to have more than words."

He shook with laughter he was trying to hide.  "I did forget that fact.  You being that weird one-off like my mother."

I grinned. "Apparently I'm a one-off in so many ways."  I sighed.  "I gotta go to this place.  Run by it if I don't text you from this number."

He nodded and just like that was gone and I started jogging out of the subway towards my new destination.

The place we met was a fancy restaruant and I was not wearing anything appropriate.  I sighed and went in anyway and the hostest looked at me funny.  I spoke to her softly so as not to draw more attention to myself.  "My name is Nox, and I'm supposed to meet someone here."

The little blonde woman nodded with a smile.  She reached behind the counter and grabbed a suit coat and a tie.  "You can wear these.  Right this way."

I pulled the coat on over my t-shirt and the tie over my neck, I looked like some hipster but hey at least it all looked good.  I wished I'd done a little more with the make up - could have added a bit of color to the outfit.  She lead me to a private dinning room with only one table sat in the middle.  "This way Mr. Setanta."
  
I followed her and sat down at the table where a man sat.  The only thing I could see from the top of his blond head was that he wore an expensive suit and a gold rolex.  When he looked up and I saw his ice blue eyes I pushed my chair back.  "Asher Eriksen. I..."

He waved his hand.  "Come now.  It's not the first time you've been in the presense of the ruling families."

Two plates of an anti-pasto salad were set in front of us and Asher nodded. "I'm sure you are hungry.  The antics you are playing at these days pay far less than you are used to."

I smiled.  "I get by.  I've got a few people looking out for me."  But I didn't hesitate to eat what was offered me.  I just prayed he didn't expect me to pay for any of it.  I couldn't even on my hunter salary.

"You've some exotic friends - werewolves and vampires.  And not just the low ones that would flock to your power, no you know the Bernstein vampire and Il Cane herself."

I interjected.  "I don't know Cari personally."

Asher laughed, "But the fact that you feel comfortable calling The Hound by her given name says magnitudes about the relationship you have with her son and Chevalier."

I popped an olive into my mouth and when I was finished chewing I spoke softly. "You seem to know a lot about me."

"I've been doing my research into you for a few months now.  Seeing you out in the world is a unique experience.  The werewolves take you in and shelter a rogue Venatori.  That won't look good for them.  And the vampires become your eyes and ears and supply you with a phone.  I'm impressed with the friends you make."

I shrugged.  "That's what happens when you float in my circle."

"And what circle is that?" Asher asked with his hands steppled in front of him.  He hadn't touched anything other than his wine.

I took a swallow of the white wine in front of me and smiled as I remembered Dorian telling me about the flavors.

Asher pushed his plate in front of me.  "I'm good," I said.

He set it to the side.  "Take it home then.  I won't be able to make these arrangements again."

I nodded.  "Why am I here anyway?"

"I need you and Mark needs you.  You are aware of a conspiracy to kill our illustrious leader?"  Asher asked in a tone that said I did.

I shook my head.  "I know Garrett wanted me to try."

"Garrett Spencer?"  Asher looked curiously down at his napkin and the pulled out his phone and started tapping away at something there.

"Yes.  I have no allegience to him anymore, as long as I'm gone he has no reason to hurt anyone I love."

Asher nodded.  "Dorian is safe.  Mr. Green has added extra security to both Stella Row and the Vega estates, as well as to your father's family.  Is there anyone else who he might use against you?  Your suitors?  Jason Hill, has taken a leave of absense to spend it with his family in Florida at a rough suggestion from Dae'lin.  Something about keeping him away from you."

I sighed.  

Asher continued.  "Fear not, the boy doesn't worry for his safety from you, but he went home to keep the children safe from whatever is coming.  Apparently he eluded to the fact that you wouldn't have tried to kill Mark Green without good reason."

"No one really knows that reason do they?"  Asher asked.

"He told me to.  I reported Garrett immediately and he wanted me to follow through.  His guard gave me the note that lead me here."

Asher nodded.  "Yes, he did.  Like I said, he needs you and I need you.  A fair exchange."

"How is that fair?"

"Not to you my boy, to my ability to come here without anyone knowing what I'm doing.  Being an eccentric I get away with much more than anyone else."  Ahsher smiled.

The second round of food arrived - a hot bowl of tomatoe bisque.  Don't ask me how I knew that but I did.  I sipped at it and found it too hot.  "What does he want from me?"

"I'm sure you've guessed - fall little one.  Become what would make our evil-doers seek a vengeful soul out to do their dirty work.  That's what they did with Levi Hughes afterall, until you jumped off a building after him that is."

"why would they come after me again?  I failed."

Asher held up his finger and smiled at me.  "But not because you didn't try.  Mark was prepared for you, they don't know that, but they know you are more powerful than he is.  They will try again to recruit you.  You need to fall so low it looks like its plausible for you to do that again."

"So this is just another mission, except the payment is my exile."

Asher nodded his head sadly.  "If we deal with the culprit then we will pay you handsomely and set you up for life but yes the exile stands."

"And if I don't agree to this?"

Asher shrugged. "No lost cause for us.  You are still exiled."

I nodded.  "What do you want?"

Asher smiled as if he knew I wouldn't have anymore questions.  "I want your DNA.  You are immortal.  I don't know how I missed you before but I need to study you.  And since you are no longer part of the Venatori I am willing to add in a bonus to your situation.  Dorian will be freed from his obligation to procreate.  He will be allowed to be with an Exuli off campus and remain in good standing, if he so wishes."

"How can you tell me he'd be in good standing?  He'd be shunned more than he already is."

"Not at all, Nox.  Dorian is influential, he stands on is own two feet.  He will survive with out my interference, but then at least the two of you can be together."

"What do you need me to do then?"

"A few cups a month is all I ask."  Asher said flatly.

"You mean you want a sperm donation?"

Asher nodded.  "To use at my own discrection yes."

"For how long?"

"Let's say a year. And then maybe once a year after that to see if there are any changes?"

"For how long?"

"For as long as you live my boy."  Asher said with a smile.

"And if I'm truly immortal?"

Asher smiled, "Then you and I will become very good friends after all your loved ones have died and moved on."

I laughed.  "Are you saying you are..."  I stopped talking as the thoughts ticked away at my brain.  Asher has only been public for a few years now.  Before that he was hidden behind smoke and mirrors. His father was around for a short time.  Every twenty-five years like clockwork the Eriksen line changed handes.  It was almost like... I smiled.  "You are Aeternus.  The last of your kind.  Hiding in plain sight the whole time."

"You are clever."  Asher smiled.  "Patterns, it's all in the patterns isn't it.  I will have to change that up I think."

I took another sip of the soup and relished the flavor and the warmth.  "I will accept both offers."

Asher smiled.  "I never doubted it."  

Asher waved over the waitress.  "Let him finish his courses and box mine all to send with him out the back door."

Asher stood up and straightened his coat and tie and offered me his hand.  "It's been a pleasure doing business with you Mr. Setanta.  The paperwork is here in this envelope, the end sum we will pay you and all other contracts needed waiting your signature.  Leave them here and Mindy will get them to me. "  He took a step away from the table.  "Also, Nox, the address to the sperm bank I want you to use is in the folder.  There will be no more contact between us.  Good luck son."
