## The Jump

The doors opened going up and we waited for everyone to file off.  A smoker had just exited and I could smell nothing but tabacco smoke inside the elevator.  I held my breath.  Two triggers was not going to undo me.

Levi stood in front of us.  I leaned against the wooden rail and stared at my reflection in the door.  I noticed Dorian was watching me through the reflection but I couldn't hold my breath any longer.  I let it out slowly and inhaled shallow breaths trying to avoide the cigarette smoke smell, but it didn't help.  My heart was racing.  My hands were sweaty and I knew I was pale.  Fear raced through my veins turning my body stone cold.  I didn't know if I could move when we stopped.  Dorian leaned in and whispered, "What's wrong?"

I held up two fingers and knew that Dorian didn't understand what I meant, he couldn't.  Levi asked.  "What's wrong with him?"  He didn't sound amused by it actually concerned.

"He doesn't like elevators."  Dorian added, "But this isn't his usual reaction.  Something else is wrong."

The door chimed opened and we got out on the classroom level of the Academy.  My legs were stiff with fear and it hurt to move but I did move.  Dorian never touched me, though I could see the strain as he did.  I took a deep breath of clean fresh air of the Academy.  It still smelled like I remembered - like old musty books.

Levi asked, "You okay?"

I nodded.  "I'll be fine."  I hated that he saw that but it wasn't my fault.  

Dorian walked beside me while Levi followed.

"What happened Nox?"

I shook my head.  "I'll tell you later."  Dorian seemed to except that for now.  I could see the question pending in his head and his photographic memory.  

Jace's classroom was up on the right past an orange fire starter door.  I passed it without looking at it.  I triggered a minor fear but I pushed it aside.  I wasn't going to let my fears rule me anymore today.  That seemed to be all it was doing.

I opened the door to Jace's class room after a quick rap at the wooden door.  All eyes turned to us and Jace looked up from the book he'd been reading from and smiled brightly at me.  "Nox.  Everyone this is my best friend and inspiration, Nox."  He was surprised when Dorian and Levi followed me in. "And it seems Mr. Vega and a guest have come with him.  What ever do we owe for this visit?"

"They are with me."  Jace relaxed visibly.  "You aren't in trouble.  Levi here is a bit green around the edges I thought a couple of sessions here might help.  You invited me remember."

"And Mr. Vega's prsenses isn't an evaluation?"  Jace asked.  It seemed more curiousity than fear that spurred it.

Dorian shook his head.  "I'm not here for an evaluation.  Well, not yours anyway."

Jace laughed.  "You are evaluating Nox?  Come one he won't teach.  He's a hunter.  Born breed and taught to be nothing else."

I reminded Jace.  "So were you.  Look at you now."

Jace shook his head.  "I wasn't born to be a hunter.  Your mother and your father were both excellent hunters even though she was only human.  She brought down just as many baddies as your father in her tenure."

I rolled my eyes.  I hated to be reminded that her record was better than mine.  Kills counted better than a capture.  Most Venatori didn't capture they just took out their marks.  "Good for them."

Jace frowned and looked down and when he looked back up he was smiling.  "Come on.  I know what will help everyone."  Jace looked across the room.  "You feel like jumping?"

Did I ever.  Jace was right, that would help.  Beating my fears back with a stick only worked so far, conquering them on the other hand was a whole knew feeling and I hadn't done it in a very long while.  I grinned at Jace and he laughed.  "I thought so."

"Alright, everyone grab your jackets we are going to the roof."

Dorian looked at me with concern.  I put my hand on his shoulder.  "It'll be glorious.  Trust me.  I will feel better."

Dorian's look didn't change as we lead the class up to the roof.  Levi seemed to be missing.  Fuck!  I looked around and couldn't see him.  Where did he go?

Dorian looked behind me to see what was wrong.  "Damn it.  This is one of the things his mentors get pissed at."

I shrugged.  "What harm can he do?  He's not a child.  We'll find him later.  I need to do this."

Dorian nodded. "Are you sure?  It sounds dangerous."

"I laugh in the face of danger." I laughed in a fake villianouse voice.  It made Dorian smile.  The kids closes to us giggled.

We took the elevator to the top floor.  I didn't hesitate to stand against Dorian and taken in his comforting scent as we rode up to the top floors.  Jace elbowed me in the back and whispered, "Way to go."

Dorian chuckled in my ear then asked, "You do know we've a history right?"

I nodded and whispered back, "Yes. His last fling before getting back with Mia forever.  I couldn't forget that."

Jace asked.  "Does it upset you?"

I shook my head.  "I never had a problem sharing with you Jace.  Though now..." I turned to look at Jace with a grin. "Mine."

Jace laughed as the door dinged open and the children filed out and started for the stairs to the roof.

Dorian and were the last ones out and he stopped me with a hand on my wrist. "You really aren't worried or upset?"

I shook my head.  "No.  It's not news to me.  I was miffed at the time he told me.  But I'm okay with it."

Dorian asked, "Mine?"

I smiled.  "It was something we did when we were younger and were aiming to nail the same person."

"Alwyas so crude?"

"Sorry.  I'll try to pharse it more delicately next time, but it wasn't about the sentimental stuff - not ever."

Dorian asked, "And now?"

I kissed Dorian descretely on the lips, I didnt linger.  I whispered as I pulled away, "Whatever you want, you get."

Jace called down from the stair well, "You two coming?"

I looked to Dorian.  "We can finish this later.  I know you won't forget.  That's four things we need to talk about."

Dorian said.  "Five."

"Five?  What am I missing?"

"You aren't.  But I have something else to ask you later."

I nodded.  "Anything.  And I will be completely honest."  

"I know."

I went up the stairs two at a time, Dorian not so fast.  Once we reached the top the wind was blowing softly and the kids were all wrapping their arms around them.  It felt refreshing.

Dorian stood back by the door.  I stepped carefully towards to edge.  The last time I imagine Dorian was up here was the day I saved him when he fell.  I looked back at him and he was leaning against the wall near the door watching me with those deep blue eyes.  I smiled back at him and he returned it, though it never reached his eyes.  He didn't want to be up here.  

I took Jace aside.  "Tell Dorian to meet me downstairs while I prepare.  I won't be back up after I jump.  Levi took off I need to find him."

Jace nodded and went to do as I asked.  The children chattered behind me.  Jace yelled.  "Make it a spectical."

I had already planned on it.  I took a deep breath about 10 steps away from the ledge I was about to jump off.  I put up a veil around the entire AU building and I heard Jace whistle.  "Damn, you've been practicing."

I shrugged.  "I always held back before."  I held the viel in place and a caphony of weaves circled the entire enclosure.  Reds and blues danced with yellows and brown.  It was the same chaotic symphomy of patterns that I'd used on Levi earlier.  I looked back and I saw Dorian standing in the doorway watching in stunned awe.  When he looked at me I grinned at him and looked forward and ran those ten steps and dove over the edge.  I could hear the wail of the children but it was soon drowned out by the wind whipping past my ears.  

Wings of air formed around me and I sent softening patterns to the ground below.  It always reminded me of the scene in the matrix when Neo bounced off the pavement.  It wasn't really a bounce for me, but it's how I envisioned it when I first created it.  It was an 8 second drop to the ground and it was pure bliss.  

There was nothing but me and the world around me.  Nothing but conquered fears and my ego gloating over defining my innate senses.  

I landed on the soft green grass and I rolled over and held my thumbs up.  I couldn't see Jace leaning over the edge, but I knew he was.  I could look but I didn't have to extend my vision.  I just knew.

I lay on the grass staring up at the swirling syphony and I started to hear a mass of people chattering.  I looked behind me while still laying on the ground.  The world was upside down, but there were Magnus and other Venatori standing on the pavement watching me.  I grined and I let the veil fall and with it the symphony died and exploded into tiny particles that floated to the ground and disappeared.  Specitcal it was.

I heard the alley door open and I saw Dorian standing there holding the door.  I got up and turned towards the lingering crowd and gave a flourishing bow.  I couldn't make out what anyone inparticular was saying but I heard a few girls giggling.  I headed for the door and the caphony of voices rose.  Dorian held the door for me and we stepped back inside the quiet of the empty stairwell.

Dorian grabbed my wrists and pushed me up against the wall and kissed me with passion, so much passion it almost hurt.
