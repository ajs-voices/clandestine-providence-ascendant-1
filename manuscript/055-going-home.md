## Going Home

As usual my nightmares came and woke me up but I didn't want to move with the woman drapped over me sleeping like a baby.  I wasn't in a rush, It wasn't like I felt the need to get up and run.  I hadn't run in over a month.  I hadn't worked out.  I felt it too.  I would get back on track once my life became a schedule again.  At least a human schedule not someone inhuman without a real job and a life.

I could sound pitiful and hate the way my life was but I had done it to myself.  My anxiety the first few weeks was through the roof.  But I never let depression set in.  I felt sorry for myself, but then I'd remember I made the decision.  I fell and now the CCB was going to lift me back up.  Already it was feeling better.

There was a knock at the door and I lifted Jo's arm from my chest and put it over the pillow, she pulled it closed with a murmur and slipped back into her slumber.  I answered the door in my boxers.  

Adrian looking a little bit worse for wear was standing buttoning his shirt in front of me when I pulled the door open.  I gave him a knowing grin.  "Have fun?"

He winked at me.  "Jo get here alright?"

I nodded, "She's sleeping."

He looked past me into the room, "With you?"

"It wasn't like that."  

Adrian grinned at me.  "I know.  She's pack.  When I told her she was going with you her mood picked up.  Whatever you did to her that connection is strong.  Even Leah couldn't get her to sit with her."  Adrian leaned in sniffed my skin.  He leaned back with a wide smile.  "Touch is important to our kind.  But it alwasys was for you too.  I mean how else could you sleep with a hot guy like Jason Hill and not have sex with him?"

I grinned, "It wasn't easy."  I lied because it was easy, Jace was like my brother.  I loved him, but not the way he wanted me to.  I sighed and looked back behind me.  "I don't know how to do this, Adrian."

"Do what?"

"Be this." I waved my hand back at Jo.

He smiled.  "You are doing perfect.  Better than most Alpha's.  She's family Nox.  That's all you have to remember."

Elena stepped out of her room carrying a small bag and smiled happily at me in her navy blue suit dress.  Even with the navy high heels on she only came up to my arm pits.  She pulled Adrian down by his shirt and kissed him hard.  Adrian's lips were painted red from her lipstick.  He fought the urge to kiss her again before he turned and left with a salute.  "Fare thee well Nox Setanta and I wish you a hearty hunt."

I smiled.  "Right back at ya Adrian."

Elena laughed.  "You know what is right?"

I nodded.  "I've been around enough pack yes.  I know what it means.  It's a traditional farewell when someone is going away for a while - usually to their death."

"And you don't think it's slightly ironic?"  she asked.

"Depends on how you look at it."  I stepped inside my room leaving the door open for Elena to come in.  "I'll wake Jo up and we'll get ready."

Elena sat down on the undisturbed bed, "Not a rush darling."

I was already shaking Jo's shoulder.  "Jo.  Time to take a shower, we need to go."

She rubbed her eyes and frowned and covered her head with the pillow.  I grinned, "Fine then I'll shower first."

I tossed Elena the remote as she kicked back on the bed.  She smiled at me as she pulled out a book from her bag.  "You slept with her?"

I shrugged.  "It felt right.  I'm going to shower."

Elena nodded to my head, "Change the color.  Crimson suits my needs today."

I nodded.  "Yes ma'am."

I showered and fixed the color of my hair.  It was easier to remove the color first and then add in new streaks.  It was only crimson red today.

I walked out in just the towel and shook Jo's shoulder.  "Now, babe.  Up and at 'em or I'll stuff you in a cold shower."

She hurmped and pulled her small self out of bed and staggered into the shower.

I stood in front of the closet full of clothes and tried to decide what to wear.  I decided upon the jeans from last night a crimson t-shirt under a black button up shirt.

Elena stood behind me and took the dress shirt from me, "Why do you always wear long sleeves?"

She tossed it to the bed and handed me a leather jacket that looked like something James Dean might wear.  It was dark brown and didn't match I looked at her with confusion.  "This doesn't go with anything I chose."

She grinned.  "I forget, gay man."

"I'm not gay." But I smiled as I said it, I knew she was saying it to poke fun at me.

"Are you going to answer me?"  Elena asked handing me a black blazer.

"What's wrong with the shirt?"  

She looked at me, "You wore the same outfit yesterday in a different color."

"And?"

"Darling..."  she sighed, "You look five."

I laughed.  "Elena.  I'm not pulling out the sweats and hoodies just for you."

"As if you'd wear sweat pants."

"Maybe not but I could.  What's wrong with the long sleeve shirts.  I'm being presentable in something I can tolerate.  The backs of my arms are covered in scars, I'd rather not have to explain them or hide them.  Sleeves make it easier."

She sighed.  "Fine. Fine.  Be logical."

I smiled, "What's wrong with the shirt?"

"Choose another color."

I asked her, "What color would you like?"

"The color of your hair."

I smiled and took the black shirt off the bed and changed it.  It was the same principle as I'd done to my hair.  It just took a little longer as I rewound the fibers of color into the right orders.  

She stood slack jawed as I pulled the crimson red button down shirt over top the black t-shirt I wore yesterday.

"Darling, tell me, could you have fed yourself, and cleaned the clothes you wore and hell made your own?"

I nodded.  "Yes.  The food would taste like dust, because flavor is not replicated but the sustinance would have been the same."

"Why the fuck didn't you?"

"I wouldn't be here if I did."

She laughed.  "You played us as much as we played you.  You want to be here?"

I shook my head.  "I don't know if here is where I'm supposed to be.  But I trust that it's the right place as I fell.  I could have hit rock bottom, but I didn't.  I could have gotten back into my old life.  Been that guy again.  I could have gone on living through the charity of others because I was that good.  But I made a choice.  And here is where I am.  I don't intend to fall again, Elena."

"Good Nox.  Good!"

Jo came out wearing the same clothes as yesterday. Elena raised her eyebrow.  "You wore that yesterday!"

Jo rolled her eyes.  "For like two hours."

"She's fine Elena."  I took Jo's hand and grabbed the stuff on the desk that Elena had given me.  "What's going to happen to the clothes?"

"It'll stay here for the next tall thin man we recruit."

"Good it's mostly hideous."

Elena nodded.  "Yes, it is."

I opened the door and offered Elena my other arm which she gratefully took.  And we went home.
