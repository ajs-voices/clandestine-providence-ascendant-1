## Taking a Stand

I woke as usual with nightmares this time I was looking at my own death and how many people it would affect.  Isabel was wrapped around me, both of us still naked from our romantic wedding.  I unfurled from her and pulled on a pair of boxers and jeans before leaving to go outside to the garden.  My phone beeped with a text message and I looked down to see the word 'move'.  I took a side step and in the shadows Il Cane presented herself among the rose bushes.  

The small vampire crouched in the bushes and looked up at me as I towered above her.  I sat on the cold wet grass and smiled at the dark eyes beauty before me.  Ant was a more masculine version of his mother, and he was beautiful.  She spoke softly, "You will adhere to the bargin, Ascendant."

I nodded.  "If I die, you will protect my people as one of your own?"

She nodded.  "If you live, you come when I call for eternity."

I nodded and held out my wrist to the Hound.  She actually smiled, her fangs glinting in the night as they sank into my wrist.  There was a brief moment of esctasy before it faded into the dull ache of wanting.  I drifted in the moment thinking of Dorian and Isabel and how complicated things could become.  But I would save them both!

Cari let go and frowned.  "Spiraling into the depths of love?"

I smiled.  "You have no idea."

Cari nodded, "I do.  Tony is not always easy to love nor I'm sure you can surmise am I."

"But he does - love you."

"Yes.  And I him in my own way."

"Thank you Cari."

Cari bowed her head slightly, "It's is my honor to serve."

I bowed my head, "As it is mine.  I will come when you call until the day I die."

Cari smiled, "Do not die too soon, Ascendant."  And with those parting words she was gone the same way she came.

Morning came and I had Emily make breakfast as I left for the main compound where I knew James was.  I left alone, but I knew people had followed.  I could feel them trailing me.  It wasn't threatening, it was a solid backing.  My pack had my back even though they would regret it if I made the wrong choice.

But when I walked up to the compound door the entirety of my pack waited.  They parted, those closest to me patting my back or touching my arm.  It was a show of support.  I wondered how much they had been told and how much had come through the bond we all shared.  I was not werewolf, but I was still their Alpha.  Even those I knew who didn't like me were standing with me.

To my surprise there were others here as well, Ant and Marco stood in the shadows.  Il Cane was not too far as I saw Ryan standing among the people in the crowd.  Her chevalier never traveled far from her sight. 

I walked into the main doors of the compound and there was a sort of hushed silence as I opened the doors to James' office.  A note proped on the desk with my name on it sat in plain sight.

[i]Rec room.[/i]

He knew my answer.

I walked to the rec room and pushed open the doors.  The room was filled with members of the CCB lining the walls.  My pack followed behind me and James smiled.  "I take it your decision has been made.  I didn't figure you'd come here.  Your loyalties lying with your beloved."

"They can take care of themselves.  I'm responsible for these here."

James nodded.  "I expected nothing less of you."

From behind James Garrett stepped weilding air and earth around him like he was some sort of giant octopus.  I froze at the sight of my demon in the flesh.  He even mimic the imagary bestoying upon himself red eyes of fire.  Illusion.  He had tormented me years upon  years with those images.  I felt fingers slip into mine and the fear vanished.  Isabel looked up at me with fire in her eyes.  She said nothing but she grounded me.  

I made it no pretense as I crafted a fire circle around Garrett and let him watch as it slowly filled in as he tried to fight it off.  I watched as my magic poured into him and his skin light on fire.  The air soon stank of burning hair and flesh and the sounds of his screams were the only thing that could be heard.  Garrett begged James to help him, but James just laughed at him.  "One does not hurt the children of the pack."

I snapped Garrett's neck with a weave of air and he fell to the floor and the fire vanished in a fog of steam and the smell of the earth I'd used to douse it.

James smiled. "Good my boy.  And now?"

I smiled in return but I didn't get a chance to challenge him as Charles stepped in front of James.  "I challenge you to leadership of your pack.  Fight me like wolf not your tricks."

James sighed.  "Charles..."

I interrupted.  "I accept those terms."

Isabel squeezed my hand and I walked to the middle of the room.  It wasn't a fair fight.  But I had my pack at my back.  I was safe in the knowledge the Iasabel would keep them safe with Cari's help.  And Dorian would be safe.  I didn't care if I died.  If I coud die...

There was a ringing of a bell in the distance and Charles launched at me with snouted face and claws for hands.  I could only use what I had at my arsenal.  Which amounted to nothing but my hands.  James frowned when he saw I intended to fight as Charles had asked.  With a nod I saw various weapons slide out on to the floor around us.  One slide to my feet and I picked up the sword.  I recognized it as Ants.  The blade was old and of Japanese descent.  One of the first samari sword ever taken from Japan's soil.  I picked it up and smiled.  Ant and I had sparred with swords once upon a time with this very sword.  I'd run him through the heart by accident.

Charles hadn't given me any time to unsheath the sword but it didn't matter as I rolled out of the way unsheathing the sword as I did, standing in one fluid motion.  I was taught to fight those stronger and faster than I was.  I was handicapped from the beginning.  But I had training and I fell back up on that training and I let the memories of my childhood dance through my veins.

The pack magic amplified my senses.  The sword danced in my hands as we played a game of cat and mouse.  The sound of the battle was the only thing in my ears as I felt Charles' jaws clamp shut on my sword arm and the sword clattered to the ground.  He howled in victory as I fetched another weapon with my left hand.  It was clumbsy and awkward but Charles rushed me head down intending to take me to the ground.  I used both hands and as Charles stepped in front of me like a baseball bat i swung the club and felt his skull shatter as brain matter splattered everywhere.

His momentum carried me backwards and I crashed into the wall behind me gasping for breath.

I could hear the whooping and cheering of my pack around me.  I pulled myself off the wall and back around to where James was standing with a small smile on his face.  Elena was collapsed against Isabel, tears streaming down her face.  When she looked up and saw me watching her she gave me a small smile and a brief nod.  I felt her join the pack.

I turned back around to look at James.  He nodded.  "You have my word.  If you survive the detonation will not happen."  James raised his voice.  "Is that understood!  If I fall you do not press the button anyway."  He looked at me.  "Well?"

"James Wright, I challenge you to the leadership of the Creed of Celestial Beings and everything under it."

He nodded.  "I will not make the same demands as Charles.  Only that it be an honorable fight."

I nodded, "Clear the weapons."

James looked at me with a quizical look.  When all the weapons returned to their owners I made weaves of earth air and fire around my hands and jaws.

James laughed with a nodded.  "I accept."  He shifted his hands into claws and jaws with sharp teeth.

I could feel the stiching of my skin from the wounds Charles had given me and there were small stabs of pain lancing through me as the werewolf venom was fighting against my healing ability.

I moved slowly as James circled me.  Neither one of us wanting to make the first move.  I heard Elena cry out, "Big babies!  Fight already!"

We both chuckled to ourselves as we both stepped into a grapple.  I could feel Jame's claws digging into my arms.  It was a searing sort of pain.  I could feel the blood dripping to the ground as he tossed me to the side sending me crashing into the ground and losing my breath.

He was on top of me before I knew it and the only thing I could do was block the blows that came at my face.  I felt my arms shreading and the blood dripping down on to my face.

The pack rallied with me giving me the strength to push back.  James didn't move much but I used that little bit to send my arm and the makeshift claws into James stomach as hard as I could.  I felt the moment I hit his skin, I could feel the weaves of air slicing into his intestines and the blood flowing from the wounds as I drove my hand through his body.  I grabbed his spine and he crumpled in pain as I pulled my arm free.  He collapsed to the side with part of his spine still in my hand.

There was nothing but silence in the rec room as the magic that bound James to every being under the CCB umbrella fell to me.
