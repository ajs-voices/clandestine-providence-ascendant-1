## Rogue Wolf

The rest of the day Auto showed me around and taught me how to use the computer system for inventory.   That night I made dinner for the entire clan. It was the first time I cooked for so many people. Elena was there early and watched as I learned my way around the incredible kitchen and made chicken florentine with a toss salad.  

This was how I spent the next week. I'd wake up, do my first workout and then make breakfast everyone.  I'd make lunch and pack them for those who wanted one, then head out the door.  I would do inventory for half the day then Auto would teach me all about the auto mechanic business.  But mostly I did the inventory and learned about the insides of cars.  I took two one hour breaks, eating lunch and small workout on the first then a full workout on the second - usually a nice long run.  When work was over I would make dinner, do another work out then pass out. 

I was still waking up from my nightmares always afraid for those I loved.  Dorian's life was always the one that woke me up.  I hurt every morning feeling his loss.  After one particularly bad one I decided I need to see him.  I knew it was too early but I sent Dorian a text.  I sent him my schedule and a note saying I'd like to talk.  I laid awake several hours but he never returned my text.  It was too early to wake up but I started my day anyway.  

By the end of my day I still hadn't heard from him.  I knew he was fine, but life moves on and I wouldn't dwell on it.  But there was really little time to do that.  It was three nights before the next full moon and Paul and the other wolves were decided where the best hunt would be while I finished the last of dinner.  Micahel, Paul's oldest son rushed into the sitting room they were using frantic.  His words were chopped and ragged while he tried to catch his breath. "Raf is changing in the middle of central park."

Paul shot up like a weed from his chair and looked at the men and women in the room, then looked at me.  "You have to help.  He's just a boy.  Before your friends find him."  Paul said your friends with a venom I hadn't heard from him when talking about the Venatori before it made me wonder what exactly might have happened in his past to hate us, but he didn't seem to mind me.

I wiped my hands and looked at Michael.  "Where is he exactly?"

Michael gave me the location he'd last seen his best friend.  I took my phone out and called Ant.  

He picked up, "Hey Nox, what's up?"

"Can you take me some place I don't have time to explain."

Paul took my phone from me and threw it across the room.  "We don't need vampire help."

He rushed out the door followed by his friends.

I used a pattern of air and retreivd my phone as I saw Ant walking in the front door with a sword of fire in his hands.  "It's alright, Ant.  But I stil need that help."

He only nodded as the flame disappeared.  "Let's go then."

We walked outside and he took my arm.  The shift always made me sick but I fought the feelings down.  I could hear the howling of a wolf near by.  It was too early for a change, but from what I understood it happened on occassion.  

Ant grabbed my shoulder again.  "You need help?"

I shrugged.  "I've talked down one wolf in my life not sure exactly how that happened.  But we can't kill him."

"Wouldn't dream of it."  Ant smiled at me.  "But you aren't doing it alone."

"Thanks."  We ran towards the growling, and where people were fleeing.  There wasn't many but wolves in the park that was dangerous and the city folk didn't want to be there.  Which was good.

We found Raf stalking something in the shadows.  I threw a rock in the general vacinity of him and he turned towards us.  Ant circled around behind him.

"Rafael, it's alright man.  Calm down. "  I wove walls of air around him and funneled him towards me.  I held out my hand and he sniffed the air and howled.  But he took a tenative step towards me.  I knelt down and kept my hand out.  Rafael's wolf was larger than I was, it was too dark to really tll what color he was, but his ambers eyes shown in the dim light from the moon.  He continued towards me with a low rumble in his throat.  

I thought about Jo and Rafael's attention changed.  He took another step towards me.  "Rafael, it's alright.  Calm down.  We got this."  He stepped into my hand and sniffed it before he pressed into it.  The rumbling died down and the large wolf pressed his head against my chest.  

I rubbed his head and the back of his neck and smiled.  Ant laughed softly behind the large wolf.  "Ain't you got talent."

A crowd of people stopped around us and I heard Paul telling them to go home.  I stared at Ant with hatred.  Raf laid down next to me and I rubbed behind his ears.  "Ant is my friend Paul, he isn't just any vampire."

"What did you do?"  He fell to his knees next to his son's best friend.

"I didn't do anything.  I was just here."

A man stood behind me and put his hand on my shoulder.  "As any good Alpha is." I looked up to find Adrian standing behind me.  "That's two now."

Paul stood up, "He was not meant for you Nox."

I frowned.  "Then maybe his would be Alpha should have been keeping better tabs on him."  I stood up and Rafael's wolf form followed me and Ant as we left.

Paul grabbed my arm and turned me towards him.  There was sadness in his eyes, "Thank you, Nox."  

I smiled.  "I am not like them, Paul.  I will save whoever I can however I can."  

The walk from Central Park was a lot longer than the journey to.  Ant left shortly after we started walking.  He said he had to prepare for the day's ambush.  War would start tomorrow if I couldn't talk my father down.  I took a day off.  Auto was more than happy to give me the day.

That night I slept in the family bed room with Raf and Jo curled around me.

I had a new nightmare one that I screamed as I boled awake.  Raf and Jo looked startled as I laid back down to conformt them.  Raf was back in his human form looking around groggy.  Jo was whispering in his ear and Raf was nodding.  I got up out of the family bed and headed out for a run.  

Before I was out the door Raf was dressed and joining me.  "I'm coming with you."

"Just going for a run."

Raf smiled.  "I know.  You are my Alpha now, right?  I mean I feel it.  You don't get to run with us so we are going to run with you."

Jo's hand slipped into mine as she joined us.

"Keep up then."  I really didn't have any doubts that they would, but they were werwolves after all, and I only had human speed.
