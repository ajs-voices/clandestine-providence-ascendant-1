## Jumping the Ambush

Raf pretty much refused to leave my side the entire morning.  He helped me make breakfast and cleaned everything up for me.  As I was finishing the last of my coffee I said to Raf, "You don't have to follow me around. You have a life, I have a life and where I'm going next you can't come with me.  You are a kid, and this is dangerous."

"I'm not a kid."  Raf protested.

"You are.  And I can't let you come with me.  Raf, if the Venatori do what they are planning, there will be a war.  And we don't need the were's involved.  Ant won't hurt you and Marco probably not, but Bernstein he might.  And my father and Emilio probably don't care.  Please don't come with me."

Jo laughed.  "Just order him not to go."

I gave the small brunette a dirty look.  "I can't do that.  I won't do that.  We all have free will."

Jo frowned, "Adrian says that is not how Alpha's act.  Alpha's take control, they are control."

I laughed.  "No Duckling, that's Adrian."  I leaned closer to her and whispered, "He likes control, he's very into tying people up and spanking them."  I walked over to Raf and put my hand on his shoulder.  "I'm not going to order you anything.  But if you follow me and you get hurt it's all on you."  I walked out of the room with Jo still glaring after me for disrespecting the only Alpha she knew.  But it was completely the truth and she just didn't beleive me.

The meeting was supposed to take place in an abandoned subway station.  Someplace neutral, but not really, anything underground was vampire territory and if my father had paid any attention to the natural order of the city he'd have know that and not agreed to it.

When I arrived there were already vampires hiding in the tunnels, in the shadows, Ant and Bernstein were standing on the platform.  

I heard footsteps on the stairs behind me and saw my father and Emilio walking down.  My father was weilding fire around him.  He looked at me and frowned, "You can't be here boy."

"Yeah, see.  I don't follow **your** rules anymore Dad."  I threw a wall of fire between the two parties.  "See, you have enough fire power around you to scorch the place.  I bet the area is surrounded and you think the vampires came alone."

"Ant is the son of Il Cane.  He's got all sorts of vampires at his beck and call.  Tat can come in at the right signal.  Bernstein's men are hidding in the shadows."

"You are going to start a war."

Ant was smiling at me and my dad frowned at him.  "How did you hear about this Nox?"

"I have all sorts of connections.  Don't you know?  I'm Exuli Kai.  People talk to me."

Emilio frowned.  "I guarantee you Dorian told him."

"Actually no he didn't.  I received a note from someone else.  I've not spoken to Dorian since the night before I was exiled and we didn't exactly do much talking."

Emilio laughed, "I don't want to hear about your sex life, Nox.  Though Dorian's moved on, son.  You should too."

"Good for Dorian."  I said with a smile but inside it felt like my heart was being ripped out.  But at least now I knew why he wasn't contacting me back.

"Let's talk this out, or leave.  They didn't kill those people.  And you aren't going to kill them now.  I won't let you."

"Get out of the way Nox."  Kai squelched the flames in front of him.

I just grinned at him as a wall of air formed around the vampires and filled with smoke.  Bernstein cackled.  "Ant leave with your people now, I don't want any blood shed today."

"I will take mine, but I cannot vouch for Bernstein."  Ant echoed in the emptiness before he vanished into the shadows.

Bernstein laughed.  "Boy, why should I do what you ask.  They come to kill me.  I'd love very much to kill them."

"You owe me."  I said flatly.  But my father started throwing fireballs at the wall of air.

"He is persistant.  Your father."  He laughed.  "But this is over the debt I owe you, boy."

"Yes, and I will owe you if you leave today."  I promised.  "My word is my law."

"Oath's boy mean nothing from Venatori."  Bernstein sneered.

"I am not Venatori.  I give you my word on my honor and on those who I love."

The firing pounding on the shield of air around Bernstein.  "Fine boy.  You owe me one very large favor."

"Done."  I looked at my father as I let the wall of air fall and my father's fire flew through the smoke and scattered on the far wall.  "They are gone now.  Your quarry has run and you will not follow where they went Father."

Kai turned on me with fury and raised an arm to throw a fireball at me.  "You truly are a traitor."

"Call me all the names you like Father.  You will not start a war I can prevent.  Take your Venatori and hunt another night."  

Kai threw a fireball which I let stop inches from my face with a wall of air.  "Dad,.." I started to say.

"Don't call me that."  Kai yelled at me, "You are no son of mine."

"I finally call you Dad and you don't like it.  How ironic."  Kai threw more fireballs at me. Emilio tried to pull him up the stairs, but he shrugged his best friend off as the flames battered my shield of air.  I could feel the wall failing, the heat burning at my skin.  The next three balls of fire came at me with rapid succession.  One, the wall weakened to near collapse, the second and it fell without warning as the third one explode against my chest and everything caught instanteously on fire.  

I could hear the roar of the flames in my ears, I could feel the searing of my lungs as I took a breath and tried to scream.  Through the flames I saw my father fall to his knees in despair.  I could hear his scream of pain mingling with my own.  The pain was like nothing I had ever felt.
