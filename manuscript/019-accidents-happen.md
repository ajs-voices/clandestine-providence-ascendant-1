## Accidents Happen

We went the long way to the gym.  I'm not sure if Dorian was prolonging it or if he was just letting me wander, but it doesn't really matter.  I stopped at the door to the gym and stepped aside as someone was exiting.  Dorian kissed me good-bye there were no words just the soft press of his lips and his teeth biting softly into my lip before he parted with a wink.  "Remember stop by when you are done."

I nodded and watched as Dorian walked away from me to go do whatever it was he did.  I entered the gym and changed quickly and left down the stairs outside into the cool New York air.  A storm was brewing I could feel it on my skin, and the sky looked angry in the dim light of dusk.

I ran for about an hour.  It felt good to be back in New York City doing the things I did.  It was a releif to find peace in my surroundings. Not that nature wasn't peaceful, this was just home.  I was a mess more than ever though.  Around every corner I thought I saw Garrett.

I focused on the memory of Dorian, how he smelled, how he felt, his lips against mine.  By the time I was back in the gym hitting the showers my mind was preocuppied with seeing Dorian again.  So preoccupied I didn't notice the veil I didn't put up and a pair of teenage boys were staring at the scars on my back.  Soon as I turned around they bolted out the door knocking over a bucket of mops and brooms in the corner.

I sighed and turned off the water and wrapped my towel around me and headed for the locker I was using.  I sat down and started rifling through my bag of things to find something comfortable to wear I was tired of the monkey suit.  I found another pair of shorts and a semi-decent t-shirt.  It at least didn't say anything inappropriate, and it matched with the shorts, both a dark shade of red.  The shirt read "I'd hit that" with a picture of a pinanta underneath it.  

A voice spoke behind me as I mused about the shirt.  "I'd hit that?  Really?  You haven't grown up at all."

I didn't turn to see my father standing next to an opened locker pulling a t-shirt over his head.  "Nope I have not."

He sat down next to me but faced the other way and pulled on his sneakers.  "Those scars?  You want to talk about them.  They aren't career related."

"No I don't actually."

Kai put his hand on my shoulder as he stood up, there was only a little uncomfortalbe weight added to my body as he stood.  "If you do.  I'd love to hear the story.  Beat the shit that hurt you."

I stood up and pulled my shirt over my head and my boxers and shorts on before I said anything as I turned to face my father.  "You care now?"  It sounded sharp and bitter.  It was rude.  I closed my eyes and swallowed my pride.  "I'm sorry.  That was uncalled for.  You didn't know."

"I would have then and I do now.  Son, we are too alike that's why we butt heads.  You are more like me than any of my other children and it's frightening because it comes from the same upbringing.  Don't get lost in the anger."  He didn't stay any long as he headed off into the depths of the gym to hunt down whatever workout he was going to do.  

I sighed and finsihed dressing and packing up my things.  I was about to head to the stairs when I heard the fire alarm go off.  It squelched five times with a short pause then gave the location.  I headed towards the archives at least that's what I thought it said.  Why would anyone be bending in the archives?  And then I thought about it - another bomb...

I took the stairs three at a time and by the time I reached the right level i was sweating and breathing heavy from the added exersion.  There was a crowd milling around in every cooridor.  I had to talk my way through things with my back pack slung over my shoulder.  My father was already up here and he was stepping up to block my passage.  "No."

"No?"

Kai pushed me back they way I'd come.  "I said No."

"Why the fuck not? I can help." I was bristling with anger I could feel the blood rushing through my body hotter than when he'd interrupted me before.

"Nox, just no."

"Let me pass Kai." 

I tried to shove my way through when one of the medics grabbed my wrist.  "I need him."  He lead me around the corner. "Whatever you did last time, I need you to do it again."

I blinked at him and then I remembered him, he was one of those who'd watched me heal Nick.  I nodded, "Alright."  I turned to look a the broken body in front of me and I froze.  Dorian lay on the gurny in front of me, 3/4 of his body was burnt, his face, the pretty clothes were all char and I could clearly see the tattoo on his chest through it.  The medic pushed me, "Come on man, we got another one."

I blinked again and grabbed Dorian's hand.  "I got you.""  I let my powers flow through me into him.  I wove patterns of all the elements and let them settle over his whole body as I fed his body the strength he needed to heal himself.

I could see the wounds knitting closed as I did.  I could feel the weakening it was doing to my body.  "Where is the second one?  Bring them here.  I'll not be strong enough later."

The medics listened and Nox saw what was a pretty woman lying on another gurny the resemblence to Dorian was uncanny.  Fuck!  I held her hand and I fed her the same energy.  I split the pattern two ways.  I could feel my own energy levels depleting.  I could feel my legs giving way and I fell to my knees.  I heard a voice behind me, "You need to stop."  I shook my head.  No there was still too much damage.

I gave them both everything I had and darkness overcame me only moments later.

I tried to open my eyes but they still felt heavy, my whole body felt heavy.  There was a faint scent of vanilla and cinamon lingering in the air.  I rested in the comfort of the smell until I felt the weight lifting.  I tried to sit up and open my eyes at the same time, but I couldn't move.  That was when I noticed hands where pressing medown.  Voices were speaking, "Hold him down.  We have to get the needle in."

It was a gut reaction - needles were one of my biggest fears and I hadn't meant to but I expanded my presense and pushed people away with a gust of hard air.  There were no hands on me anymore.  There was buzzers going off all over and my head started to pound.

A woman, a voice I barely recognized was touching my arm.  "It's okay Nox.  Calm down.  We need you to calm down."  I sat up unhindered this time and blinked at everyone in the room.  I didn't recognize anyone.  

"What's going on?"

The same woman touching me looked up at me from her small stature and smiled.  "You passed out.  We need to give you nourishment."

"I'm awake now so you don't need to put an IV in my arm."

She nodded, "Yes we do.  Please?"

"No".  It came out much louder than I had intended.  Someone cleared their throat in the doorway and I looked up to see Dorian dressed in a hospital gown and dressings all over the place.  Fuck!  The memories flooded back.  I remember seeing Dorian burnt and dying - his mother too.

Another nurse was abruptly upon Dorian before he could say anything as we looked at each other.  "Mr. Vega, go back to bed he's fine.  See he's awake now."

He smiled and swated the woman away as he hobbled towards me with an IV bag hanging from a rolling pole.  I frowned.  "You okay?"

He nodded.  "Thanks to you - yes, I'll be fine.  No scars I'm told."

I breathed a sigh of releif, "And the woman?"

Dorian smiled.  "My mother will be fine too.  But you need to let them do this.  Nox, you passed out, your energy is turning in on itself I can see it.  You need more energy than you can consome the normal way.  Please."

I shook my head.  "No fucking way they are sticking me with a needle."

Dorian took my left arm and held it under his and pressed his body against me.  "I will distract him while you do this."

"That's not going to work ..."  I didn't get his name out before he was kissing me.  And not just any kiss, the aggression he showed was primal, there was so much more to the kiss than just a distraction.  The want, the need, the fear... He was worried for me.  I pulled back and they chose that moment to prick my skin with that fucking needle.  My heart raced, my body started to shake and Dorian leaned in again and pulled me into his embrace.
"Shhhh...."  He whispered between breaths and kissing.  

Someone patted my arm and Dorian pulled away.  "Better.  Lay down and behave.  I'll be right here.  You need rest."

I sighed and listened to him.  I did as he instructed trying my best not to look at my arm.  Before Dorian laid in the bed next to him he draped the sheet over my arm, "Better?"

I nodded.  I stared at him from across the way.  His body looked fine, but his eyes said he hurt.  Burns always hurt.  I remebered my own.  Nurses crossed our line of sight and were giving us the look.  But I didn't care I looked at Dorian - watched him.  I wanted nothing more than to soothe his pain.  But he watched me with the same intense gaze until we were left alone in the room with the beeping monitors.

Dorian smiled.  "You have a habit of saving my life, you know that?"

"It's worth it."  I grinned at him.  I was feeling sleepy.  

Dorian started humming softlyand I started to sink deeper into sleep.  I started to ask what they did to me but I was gone before the first word hit my mouth, but I could hear the soft melody I had hummed to Dorian earlier and between that and the soft scent of vanilla and cinaomon I drifted off into a near dreamless sleep.
