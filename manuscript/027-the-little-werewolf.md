## The Little Werewolf

Lunch, dinner, whatever it was was over sooner rather than later and Duke rolled me into the common area with the rest of their group.  He said as he pushed me, "We have arts and crafts today."

"Just like Kindergarden," I joked and the big black man chuckled and I could feel it reverberate in the chair itself.  I was impressed with the man's lung capacity and his sear strength.  It made me wonder why he was here, or why any of them where.  Cliff clearly was seeing things that made people think he was crazy.  I didn't think he was crazy.  But I couldn't prove it, and I wasn't a pschologist.

He pushed me up to a table with a bunch of art supplies, no scissors I noted as I pulled a blank peice of paper over.  Lori sat down next to me and Jo next to her.  The two men took up places at the easel's to paint something.  Nox had never given it a shot, he prefered drawing, it came naturally to him.

I started doodling things I saw around the room.  Lori's hand next to mine, the pattern around Jo, the objects across the room.  It wasn't much just simple sketches.  Jo commented as she glanced at my paper. "You are pretty good."  He hand reached across Lori and put her finger on the sketch of her pattern and asked, "What's this?"

I grinned.  "You."  

"I take that back you are a horrible artist."

I laughed as I sketched her into the blank spaces where her features would go, her hair, the way she was pouting as she watched me finish the drawing.  "It's how I see you, more or less.  The way the patterns move around you."

"I don't get it."

Lori giggled, "He's a Magnus.  He can bend an element."

"Actually I can bend all the elements."  I held my hands in front of me and four balls of identical size and shape formed above my hands.  I'd done it so often as of late that the particular trick was becoming instanteous.  "At the same time."

Lori's mouth feel open in the shape of an O. "He's Cesari."  She snuggled up against my arm and patted it.  "I'm in love."

I laughed as a voice behind me said, "Well that was fast."  I turned to see Madison sitting down on the opposite side of me.  "What will Dorian think?"

I grinned at her.  "Flirting?  I honestly don't know.  He's not said anything yet and I've flirted with several people in front of him."

Lori asked, "Who's Dorian?"

I smiled but Madison answered before I could say anything, "His boyfriend."

I'd have denied it except it had been the precise thing I was going to say.  Though it wouldn't have come out like, you are wasting your time with him, he's gay.

I expected Lori to pull away and pout but she didn't she curled up closer, "I'll love him from afar then."

I laughed again, "Yeah, that's real far away."

She poked me in the ribs and I jerked away too fast hurting my already soure self.  I sighed.  "Be nice."

Lori poked me again and I dropped the ball of water on her head.  "I said be nice."

She pouted now.  Jo laughed. "I like him."

Madison smiled and leaned in to whisper to me.  "I put you in the right place."

I asked, "How so?"

She nodded towards the girls, "They haven't been overly open with anyone we've put to the group.  Cliff and Duke were here before them, and they are like father figures to the girls.  These two are very quiet."

I grined.  "I bring out the best in everyone."

Madison rolled her eyes.  "Alright.  You girls take care of Nox here. But don't get drawn in by this pretty face like I did."

"Oooooh," Lori said.  "You two know each other?"

I nodded. "She was my first."

"Your first what?" Jo asked.

"The first person I slept with - male or female".  It was the truth I spoke there wasn't any point in lying but Madion smacked me in the arm.  "Ho that hurt.  I'm not lying."

Madison rolled her eyes.  "Its for saying it so loud."

Lori asked innocently, "Was he your first?"

The question turned Madison's face the color of the rose pinned to her shirt. She muttered something as she left.  So I answered the question. "No.  I was a pitty..." fuck is what I wanted to say but I opted not to finish the sentence at all let them imply what they wanted.  "I was a too skinny kid who had problems and I was fawning over the same guy she was crushing on at the time.  It was a one off thing.  We never really talked much after that."

Jo asked, "But I thought you liked guys?"

"Why does it seem to be one or the other with most people.  I grinned at the two girls, "I enjoy sex no matter who it's with."

Jo whispered, "But you like one more than the other?"

I shrugged.  "If you made me choose, yeah probably."

Lori laughed, "So choose."

I sighed, "Fine.  If I had to choose one or the other it would at this moment be men.  I like men."

Jo whined, "Why?"

I laughed, "I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you."

Duke laughed behind me.  "Don't get any ideas magic boy."

I turned around and felt my muscle strain with that effor to look at Duke behind me.  "I won't, big man.  I'm firmly in play with someone else."

Cliff added from behind his own canvas, "Ameilia is dissapointed."

"Ah, she can come over anytime Cliff - anytime."

A bell rang and everyone scattered, I caught Jo's arm before she passed me completely.  "Can you take me to my room?"  Jo looked around and saw that the room was empty and sighed.  I asked, "Have you changed yet?"

"What?" Jo asked.

I put my hands on the wheels and stopped us, I grabbed her hand and pulled her so I could look at her, she came hesitantly.  "I know you are a were, have you changed?"

"I don't understand."

I sighed.  "Take me my room, can you stay and talk?"

"Yeah I guess.  Curfew isn't for a few more hours."  Jo wheeled me to my room.

She pushed the door open and pushed me through.  "By the bed please?" I asked.  I didn't think I needed help to move if I was close enough.

Jo obliged me and I lifted myself and literally fell on to the bed with an amazing sprawl.  It hurt so bad.  I tried to pull at my power to heal myself a little but I couldn't hold the stream for long, it was sapping my strength. "This so sucks."

Jo sat down in the chair by the wall.  It was bolted in not that it would matter if I really wanted to get violent.  I was suprised I wasn't in a fire-starter room.  I know they had them, I'd been in one before when I was 6.  I pushed those thoughts away and looked across at the brunette staring at me.  

"So what did you want?"

I nodded.  "Tell me how you came to be here?"

"Why?"  Jo sighed, "Oh never mind, I'll tell you.  I came her because a man dropped me off here after he caught me because I had a violent episode - rage induced something or other they said in a store and I hurt some people pretty badly."

I asked, "Was it anywhere near the full moon?"

"How would I know?"  She was about to leave, she was getting up annoyed at my questions.

"Please don't go.  Really I'm just trying to help?  Were you ever bittien by a dog or a wild creature?"

"Yeah.  About two years ago, my parents were killed by the pack of wolves that attacked us.  I was in a foster home until that man told them i would be better of here."

I nodded.  "So you don't know you are a werewolf then?"

"What?"  She didn't beleive me, the sound of her voice was telling me that.  "There are no such thing as werewolves or vampires."

"And there is no such thing as magic."  I could barely muster up a fireworks show from nothing.  She didn't looked impressed, but then I'd done the same earlier.

"It's all just a trick."

"Actually it's all very real.  I'm a Magnus.  You are a werewolf.  Most of the people here aren't overly special except they are Venatori not human.  There are a few exceptions like yourself."

"I don't believe you."  She rolled her eyes and walked out of the room leaving me to my self in the darkness of my room.
