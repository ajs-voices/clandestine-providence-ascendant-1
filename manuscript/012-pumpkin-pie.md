## Pumpkin Pie

We walked through the stair well in relative silence, the echo of our footsteps the only sound.  I don't think either of us knew what to say.  It was fairly clear that this was new territory for both of us.  At least with in the walls of the Venatori.

I broke the silence.  "I need to go to my room and grab my laptop."

Dorian nodded and the silence became deafening.  The awkward moments didn't stop as I stepped inside my room quickly to grab my laptop bag and we started back down the stairs.

When we reached ground level Dorian opened the exterior door and it was like the light changed him.  His hand went for my waist as it had every other time he'd preformed the chivalrous act, but this time instead of removing it once I was clear of the door it remained against my waist for several moments longer until we had to pass through the gap in the gate which  Dorian frowned at me about.  "We can walk around to the front."

I grinned at him.  "What's the fun in that?  This is closer."

We walked across the street waiting for the crossing signal of course, but we still almost got ran over by an errant cabby making an illegal turn.  His fare must be precious.  There was a small hole in the wall dinner around the corner from the Apex building.  Dorian looked at me with concern.  I smiled.  "Trust me."

I opened the door from him and Dorian stepped through with the tinkling bell.  A hearty welcome was shouted from behind the counter.  I stepped in behind Dorian and let the door close behind me.  Dorian took only a few steps inside and I walked into him.  I enjoyed the feel of the length of him against my chest and thighs.  "It's okay, they don't bite."  I whispered, "Not unless you want them to."

Dorian nearly choked.  I stepped around him and took his hand in mind.  A plump waitress looked up as she saw me aproaching and I the smile on her face grow as she welcomed me in with her smile.  Her accent was thick.  She was a clear Brooklynite displaced here in the City now.  "Why isn't it Nox.  Been a long time boy."  She reached across the counter and rubbed the neatly grown goatee on my chin.  "I almost didn't recognize you."

She glanced at my hand holding Dorian's as I asked, "My usual table taken?"

She laughed and looked around.  "Does it look like we are busy?"

I smiled.  "Unsually so.  You have two fine customers waiting service."

She laughed and cleaned her hand on her apron and offered it to Dorian.  "Bonnie.  What brings a fine upstanding citizen like yourself into my establishment with this rabble?"

Dorian let go of my hand and took hers in his to shake.  "He's hungry.  Dorian."

Bonnie stepped around the counter and lead the way to my favorite booth.  It was in the back and away from foot traffic so I wouldn't be disturbed while I studied.  She held out her hand inviting us to sit.  "Just like you left it.  We've missed seeing those books scattered all over the table."

I grinned and dropped a bunch of papers on the table, my folder from earlier.  "I'll bring some memories back for you."

She set two menus on the table and we sat down.  Bonnie indicated she'd be back in a few moments leaving Dorian and I alone for a moment.  Dorian picked up the menu and I watched the face he made.  He then looked up at me, "What?"

"Nothing.  I like watching you."  I could feel heat rising in my chest as I admitted the truth rather easily.

Dorian smiled and went back to reading the menu.  "What's good?"

"The pie."

He put the menu down and dropped a level gaze at me.  "You will eat more than just pie."

"Yes, sir."  I grinned playfully at him.  "I was planning on it but you asked what was good here."

"So nothing else is good?"

I shook my head just as Bonnie appeared from the kitchen and set down two glasses of water full of ice and a bowl of corn chips and salsa.  "Alfred said you better try the salsa."

I looked up at her and nodded.  "Yes ma'am.  I'll have my usual."

She looked to Dorian.  "For you?"

He frowned and then looked back at me.  "Trust me."

Dorian nodded.  "I'll have what he's having."

Bonnie nodded.  "Sounds wonderful, you won't be disappointed."  Bonnie took our order to the kitchen.

I took the spoon from the setting next to me and tried the salsa as I had been instructed.  I tilted my head and shrugged it was alright.  I was missing something.  

Dorian smiled.  "Don't eat corn chips?  Are they offending?" 

I grinned back at him.  "Fried food of most sorts and I don't agree."

Dorian nodded and I could tell he was filing that away for later as he muttered, "I'll have to remember that."

Bonnie returned with freshly made rasberry lemonade with real fruit none of that fake powder shit.  She set a glass down for both of us.  "If the drink is not suited to you Dorian.  Let me know and I'll get you whatever you like."

Dorian looked up at her.  "This is fine, but a chocolate milkshake over there looks divine."

Bonnie raised an eyebrow and smiled.  "A man after my own heart.  Coming right up.  It's been a very long time since Nox had one of these.  I almost have the gall to bring him one too.  But I'm afraid it would just melt."

Dorian nodded.  "I'll get him to try mine."

Bonnie leaned in and whispered.  "His weakness is chocolate I'll be sure to make it extra chocolately."  She got up and smiled at me and then went to make the shake.  She didn't know I had heard.

"You heard that didn't you?"  Dorian asked.

I nodded.  "Extra chocolately."

Dorian chuckled, "She doesn't know what you are?"

I shook my head.  "None of us.  She's a regular old human who's been working here for years.  Her mother owed the joint.  Now she does."

I pulled out my laptop and set it on the table and was thankful all the pictures were in my email when I turned it on.  I didn't want to have to spend the time to upload them from my phone.  

Dorian shook his head.  "Right to work, eh?"

I looked up at Dorian.  "I thought that was what you wanted."

"The case is depressing."  Dorian said flatly.  He smiled.  "Let's talk about you."  A small flash of red crossed his cheeks as he continued.  "How you see the world.  I want to know how you do it."

I smiled.  "I do like talking about myself."

Dorian nodded, "So I've heard."

I laughed.  "You really did go around asking people about me?"

"Yes.  I had a very long conversation with Jason Hill.  He was informative."

"Was he now?"  I was sure Jace was not very informative in the sense that Dorian wanted.

Bonnie stopped at the table and set a foaming and frothy frilly glass of chocolate in front of Dorian and dropped two more straws on the table.  "Here you are sweetie.  I'll go check on your order."

Dorian stuck the straw in the mass of frozen chocholate with chocolate swirls dropped on top to make it look even fancier.  He pushed the drink towards me.  He didn't say anything just stared at me with a knowing smile on his face.

I took a deep breath and took a swollow of the overly sweet concocation.  I was not a big sweets eater but Bonnie was right, chocolate was my only weakness.  It was cold and I had an instant ice cream headache.  But it was divine.  I pushed it back towards Dorian.  He raised an eyebrow, "And?  Would you like to share?"

I shook my head.  "No.  It was good, but it'll ruin my lunch."

Dorian laughed.

Bonnie brought out two plates of pumpkin pie first.  There was a douse of whip cream on them both, one was much smaller and I knew it was mine.  Bonnie had been serving my food for over 20 years she knew exactly what I wanted and how I liked it.

Dorian shook his head, "Ruin your lunch?  Pumpkin pie?"

Bonnie smiled.  "It's his favorite.  And it's protocol to eat desert last.  Thus our not so little rebel here eats it first.  I take it he didn't want more?  Ruin his meal?"  Bonnie rolled her eyes.  "He'll finish the pie, and eat lunch and still be hungry."

"That was along time ago Ms. Bonnie.  I don't eat quite as much as my teenage self did."

I took a bite of the pumpkin pie without any whip cream and closed my eyes.  It was sweet and spicey and perfect.  The texture was smooth and I was in heaven.  I had missed this.

When I opened my eyes Dorian was watching me and Bonnie had left to see to other customers.

"I take it that means it was worth the wait?"

I nodded.  "Yeah.  I missed this."

"Do you want mine?"  Dorian asked.

I shook my head.  "No that's okay.  It'll ruin the rest of the meal."

Dorian laughed.  "You can take it with you then."  He lifted the chocolate milk shake .  "This is plenty enough to ruin my own meal."

I could feel the smile on my face.  I would gladly take the pie home.  Dorian had no idea how much I liked it.  But from the happy grin on his face he was getting the idea.

We didn't speak at all while I enjoyed the pumpkin pie.  I could feel Dorian's eyes watching me take each bite and savor it.  I wondered what was running through his head.  "Penny for your thoughts?"  I looked up to find him stirring the milkshake absently staring at me.

He smiled when my eyes met his.  "Just watching you enjoy."

I put on my best cocky grin and leaned forward so I whispered so only Dorian could hear.  "I'm sure there are more fun things I could let you watch me enjoy."

Dorian's face turned a shade of red I didn't think possible as he looked down.

I took a deep breath and reached across the table and touched Dorian's hand.  "I'm sorry.  My mouth gets away with me sometimes."

He looked up and I could see the lust in his eyes.  "There is no need to apologize.  My thoughts were running a smiliar line."

I cocked my head with a grin.  "Oh really?"  The thought that he wanted me was a huge turn on and I couldn't help but bite my bottom lip.  It was something I rarely did.  More of that shy awkward boy who was new to the whole thing.

Dorian whispered.  "You shouldn't do that."

"Do what?"

"Bite your bottom lip."

"Why?" I asked confused.

"Because it maks me want to bite it, " whispered Dorian in a husky lust filled voice.

My stomach rumbled just was I was about to tell him we could go someplace else.  

Dorian laughed. "I guess that means we stay here a little while longer."

I nodded.  "Guess so.  Rather disappointing."

Dorian put his hand on top of mine.  "Not disappointing.  Prolonged."

I smiled.  There was no question about this.  He wanted me as bad as I wanted him.  

Bonnie chose that moment to bring our lunch to us.  It was a steak with a garden salad as a side and asparagas roasted with lemon and garlic.  I hoped it tasted as good as it smelled and better than I remembered it.

Dorian looked up at Bonnie, "This wasn't on the menu."

"Never is."  She said.  "But he's one of the best regulars we had.  It was a special when he was young and my mother cooked for him.  We still make it for the regulars that remember it."

"I will have to remember that."  He smiled and took a bite of the asparagus and let out a soft moan of enjoyment.  It sents all kinds of feelings through my body.  Dorian said.  "It's delicious.  I can see why Nox likes it here."

Bonnie smiled.  "And for other reasons.  But yes the food is one."

I laughed.  "Go away now."  I added.  "Please."

Bonnie did as I asked but Dorian caught my attention.  He looked like he almost wanted to scold me and I frowned.  "What was the other reason you came here."

"Other than the food and to study? you mean?"  Dorian nodded.  "A guy I was screwing around with worked here."

"Oh."  Dorian started eating and I didn't know what to say now.  I watched him for several minutes trying to think of something to say but I couldn't so I started eating.  As soon as I wasn't looking at him anymore and my fork hit my plate he said.  "Does he still work here?"

I shook my head.  "No.  He hasn't stopped working here when he went to jail."

"Why did he go to jail?"  Dorian sounded shocked.

"He was a pedophile. Got caught."

"How old where you?"  

Dorian was angry now.  I could hear it in his voice and see it in his face when I looked up.  "Old enough to be his victim.  But I wasn't.  I wanted everything we did together."

"Is that why you wanted Bonnie to leave?  So she'd not say anything?"

I shook my head.  "No.  If you asked I wanted to be the one to tell you."

"Why?"

I looked down at my plate and moved the peices of steak around on my plate before I looked back up to met Dorian's eyes.  He was standing up ready to leave.  "I don't beleive in lying to people I want more with."

"More?  What the fuck does that mean to you?"  

Dorian was still standing and I looked down at my plate.  "More means more.  Not just sex.  Not a romp in the sheets.  I want other things than I did when I was home last.  Or here ever.  But my past is full of shit like this Dorian.  If that fact makes you uncomfortable, it's probably best it doesn't go father then this."

Dorian turned and walked away.  I watched him but he didn't go to the door he want into the kitchen and I could hear him and Bonnie talking and Alfredo chiming in every so often but I couldn't make out what they were saying.

I fought the urge to curl up in a ball like I used to do when I was a little boy and be the frightened kid who used to come here and wait for his friend to show up.  I had wanted everything.  He didn't tell me to say that.  I wanted to be loved.  I know that now.  And I know it was abuse and I was a victim.  I know that now.  But Dorian didn't give me a chance to explain myself.

When Dorian returned my plate was clean and my glass was empty.  He sat down, he looked calmer and he started eating.  I leaned against the wall and put my feet on the bench and tried not to pull my knees to my chest.  I wanted to.  It was comforting.

Dorian spoke softly.  "Bonnie explained."

"Did she now?"  I wasn't happy that he went to someone else for information about me.  His research into me was starting to piss me off.

"I didn't know how bad off things were for you as a child." I didn't look at Dorian.  I didn't want to cry.  I didn't want to remember the things I did.  "Bonnie told me, that you were his first vicitim.  She turned him in."

"I know.  I was pissed at her for months."

"Why?"  I could feel the judgement in his voice.

I looked up at Dorian and slammed my feet on the floor and hit my knee in the process.  "Because it was the closest fucking thing I had to love at the time.  Dylan had beaten the shit out of me two weeks prior for kissing him.  My mother left me with a fucking pschyopath and my father could give a flying fuck about me.  I was feeling rejected, and just plain depressed.  He was nice to me, and it was better than slitting my wrists.  He helped me through a difficult time.  He was the first man I had sex with."

"Nox.  He raped you."

"You don't rape someone who wants it.  I don't care if you think I was too young to understand the ramifications.  I understand he abused me.  He hurt me in more ways than one.  He only added to the shit I deal with on a daily basis and its my own fucking fault.  So don't get on your fucking high horse and tell me what happened.  I fucking know.  I've dealt with it.  I've learned from it.  I'm not fucking in therapy so I can sleep on the couch or ramble on about how my life is shitty.  I deal with my fucking problems."

"Maybe you are right?  Maybe this should end here."

I felt the sting of tears in my eyes.  Rejection.  I turned and leaned back against the wall.  "It's not what I want, but if that's what you want. Fine."

"What do you want?"  Dorian's voice was calm and caring and he sounded like he really wanted to know.

I stared out past the end of the booth watching Dorian from the corner of my vision.  He was sitting again and watching me.  I felt the first tear fall.  And before I knew it more were falling.  I wiped angrily at my tears with the back of my hands  Black lines smeared across my hands.  I was going to look like a freak show after this.  Dorian stood up and sat down on my bench and picked up my legs and placed them over his and he moved closer.  His hand touched my cheek and he wiped away the tears.  "Why does that question make you cry?"

I looked down and closed my eyes.  But Dorian lifted my chin with his fingers and wiped away the tears and cleaned the smeared make under my eyes.  I grinned at him.  I didn't want to tell him the answer to either question but I did anyway.  "I want my own family."  It was just a hoarse whisper but I told him my deepest desire. "I want to be safe and loved and wanted."

Dorian asked, "How long did it take you to figure this out?"

"Until recently.  It's why I'm home for a while."

"That's what you meant by more?"  He asked.

I nodded.  The tears stopped flowing and I couldn't look Dorian in the eye.  His fingers pulled my chin in his direction.  "What's wrong?"

I shook my head.  I didn't risk opening my mouth otherwise a sqeaky voice sound off that nothing was wrong.  I hated being weak.  We sat in silence for a long time.  Dorian poked at his plate and I stared off into nothingness thinking about my shitty childhood.  I had only made matters worse most of the time.  

Dorian finally broken the silence and wallowing in self-pity.  "Can I ask you a question?"

I shrugged.  Dorian whispered, "You said your mom left you with a pshycopath.  What did you mean?"

I frowned.  I had blurted that out in the midst of the anger that had risen inside of me and Dorian remembered everything.  If he didn't bring it up now, he'd do so later, so I had better just tell him.  "My first mentor abused me - beat me.  But it's neither here nor there, there is no proof to what I say."

Bonnie stood at the end of the table and frowned.  "Except the scars on his back."  She set down coffee and some water for us and picked up the empty dishes.  "I didn't mean to interrupt.  I'll go now."

Dorian looked at me and stared like he was seeing an alien.  I looked away I didn't want to see his deep blue eyes feeling pity for me.  "Technically, I did that to myself."

Dorian asked, "What do you mean?"

I put my legs back over the bench properly and turned my back to Dorian.  I pulled the dress shirt from the back of my pants and lifted it to show Dorian.  "Technically it was my ability that did that.  He made me hurt myself.  He beat me in my head everyday until I hurt him back."

"A dreamwalker?"

I nodded.  "Yes. I learned how to control my ability though."


Dorian dropped my shirt and turned me around to face him.  "Shit, Nox.  Is there anything else horrible you want to drop?"  He smiled slightly he really didn't want to know more, but he was making a small joke of it.

I smiled back and shook my head.  "Not right now.  That's probably enough for a first date."

Dorian laughed, "Is this a date?"

I smiled.  "You said it was."

"I remember."

I took a sip of the coffee, it was as horrible as I remembered it to be.  I looked over at Dorian and wished this had gone better.  "I need to vent some of this anxiety."
