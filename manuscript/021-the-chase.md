## The Chase

Jace was looking at me with curiousity but he didn't try to stop me when I tried to get up out of the bed I was staying in.  I could feel the weakness in my knees but I managed to stand without too much wobbling.  Jace never once attempted to stop me.  This time no buzzing went off.  I was not connected to any monitors as long as I ate they didn't care about me.

I found my bag put in a corner.  It had been neatly packed - Dorian must have gone through it.  I found my phone lying on top of the clothes inside the bag.  I sat quickly dialed a number and set it to speaker phone.  I didn't care what I was wearing, I pulled on the top pair of jeans and a t-shirt as the phone was picked up.  "Nox?"

"Dorian, I know who it is."

Dorian's voice came over the phone but it still sounded surprised. "Know who what is?"

"The one who hurt you."  My voice was filled with venom even I knew that I didn't have.  That's when I noticed Jace was standing beside me waiting.

I stood up and tried to walk around him.  "Nox, someone else can handle this.  Just let me call your dad, he's been working the case while you've been in here."

"Jace, get out of my way."  

Dorian spoke quickly. "Jason do not let him leave.  I'll be right there to help."  And then the line went dead.  I couldn't imagine Dorian sprinting his way here no matter the cause but I had to be gone before he got here.  I knew he'd make me stay and he'd use every tool in his aresenal.  But he only needed to ask me and I would...  What did that mean?  

I pushed the curious thoughts away as I took another step to get around Jace but he moved to interept me.  "Jace, move or I will move you.  I don't want to hurt you."

"I know that.  But you can't go running off half cocked after whoever this person is because you aren't in your right mind.

"Jason.  Move!"  It was his last warning.

He stood his ground.   I watched him make ready for anything I could do to him.  He thought I would use magic, my ability.  He was faster and stronger than I was, but Jason Hill knew me better than any person ever.  He knew my first instinct, so I didn't go with it.  I rushed past him in a spurt of energy that I barely knew I had.  He looked at me with agony in his eyes as he toppled over out of surprise and worry.  I could see both emotions etched clearly on his face when I turned back to see him before walking out the door.

He could have caught me, but I threw up a wall of air in the doorway and he stood staring after me.  He didn't even bother trying to get out. 

I didn't take the stairs. Dorian knew I would avoide them, so the elevator it was.  I headed for the Dorimitory floors.  My anger fueled me, the fear slide around the anger not to bother my determination.  I would find Levi, and he would be put to justice.  I had every right to hunt him down and kill him.  Venatori law was Venatori law and I was a hunter, it was my job to put him down.  But even though he'd hurt Dorian I knew I coldn't just do that.  He was just a kid...

I walked through the elevator doors to the boy's dorms and found Mr. Larry sitting at his usual desk.  I could speak to him for hours about anyhing and everything when I was a child, but today he looked up at me and I only had one question.  "Where is Levi Hughes?"

"In his room."  Mr Larry said flatly.  "I'll go get him."

I shook my head.  "Just tell me where it is I'll get him myself."

"What's this all about Nox?"  he asked me standing up to block my way.

"He's marked."

The shock of what I had said registered.  "He's only a child.  Surely he didn't do anything that bad."

I just looked at him.  "Tell me where he is."

"Of course, Venatori."  He handed me a slip of paper with his room number on it with a note that said, "Don't kill him. please."

I looked at Mr. Larry.  "Apparently you know nothing of the man I became."  I didn't wait for his response as I headed for the door to the wing Levi's room was on.  I turned he corner and I saw Levi standing in his door talking with Garrett.  I froze in mid step.

Garrett left the other direction and Levi went into his room and neither of them noticed my frozen self standing in the hall.  I don't know how long I stood there willing myself to move.  The fury had been replaced with fear.  Why was Garrett talking with Levi?  Where they working together?

I started moving.  I had to figure this out.  Levi had to answer for his crimes but I would no be the one to kill him.  I was about to knock on the door when I heard the building go into lock down.  The lights went dim and the halls turned a sickly shade of red.  All the electronic doors released and would lock the moment they closed until someone in security shut them down.  I didn't have time to wonder what was going on before Levi opened his door and ran straight into me knocking me around.  

He stumbled and picked himself up and started running towards the stairs.  I didn't know why he was running he couldn't know why I was here unless he suspected...  Why had Garrett been here.

I ran after him.  The electroic doors to the stair well had recently been opened or theyd have been locked shut.  But I missed them, so I cut through the lock with a fine thread of fire.  I heard footstes racing up.  I followed.  I was weaker than I should be.

I could feel my knees straining with the effort of taking the stairs three at a time but I was gaining on him.  Levi was trying each door at every landing but nothing would budge.  He'd catch sight of me and start moving again.  He never even thought to use his gift.   How unfortunate or him.  

Three flightes before the roof Levi stopped checking doors and kept running.  What did he think he was going to do ... jump.

I had given him the key out.  I increased my pace.  He was full Venatori and faster than I was, and he was already out on the roof, the door was busted beyond repair, he'd finally decided his power was a worthy tool to use.  He stood by the edge of the room looking over.

I yelled over the howling wind that threatened to bring rain down upon us.  "Levi stop!"

He turned around and looked at me.  He was smiling and started walking back towards me.  "It had to be you.  You know you won't stop us.  The Venatori will fall."

Stupid villians always spouting their egotistical plans.  I let him continue speaking.  "I didn't kill the head of the snake, but someone else will.  But you won't catch me.  You are a poor excuse for a Venatori - half human.  They should have killed you when you were born."

Levi turned and ran towards the edge.  I followed.  He jumped and soared over the edge tucking himself into a ball to increase speed.  But he didn't spread any elements, he plummeted down faster than I'd ever dared.  I thought as quickly as I could and I sped down in his direction the same way, softening the ground as I did, I had wings of air ready for the moment I caught the stupid boy.  

When my body rammed into his I finished the pattern but there was only a few more seconds of falling before we rammed our selves into the ground - no matter how soft it was it was going to hurt like hell.  I thickened my wings and tried to slow us further but it wasn't enough.  I felt my body shatter on impact and then there was nothing but darkness...
