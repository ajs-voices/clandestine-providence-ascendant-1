## You Did What?

We had to wait for Margo's current appointment to finish so Dorian and I sat in her office waiting room.  It as always was filled with the soft comforting scent of apples.  I leaned against Dorian taking in both comforting scents and closed my eyes while we waited.  Dorian shifted and I sat forward and looked at him.  He seemed to be thinking about something.

"Penny for your thoughts?"  I asked him.

Dorian looked at me from the back of the couch and gave me a weak smile.  "Last night I had a visitor."

"What kind of visitor?"

Dorian frowned.  "My son."

My jaw dropped in surprise.  I didn't have a problem with Dorian having a past, but I hadn't know he'd slept with at least one woman.  

"It's not like what you are thinking."

"You didn't sleep with a woman and get her pregnant?"  I grinned, "Cause that's what I'm thinking.  I don't care if you have kids Dorian.  I'm just shocked to find out the completey gay man I'm with has slept with a woman."

"Is everything a joke to you?"  Dorian frowned.  "Sorry.  The whole thing is a big mess.  My parents were badgering me about my obligations.  I went to Denver, a place I didn't really know anyone and I experimented."

I grinned at him but I kept my mouth shut.  I didn't want Dorian to think I found it slightly amusing that way he was phrasing things.  He rolled his eyes, "Just say it."

"Well apparently your experiment was successful.  How long were you with her?"

"Three months.  I broke it off because it was getting serious, and I couldn't love her.  She was a sweet girl.  The day I broke it off she was going to tell me I was pregnant but I told her I liked men and she didn't tell me what she was going to.  Her mother called me later to yell at me about leaving her daughter with an unborn baby."

Dorian was distant and I saw a lingering fear in his eyes.  "She was human."

I frowned and was going to say something but Dorian continued.  "She had the baby.  They are both healthy, but that also means that he's Magnus.  It's the only possible solution to her problem.  100T of human female women who give birth to Minorem have been Magnus."

"I am aware of the improbability of his birth."

Dorian nodded.  "She lost her job a few weeks back.  I've arranged for her to come here for a job interview that she is guaranteed so her son can learn here."

"So what's your son like?" I asked.

Dorian shrugged.  "He's 4.  He likes Cars - as in the movie.  I think we watched it twice while he was at my house."

"Does he know who you are?"

"Stella wants to wait to tell him."  Dorian said flatly.

"Wait, is his name Aidan?"  I asked.

"Yeah.  How did you know that?"  Dorian asked confused.

"I met them on my flight in.  Stella gave me a ride here because Jace forgot about me.  I went up to her apartment."

Dorian's face grew angry and I held up my hands.  "I didn't sleep with her - honest.  She wanted to.  We talked on the plane, she found out a little of my history, figured I was a good pony to start her engines on again - after you apparently.  I can't say I was all that happy to find out some Venatori prick had left her."

"I didn't know."

I patted Dorian's knee. "I understand.  Really that my gut reaction.  I shouldn't have phrased it that way."

Dorian sighed.  "I was some prick.  I was screwing around with a human girl with full knowledge that things could happen.  Inexperience.  Not exactly something I typically have to deal with ya know."

I laughed, "Yeah hard to get a guy pregnant.  Though you'd be rich if you could."

Dorian rolled his eys.  "So you aren't angry?"

"That you have a son?"

"Any of it?"  Dorian asked.

"I see the dilemia.  I see both sides, but honestly Dorian I don't care about your past.  I can't be a dick about it and expect you not to g, but honestly Dorian I don't care about your past.  I can't be a dick about it and expect you not to be a dick about mine.  Mine is far worse than your's is."

"I could have killed her."

I nodded.  "Yeah but you didn't.  That's what I was upset about with her on the plane.  I couldn't imagine anyone doing that, but she didn't tell you so you couldn't warn her, or be there for her.  You are stepping up now though aren't you?"

Dorian nodded. "I'm gonna try."

"You'll be great."  I heard the door open and a man walk out of Margo's office and she waved me inside.  I took Dorian's hand and pulled him with me as I walked into her office.  Margo raised an eyebrow.  "I need to add to those papers."

Margo nodded.  "I'll have Megan print them out and we'll get them signed before we begin."

I sat down on the couch and Dorian sat down next to me as Margo stepped into the lobby to speak with Megan.  Dorian asked me, "Why am I in here?  And what papers?"

I smiled.  "Because I have no secrets to hide from you.  And the papers will allow you and Margo to discuss my sessions outside my presence.  I figure if you have questions, you might as well get the whole truth.  This is more than a conference."

Dorian was nodding as Margo set papers down in front of me and I sighed my name and wrote Dorian's name in the space provided.

Margo sat across from me, "Dorian do you understand the confidentiality of the agreement Nox is signing?"

"Not really.  First I've heard of it."

Margo nodded and leaned forward with her elbow on her knee that was crossed over the other leg.  "Usually these papers are reserved for individuals who are guardians or in the need to know - spouses, parents, and legal guardians.  Nox has one agreement in place for Dae'lin.  He's adding you to the list of people whom I can contact if I need to verify that he is doing well.  And you may contact me if you have any questions."

"Okay.  I only have one question."  He turned to look at me, "Why?"

"I told you why.  I'm not going to keep secrets from you.  Today, my past, my current situation on any given day."

"So why not just tell me?"  Dorian asked.

"Because I may not know what you want to know.  These sessions just aren't about my curent situation, they are my whole life.  Dealing with things as they come is part of it, but sometimes we talk about other things - like my mother or father.  About my need to push people away.  I want you to have an open line of communitcation with Margo if you think I'm hiding something from you or you feel I've not elaborated enough on.""

Dorian nodded.  "Okay.  But I want you to talk to me too.  That okay?"

I nodded in agreement.  "This isn't a substitute for that.  I promise."

Margo smiled, "Is this settled?"

We nodded.  Margo smiled.  "Good.  Now to the contents of your discharge."  Dorian handed her the envelope but she shook her head,"I have a copy".  

"Dr. Eriksen confession has been brought to the Infirmary board and she would have been put on displanry probation if it were not for her brother who explained her actions as proof of your immortality."

"My what?"

"Your healing ability prompted further testing of the pill they gave you.  It was a fast acting poison and even in your dimished state you healed."

"So she poisoned me to say I'm immortal.  It was specific to Venatori and kills humans instantly and Venatori with in a few hours.  So yes, you were taking it for two weeks three times a day."

"I'm still going to have her medical liscense revoked.  I'm not a guinea pig."

Dorian interrupted.  "You mean to say Nox's doctors have been poisoning him?"

Margo nodded.  "Under Venatori law the gentics research is legitmate, legal action can't be taken.  It's part of the Clandestine Providence to enhance our race to be the best it can be."

"So I"m fucked?"

Margo sighed.  "Your claim would be unfounded yes."

Dorian shook his head.  "So what are the terms of his discharge then?"

"Weekly meetings with Dr. Wilton until he clears Nox's mental stability and in that time he will also clear him for active field duty.  Monthly meetings with Dr. Eriksen which may include blood work, dna samples.  And change in your obligation to the breeding program.  As you are Minorem you were required two.  They are asking a minimum of two but would prefer it be as many as you can conceive naturally."

"And if the amount I can conceive is less than two?"  I grinned.

Margo shook her head, "that is something you should take up with your father.  He can go over those particular details better.  He can probably help you arrange them as well."

"I'm not in need of finding any women to sleep with.  The problem becomes my current relationship.  Not exactly going to produce children here."

Margo nodded.  "I understand that.  You two will need to work on your obligations.  The rules are the rules, Nox and you know this."

"You know I've never liked rules."  I sighed, "Anything else?"

She shook her head.  "No.  But the roof is off limits."

I sighed.  "Fine.  Can I go now?"

Margo nodded and offered Dorian her hand.  "Dorian, I look forward to helping you understand this crazy one."  She patted my knee with her other hand and I stuck my tongue out at her.

"I will see you boy's later.  Oh Nox, your father left me something to give you."  She picked up a set of keys on her desk.  "Your new place.  Status increase thanks to your paper, a few medics reports and your new found immortality."  

I took the keys from Margo and sighed.  "I guess nearly dying had some positive effects."

Dorian opened the door and put his hand on my waist as I passed in front of him.  I smiled at Megan.  "Same time Monday?" I asked.

She nodded. "Yep.  9:30am still on the books Nox."

"See ya next Monday then."

We left the Infirmary levels and headed for my new digs.
