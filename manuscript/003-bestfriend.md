## Best Friend

The landing made me sweat and my heart race as it always had, but Stella's warm hand on mine helped keep the worst of the panic attack away.  Thoughts of my mother were never good.  We waited until the plane was nearly empty before we got stood up and started gathering our things.  Aidan had passed out.  "I'll help you get to your car."

Stella smiled and nodded her thanks.  "Alright.  I appreciate it."

"No problem."  I said as we walked down the narrow passage of the airplane to the exit.  The catwalk made me just as nervous.  The long arm of steel and flooring suspended off the ground wasn't much better than an elevator if you asked me.  I took a deep breathe once we reached the terminal and I stopped at the first row of chairs and sat down for a moment to catch my breath and slow my heart rate.

Stella stood swaying next to me as she rocked Aidan's still sleeping form.  She asked, "You okay?"

I nodded and stood up.  "Yeah.  Better now.  Thanks."  I smiled at her and grabbed the stroller and unfolded it so Stella could drop the little one into it.  

He squawked a moment before he was passed out again with his little stuffed animal.  I couldn't quite make it out as Stella placed it in his arms.  It was yet another reminder of my first flight - holding on to my little stuffed Mushu and crying into his red plush fur trying not to upset my mother more.

I shook my hands and my body and we moved forward.  Stella didn't ask and I was grateful for not having to fully dredge up that memory.

We walked slowly through the cooridor of terminals in JFK's airport.  I had landed her often, but I remembered walking down the same path my first time.  Garrett houlding my hand and talking to me about what we were about to embark upon.  

I fought back the bile that started to rise in my stomach at the thought of my tormentor.  I hated him more than I hated my mother.  And for good reason.  But I shook the memories off as we reached the baggage claim area.  I expected to see Jace standing there with some stupid sign like he always did but he wasn't anywhere to be seen.  I pulled my phone out of my pocket and checked the time.  We were late - which means Jace got busy or forgot.  I would lay my bet on forgot.  It wouldn't be the first time.

Items had already started rolling around the carosel and Stella was pulling at her bags as they passed.  I stepped up beside her and helped her get the heavy bag off the belt and on to the floor next to Stella.  "What do you have in there?" I asked.  It wasn't overly heavy for me, but it was bulky and not really what I'd have brought with a child in tow, but it was the only bag other than her carryons so it was full utility it seemed.

Stella shook her head, "You've never traveled with a kid before."

I grinned.  "Can't say that I have."  My things made their way around.  One backpack filled with camping gear, the pots and pan I used out in the field were tie wrapped to their holsters for safe keeping, and my duffle full of my entire wardrobe and my life at current.  If it didn't fit in either, or my carryon backpack I didn't need it.  Was as simple as that.  My gun and survival knife were stored in a lock box in the camping bag and I had permits that said I could carry then on the plane in proper storage.  I hadn't gotten any complaints when I declared them.  I was a liscensed private invesigator among other things in order to get when I needed done - as were all hunters.  The human world was always getting in the way of things.

Stella giggled.  "Regular old grizzly adams."  She reached up and the beard on my chin.  "Though your beard could use some work."

I rolled my eyes.  "I like it like this."

Stella blushed, "So do I."  She started walking towards the car rental stands and I followed behind her pushing Aidan while she carried the suit case.  He had grabbed it on purpose.  

I stood back and waited for Stella to finish up with her rental and I looked around for any sign that my best friend would show up.  I didn't see him.  I pulled out my phone and dialed his number.  The phone rang for half a ring before I heard, "Fuck! I'm sorry."

I laughed.  "You forgot - again?"

"Yeah man.  Sorry.  I'll be there in an hour can you hold tight."  Jace sounded rushed and I knew he'd not be here in an hour.

"Nah.  I'll just take a cab."  

Stella stood next to me. "No you won't.  I'll drop you off anywhere you want.  It's the least I can do."

I smiled at her then I heard Jace, "Did you pick up a girl?"

I laughed.  "Not so much as picked up as she helped me through the flight."

I heard Jace groan on the other side.  "Dude, you better pay her back real well."

I smiled.  "I think we are even man.  I'll call you later, let you know the plan."

"Alright dude, but Mia expects you at the house tonight."

I nodded.  "I know.  I'm looking forward to it.  Can't wait to see Naya and JJ.  And Mia.  You I'm mad at."

Jace barked a laugh.  "Fair enough.  I'm sorry man. Really.  We'll be leaving her around 5pm so call before then."

"Alright, Jace.  Love ya babe."

"Love ya too.  See ya soon."  Jace hung up the phone and Stella was looking away.

"Babe? Your boyfriend?" She asked.  She looked a little down

I shook my head.  "My best friend.  Just a term of endearmant we toss around.  Use to be to make people uncomfortable, now it's just habit."

"And you love him?" Stella seemed a little taken back by my exchange of words.

"He's like a brother to me.  Yeah. I love him."  

"Oh."  Stella stammered without really wanting to say what she wanted, I could hear it in her voice.

"Now you are questioning things?  About me?  And Jace?"  I leaned down and whispered in Stella's ear.  "I like men, yes. But I also like women."

"Oh."  Her voice rose up in a cresendo and I knew I had taken her off guard by telling her what she had been wondering.

I grabbed the baggage handle before Stella could and hoisted my dubble on my shoulder and said, "Lead the way."

Stella sighed. "Alright."  I followed the short little red head to the SUV they had rented for her.  It was a safe enough model.

She packed her things in first then I set mine in behind her minus the bag I'd brought on the plane with me.  Stella handed me Aidan as she finished putting the stroller in then moved to the passenger side rear seat and started strapping in the car seat.  I watched as she worked.  She'd done this many times from the look of it.  It made me wonder what kinda guy doesn't step up to a girl like this.  I urked me a bit.

Aidan was groggy in my arms and laying his head against the crock of my neck and humming to himself as I rubbed his back when Stella turned around with a smile.  "I've never seen him take to anyone like you."

I grinned.  "I told you it's the relative age distance."

She strapped Aidan in and I climb into the passenger side.  I had no problems letting a woman drive.  As long as I wasn't driving in New York City I was happy.
