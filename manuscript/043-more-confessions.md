## More Confessions

I think the absence of my presence called down my father.  I could hear him sqwacking about who I knew vampires and how things had to be different in my head.  It wasn't until Dorian stepped into the kitchen bearing his empty wine glass in hand that I realized it was a bit stressful for Dorian too.

Mrs. Vega had me chopping vegetables into thin slices.  She refused to tell me what she was making.  Dorian sat down at the bar and watched as I sliced carefully through the squash.  He was sipping at another glass of wine, actually I think it was my glass.  I grinned across the bar at him.  

"So Mother, what are we having for dinner?"

She turned and gave him a look that said none of his business before she started back to her prep work.

"She isn't saying.  I think she's afraid our fathers will overhear and run away."

Dorian glanced back at our fathers who were in a hushed conversation.  "You may be right."

Dorian poured another glass of wine and his mother laughed, "Dorian, enough."

"He's had a stressful day, he's good.  I'll make sure he gets home safely."  I grinned at him and Mrs. Vega sighed.

"How stressful can his day off be?"

I smiled.  "He's with me.  I can be rather stressful."

"I find that hard to beleive.  Such a quiet young man."

Dorian snorted.  "You really don't know Nox very well."  Dorian tapped his fingers against the wine glass, the tips of his fingernails pinging the crystal at a very annoying frequency before he sipped again and then continued.  "The hair and makeup are the smallest aspects of his atmosphere."

Mrs. Vega laughed, "Darling.  It is why you are so attracted to your complete opposite.  He flaunts who he is - you do not.  He is proud of the man he is.  Dorian we both know that you are always trying to prove yourself to us because you feel we do not approve of your choices.  Which has never been the case.  We are proud of you and love you for the man that you are.  Nox is only showing you it's okay to be what you are."

"And what am I mother?"  He sounded angry at her for bringing up his insecurities.

I answered for her.  "The love of my life, Dorian."

His eyes went big and he stared at me as I smiled down at the vegetables I was cutting.  When I looked up he was still staring at me.  "What?"  I asked.  I knew the question and he didn't have to answer.  "I know, too much, too soon.  But it's the truth Dorian.  You don't have to feel the same way.  And I won't be upset if it ends before it begins, but there is no one in this world who feels like home more than you do."

Mrs Vega had silenetly left the kitchen as I was speaking and Dorian was still staring wide eyed at me.  "I dreamt about you in my coma.  I know when you are around.  You comfort me just by being in the same room.  I couldn't imagine a life where I can sleep through the night until I met you.  I'm not telling you this to scare you away or to expect things to change.  But I'm willing to do what you need me to do to protect your image, to be the man behind the curtain who isn't your lover by day.  I can do anything for you you just have to tell me."

Dorian smiled at me and came around the counter and turned me to face him.  He leaned in and kissed me softly before he whispered in my ear, "You are perfect just the way you are.  And I'm not going anywhere."

I pulled Dorian close to me and wrapped my arms around his waist but he pushed me away playfully.  "I'm going to go find something else to do."

I pouted and Dorian laughed as he left, his mother coming in through the door he was leaving.  She was smiling at me.  "Thank you for that."

I smiled at her.  "It's the truth, but you are welcome."

She walked over and stood by me scopping up the cut vegetables and placing them into a bowl.  "He's always tried to hide his feelings.  If it weren't for Todd we'd probably still wondering why we had no more grandkids."

I laughed, "Well I will change that I hope."

I watched her raise her eyebrow.  "That serious?"

"Well it's the reason I came home.  To start a family."

"Does Dorian know?"

I shrugged.  "We've not discussed it completely but I think he knows.  It's not like we don't have obligations to fullfil."

Mrs. Vega placed a casserole dish into the oven and then looked over at me as I stood against the bar in the middle of the kitchen.  "And this doesn't bother you?"

"Does what bother me?  Having sex with a woman?  I like women.  I like men.  If you mean if it bothers me that Dorian would be with someone else, then yeah a little, but there are ways to enjoy that as well.  And I honestly think Dorian would have a better time if I were with him too."

The older woman blushed at my very open talk about sex with my boyfriends mother.  I grinned at her.  "I don't intend to hurt your son in the process, but that obligation isn't going to go away because I'm with Dorian."

"I guess you are right."  She smiled.  "It's not quite so easy for Dorian.  Though he does have a son."

I grinned back at her, "And he's great.  You need anymore assistance?"

She laughed.  "No Dorian went to his room, first door on the right down the hall."

"Thanks."  I gave her a small flourishing bow.

My father was talking with Emilio and I overheard a little about their vampire business.  I stopped in front of the partially open door and knocked softly as I pulled out my phone from my back pocket.  Dorian called out.  "Come in."

I pushed the door open and he was staring at the far wall staring at the posters of his childhood.  He smiled.  "My mother dismiss you?"

I smiled.  "Something like that."  

I found Ant's number in my phone and texted him that my father would be open to a neutral meeting place.  I then slipped it back into my back pocket and saw Dorian watching me.  I glanced around Dorian's room with a grin.  "Not exactly what I expected.  I expected more greys and blacks and stark white walls, not glam band posters, and sycadellic artwork."  Dorian chuckled as I picked up the  nail polish sitting on his desk which apparently doubled as a vanity because there was other various makeup neatly placed as if had never used them and it was for show.  But I knew Dorian had worn makeup as a teenager.   Nothing blatent but enough I had noticed.

I picked up a saphire blue bottle of nail polish and shook it and grinned, it hadn't gone sticky with time yet.  Which made me wonder if Dorian or his mother replaced them. I could feel Dorian watch me as I opened the bottle and the familiar scent of nail polish wafted up.  I applied it to my left thumb in three deft strokes.

Dorian sat down on his bed still watching me apply the nail polish to my left hand.  He was chuckling softly to himself. "You've done that before."

I turned the chair to face him and smiled.  "Of course.  It looks horrible after a few days so I don't bother."

Dorian stood up and handed me a clear bottle.  "That's why I still use this."

I grinned.  "I know."

I blew on the polish on my left hand as Dorian grabbed the bottle and my right hand.  "It matches the color in your hair."

I smiled.  "I know."

"You gonna keep saying that."

I laughed.  "I know.  But that doesn't make any sense what so ever."

Dorian painted each nail delicately.  I watched him holding my hand in his and his steady hand.  "You are good at this."

Dorian looked up at me with a grin.  "I'm out of practice."

"It's like riding a bike."

"Oh?"  Dorian asked.

I just smiled back at Dorian.  We talked about the past and things we liked then and how much we had in common back then and we'd never really known.  And then Dorian added, "I never thought I'd find a guy I liked enough to bring home or to my room.  Hell, it was never even a possiblity.  I had every intention when I was younger to find a girl I liked just enough and marry her and have kids - the perfect family."

"You still can if that's what you want."  I said with a smile.

He shook his head.  "No.  If there is one thing I've learned these past few months is t hat I wouldn't be happy then.  Not like I am happy with you."  He shook his head again lost in thought.  "I just don't know how this is going to work."

I asked, "What?"

"You and me, our obligations."

I smiled.  "We can share our bed Dorian.  At least long enough to meet our obligations.  I have more than enough suitors, I'm sure we could reach an agreement for you as well."

Dorian was the same color his mother had turned at the same general comment I'd made to her.  He shook his head.  I got up from the chair I'd been sitting in and pushed Dorian's chest and he laid back, his head propped up on the wall behind him, his hands behind his head, as I sat on his hips and placed my hands under his arm pits and leaned down close enough to kiss him and spoke "We can make this work in all ways Dorian."

Dorian leaned up and caught my bottom lip between his teeth and bit softly and a small moan left my mouth as he kissed me.  Our mouths were the only things we were touching, our tongues dancing inside exploring and eliciting small sounds from one another.
