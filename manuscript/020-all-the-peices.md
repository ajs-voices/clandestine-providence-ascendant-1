## All The Peices

I didn't wake from a normal dream.  I was breathing hard and my heart was racing but in a good way and I well... you don't need to hear that.  I opened my eyes and found that I was a lone in the room.  I didn't know how long I had slept or what they'd given me to do so.  I sat up and found the IV still in my arm that had caused me to pass out so easily.  I pulled the needle from my arm in a less than ceremonious way. The liquid oozed out and I had to put pressure on the hole in my arm before it quickly closes off.  At least that was a good thing, I was kinda healing.  

Alarms went off in my room and nurses came running but they slowed down once they saw me disconnecting the wires from my body.  "I'm leaving now."

I put my foot down on the floor and stood up but my knees gave way underneath me but a quick nurse caught me and helped me back to sit on the bed.  "No you aren't."

Dorian chose that moment to walk in, he was standing a fresh suit, his hair was neatly done and I could smell the freshly applied after shave that covered up the cinamon and vanilla.  I smiled at him but he stood in the door waiting on the nurses to leave.  Which they didn't until I was lying back down in the bed.  When he walked in he had a bag of food I couldn't make out the different smells as he pulled the bed side table over the bed and started laying out a table setting worthy of the finest restauarant.  "I figured you'd want real food."

I raised an eye brow at him, I wasn't sure if what he called real food and what I did quallified as the same thing.  The food was still hot, he'd just gone to get it.  He started opening containers as he sat down on the edge of the bed facing me on the otherside of the flimsy table.  "They say you need to stay here another couple of days, but if you eat, you can keep that out of your arm.  But you need to keep fueling the repair of your energy."

I grinned at him.  "I can share yours."

He looked up down at me to see if I was joking which I wasn't.  "How so?"

"It's only a theory.  But you can fuel my body as I did your's to heal."

Dorian shook his head, "I'm not Cesari."

"You shouldn't have to be.  As long as you can think and weave the patterns fast enough.  You'll look like Cesari to outsiders but it would be individual threads at one time.  But like I said it's just a theory."

Dorian asked, "And what would this theory entail to test?"

"A willing participant, a person who can touch all four elements preferrably someone who can remember the sequence quickly and who has the reflexes to preform them quickly.  I mean it's a simple weave, but it needs to be maintained for severl minutes in order for there to be enough to help my body heal itself faster."

I laughed.  "You'd think I was the one that was blown up."

Dorian didn't laugh.  I frowned.  "I'm sorry.  How is your mother?"

Dorian patted my hand.  "She is doing excellent thanks to you.  There were no major burns left to heal only first degree for both of us and no internal injuries.  Thank you."

I smiled up at him and my stomach growled.  Dorian finished plating the food.  "After you eat you can show me.  I will try.  It won't hurt you if it goes badly will it?"

"The weaves are harmless to my knowledge so we should be good."

Dorian pulled a few more things out of the corner while I dug into the food he'd placed carefully in front of me.  Chicken catetori piled high with vegetables in a lemon garlic sauce.  "Victor's?" I asked as I stuffed another peice of food in my mouth.

"Yes."  Dorian said as he dropped a bag on my bed.  "He said it has healing powers."

I grinned at him and nodded.  "It does."  I moaned softly through bites. "My god it's good."

Dorian laughed.  "I will be sure to tell Victor."

He pulled out my laptop, my paper work and a few other file folders I hadn't seen before. On one of those tabs I saw Levi Hughes written on it.  I looked up at Dorian, "Did we find Levi?"

Dorian nodded.  "Yes.  He had gone to his room. He's been placed in Dae'lin's watchful care until you are better.  If she could handle you, she can handle him."

"What are the other files?"

Dorian placed a red one on my laptop, "This is the forensics for the first scene.  The blue one is the one two days ago."

"Wait - two days?  I've been sleeping for two days?"

Dorian nodded.  "Yeah.  Did no one tell you?"

I sighed.  "Have there been any other bombings?"

Dorian shook his head.   "No."  But he didn't sound convinced they had blown over.  Dorian continued, "The green folder is the photo footage we took but you already have on your laptop.  The yellow is the second scene.  We had no one as skilled as you or I to do the reconstruction so I don't expect we'll get the same results but I figured it was something you could do lying in bed."

He stood up and straighted his cuffs and leaned over and kissed me softly.  He tasted like toothpaste still and the pepermint didn't quite go so well with my food. But I didn't care I enjoyed the feel of him against me.  I grabbed his tie and pulled him closer and he obliged me a little before he pulled away breathless and straightening the golden tie against his stark white shirt.  "I have to go to work.  I'll be back later with more food.  I think Bonnie wants to send a whole pie your way."

I smiled.  "Alright."  I started to reach for his tie but thought better of it and simply asked, "Another kiss before you leave?  Please?"  I sounded pathetic even to my own ear, but Dorian only chuckled.

He leaned in and kissed me tenderly on the cheek and when I turned to meet his lips he pulled away.  I shook my head, "Fine be that way."

Dorian pressed his lips against mine hard and bit my bottom lip before he pulled away.  "Now I have to go to work."

I grinned at him.  "Thank you. Sorry I rumbled your tie."

He smiled and straightened it again.  "No harm, no foul.  I will see you later Nox."  Dorian turned around and walked out of my hospital room door and a gaggle of nurses at the station outside my room watched him walk off down the hall.  

I grinned and yelled at them, "He's mine!"

They all turned and looked at me and then scattered in small groups heading back tot heir own routes.  Dorian was garnering a lot of attention today. I wondered if he was getting as many proposition as I was - probably more, I thought to myself idly as I finished what was left of the food he'd brought me.  I hadn't realized most of it was gone.  Had I finished it that quickly.  My stomach rumbled and I hit the call button.

A small blonde waltz into my room with a questioning look on her face, "Yes?"

"When is breakfast served around here?"  I asked.

"You **just** ate." She sounded surprised.

"Yeah.  I am feeding a supernatural energy that kinda made me pass out because I overused it.  It's like feeding an army."

She asked, "Has it happened before?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I've never drained myself before.  I've never had cause to delepte my resources before."

"You shouldn't do that."

"Well duh!  I see that now.  How was I supposed to know that splitting my reserves would do that?"

She rolled her eyes at me.  "If I see you using your ability at all while you are in here I will gut you myself - pretty face or not?"

"Pretty face?  I do hope you are talking about Dorian and not me."

She winked at me.  "Not that he'd ever notice anyway with you around."

I grinned, "He'd not notice you like that anyway, Duckling.  He's all men all the time.  Unlike my grand self."

"I heard you were a cocky one."  She left the room and headed down the hall the way Dorian had gone and my stomach rumbled again.  I hoped she was successful in finding food.  As I started looking at the last scene that was sitting on top of my laptop just waiting for me to put the puzzle together.

Dorian had already put the images in that manipulation program we use earlier - two days earlier.  I was going to take a few days to adjust to the missed days.  I started going through the images and placing the peices again.  It wasn't as hard as the first time but the patterns weren't drawn very well.  But I worked the best I could with what I had.

The nurse who was in my room before set a tray of food down on my table and walked away.  I yelled after her.  "And if this isn't enough?"

She turned with a bright smile.  "We'll bring you more.  Drink plenty of water as well."

I nodded, "Always do."

There were three bottles of water on the tray and a lot of fried food. I sighed.  I pressed the call button again.  She showed back up and I smiled pushing the tray away.  "This will make me sick."  I asked, "Can I have my phone?  I'll just order something."

She shook her phone.  "No, I can't let you order food to be delivered.  Your family can bring you food, but ..."  

And as if I had summoned him Jace showed up at my door bearing bags of food.  The pretty blonde nurse turned and smiled, "It seems your family knows you well."

Jace laughed, "You brought him fried chicken and french fries."  Jace picked up a french frie and popped it in his mouth, "Still hot too.  Darling, don't feed him junk.  Protein and vegetables - a little grains and unless it's pasta or fancy smancy bread he won't eat it." Jace grinned, "Just a tidbit."

He stepped inside and placed two paper bags on my table and moved the trahe other one in the room and started eating from it.  "Unless of course you are bringing food to everyone else who might be visiting him.  Then most of us will eat whatever it is."  He rolled his eyes.  "The man is too picky for his own good.  Doesn't know what's good and what's not."  Jace bit into the fried chicken leg and juices ran down his chin.

I rolled my eyes.  "Thanks Jace."  Whatever was in the bag smelled wonderful.  "Mia make it?"

"No I did.  Of course she did.  She figured you were awake now, and that needle in your arm wasn't going to stay in long so she's been cooking for four of you since she found out you had woken up."

I didn't hesitate to open up the bag and find all the glorious smells pushing past my nose.  Mia could cook.  Not as good as me, but she was damn fine.  I didn't care what I pulled out first I ate whatever it was and it was delicious.  The nurse looked at me like I was some alien or something shaking her head as she left muttering something about manners.  So what, I was eating with my fingers.

Jace looked at the laptop screen and frowned.  "You aren't your puzzles."

I only smiled at him and continued eating.  "So.  Dorian?"  There was that certain lit to his voice that implied he wanted details.  

I finished chewing the asapargus I was downing.  "I don't kiss and tell, you know that."

He stuck his tongue out at me.  "Awe, come on.  He's a good lay, the least you could do is share some of the details."

"I haven't slept with him yet, Jace.  There's been like one day where I was seeing him."

Jace stared at me unblinking, "Seriously?  Why the fuck not.  You've been pining over him since the Academy."

"I have not been pining.  We came close.  But I carded him."

"Jeez Nox, what he do?"

"Nothing wrong.  Nothing he wouldn't know not to do."

Jace frowned, "You broke your own rules, how unlike you."

I sighed.  "I wasn't intending to go anywhere with him at the time, it just happened.  His hand, his mouth..."  I could replay everything in my head but my stomach growled and I started the next bowl.

"Damn it boy.  Mia's gonna be cooking for a month if you are eating like this."

"If they let me out of here I can feed myself."

Jace sighed.  "From what I hear they ain't letting you out soon."

I continued eating the homemade mushu pork with my fingers and stared at the laptop screen.  Something clicked and I set the food down and licked my fingers clean.  My fingers were still sticky but the keyboard would just have to be cleaned later.  I moved the peices of the bad drawing around and saw it formed the same general shape as the last one.  It nagged at me, but this one was different it was inverted.

Jace had moved to sit next to me and was watching me manipulate things.  I swapped out the new one for the old one and tried to invert the drawings I had made.  Jace whistled.  "You've only gotten better.  I haven't seen your stuff for a while."

I just nodded as I tried to make the program do what I wanted.  I sighed in fustration, I wanted to push the table away from me in anger but that would do little go so I flung a small fireball at the wall.  No sensors went off and there was only a small spattering of char on the wall.

Jace asked, "What's wrong?  Can I help?"

"I need to invert the peice, it's drawn backwards.  Does that make sense.  I don't know this program well enough."

Jace grinned.  "You never were terribly handy when it came to figure the easy stuff out.  Give you a fucking puzzle with a billion peices and you'd have it done in an hour.  Finding your socks that were under your bed, that took days."

I stuck my tongue out at Jace and picked up my food again.  Jace reached into the bag and handed me a fork.  "There are things called forks.  You eat with them.  Grow up man.  You are fucking a man who likes everything in order."

I sighed.  "I've not fucked him yet Jace."  I heard the anger in my voice and Jace turned to look at me.

"Dude, chill.  I get it.  Just friends."

I sighed, "Sorry.  It's not just friends either."

"What you falling in love with him?"  I could hear the joke in his voice but when I didn't answer him with a revernt denial he turned to look at me, "You're joking, right?"

I shrugged.  "I came back to do just that didn't I?"

"Yeah but with Dorian Vega.  Man you can't start a family with another guy. At least not easily.  He's good in bed Nox.  But he ain't that good.  Not that special to give up your dreams for."

"Who said I had to give up my dreams?  Do you know how many women are throwing themsleves at me?  I already have sex planned with one.  And she doesn't want the kid."

Jace looked at me with astonishment in his eyes.  "You are one lucky S.O.B."

I shrugged and Jace turned the laptop back around to face me.  "That it?"

I nodded, "Fuck me!"

Jace laughed, "Don't mind if I do."

I shook my head.  "I gotta go find someone."
