## Proposition

I dropped my gear off in my crap room.  It was a simple studio apartment layout with a small kitchenette, with two person table, a tv on the wall and a queen sized bed.  Everything in the room was beige - the most boring color in the world.  I had called Jace and he said he'd meet me here.  He wanted to know what happened, but I didn't want to talk about it. 

There was a knock on the door and I quickly answered it with my duffle bag and carry on from the plane in my hand.  It wasn't Jace.  It was a pretty little brunette with little red gem in the center of her head - one of our Indian natives it appeared.  Like humans the Venatori tended to pick up nationalities and heritages akin to the humans.  There was only one Indian family that I knew of which meant that this little fox was a Dowager.

"How can I help you Ms. Dowager?"  I asked.

"Oh, you know who I am?" she asked.

I shook my head.  "No, ma'am, just a guess."

"Oh.  Well I was told you were coming to town.  I have a proposal for you.  If we can talk in private."  

She was very confident I would say yes so I stood in the door way and said, "I've been back a few hours and already getting hit up with offers of breeding?"

She blushed.  "I'm sorry, but I wanted to be the first."

I sighed then stepped aside.  Come on in."

I dropped my bags at the door as she sat down at the table delicately.  I searched in my cupboards for glasses and found two and poured two glasses of ice water from the fridge and set one down in front of Ms. Dowager.  "I'd offer you something else but I just got in."

"Where you going somewhere?"  she asked nodding to my things.

"To my best friends place for a home cooked meal and some family time."  There was no reason to lie to her.

"I won't keep you long." she said.

I sat down across from her and leaned back against the back and waited for her to continue but she sat and watched me sipping at her water. "Your proposal?"

She nodded.  "I was just examining your features."

"Like cattle.  Thanks."  The sarcasm dripped like honey from my mouth.  I hated being treated like I was nothing more than breeding stock.

"Apologies.  I didn't mean to offend you."  She seemed sincere.  "I'm here to offer you my daughter."

"And what does she think on the matter?"  I asked. I wasn't exactly thrilled with pre-arranged marriages much less pre-arranged sexual partners.

"She asked me to speak to you on her behalf.  She just graduated from the Academy.  Your name has been floating about Academia and the Scrin.  And we beleive your line would be a great addition to our own."

"You do realize I am half human?"

She nodded.  "We are aware.  We have taken that into consideration.  The pure bloodline isn't a determinantal factor in this case.  You are Cesari.  The probability of Magnus is far greater than the small loss of potential ability.  You do not have Venatori speed, strength or agility if I'm to understand correctly.  But you possess our keen senses and from Ms. Rivera's report our senses are sometimes keener than our own.  You have an exceptional healing ability as we do despite being half human.  The lost abilities aren't a concern for a Scrin."    She was highly informed about me.

"And what do I get out of this?"  These things usually benefited all parties.

"Well.  An improved status.  A child to raise without interference with one exception."

"You mean your daughter doesn't want to raise her own child?"  I was shocked.

"You are correct.  Anabel doesn't wish to be a mother, but she wishes to remove her obligation to the Venatori as quickly as possible."  She sighed.  "We only want the child to be Scrin."

"I won't force my children one way or the other.  I can guide them in a particular direction but it is their choice not mine."

She sighed.  "The first child would be ours.   The second your line.  Both raised by you, two years apart."

"I see you have this all figured out.  What makes you think I want to raise children?"  I wanted to know why they thought this was compensation for my genes.

She smiled at me.  "I am aware of your issues with children raised by the community.  I don't expect you would let your children be raised by us as anymore than your father would."

"You know my father?"

"Of course.  Kai Viddens is a good friend."

"The two of you put this together then?"  I knew my father would interfer with my life.

She shook her head.  "No.  We did discuss you but I only did so because it was what my grandmother wanted.  Tradition between families."

"How long do I have to think about this?"

Ms. Dowager stood up and pulled a card from her small glittery handbag.  "You can call me anytime with your answer.  It is a good proposition, Master SÃ©tanta."

I nodded and took the card.  "It is but I want to do my due dillenge as you have apparently done yours."

"Fair enough."  She headed for the door and smiled.  "A true Scrin.  You would definitely find a home among us if you so choose to chase the knowledge."

I laughed.   "I don't think I would be a very good scholar."  I walked her to the door and kissed her hand good-bye.  "It was a pleasure, Ms. Dowager.  I will be in touch."

Down the hall I heard a throat clear and I turned to see Mia Hill standing there in her pixie cut brown hair and a pair of holey jeans.  I laughed.  "Can't you find pants without holes?  I'll have to speak with Jace about upping your allowance."

Mia hugged me then stepped inside my room grabbed my bag and I picked up my duffle and shut my door behind me.  "I missed you Nox."

"I missed you too Mia.  Can't wait to have you cook for me."

Mia grinned back at me.  "Ditto.  I got dinner, you get breakfast."

I nodded.  "Sounds like a deal".
