## Epilogue

I grabbed a shower the moment I got home to the pack house.  The house was packed when I stepped into the gathering areas of the house.  Elena was the first to spot me and waved me over.  I wrapped my arms around her and gave her a hug and whispered in her ear, "I'm sorry about Charles."

She gave me a weak smile.  "He was a proud man, he died well."

"I just wish he hadn't needed to die."  

She kissed my cheek and smiled, "It was foretold Nox - from the ashes he will rise."

"I'm not prophecy fullfillment.  I'm just me.  His death was needless.  It served no purpose.  He was not pack leader, nor leader of anything."

Elena smiled, "And Garrett's death, was it needless?  He did the same as Charles stood up for what he beleived in."

I frowned.  "It was needless.  I hate to say it, but it did nothing more than satisfy my revenge.  It changes nothing.  My childhood still scars me internally if not externally and my dreams will still haunt me even if I no longer fear being hurt from them."  I sighed, "Only one death truly was needed to save the people I love.  James died honorably."

"But with the Imperataors death you can affect real change.  While it was a needless death, it has the greatest avenue for change."  Elena smiled.  "You have so much to do now.  I don't even know where to begin to help you."

"Right now, we all relax and have a good time.  We have a lot to celebrate.  Tomorrow we can start rebuilding."

I felt an arm snake across my waist and Isabel curled under my arm and leaned against my chest.  "You have a few people who would like to meet you Nox."

I kissed Elena on the cheek. "Duckling, I will speak with you tomorrow then.  Enjoy your evening.  If you need comforting, you are welcome to spend the night with us."

Elena nodded and patted my hand as Isabel lead me off.  Isabel grinned.  "I think your bed will be rather full tonight.  Celebration and grief."

I nodded.  "It's good thing we have a big bed then.  Where are we going?

"In here." Isabel opened the office door where Dorian and Anabel stood watching and two clean little boys hold a baby girl.  Dorian looked up and smiled at me.  

He knelt down and asked, "Can I borrow Dakota for a minute she needs to meet someone very special to us."

The boys nodded and Dorian lifted the child from their hands and carried her towards me carefully.  He placed her in my arms and introduced us.  "Nox I'd like you to meet our daughter, Dakota.  And I mean our in so many different ways."

I smiled down at the little girl with the darkest eyes I'd ever seen.  "She's beautiful."

I rocked her and cooed at her for a few minutes lost in the moment that this could have been my life.  I handed her back to Dorian.  "Take care of her."

"We will.  I think the four of us need to talk."  Dorian said.

I nodded.  "First things first."  I walked over to the boys sitting in my office chair and were now spinning around in circle.  I have them a quick push and then caught them as they whirled past me a second time.  "I'm Nox.  Can I ask you your names now?"

"Chance," said the bigger boy, "This is my brother Victor."

"Chance and Victor.  This is Isabel, and Anabel.  And that's Dorian."  I pointed to them in turn.  "We are all going to make sure you are taken care of okay?"

They nodded. "Good.  I want you to make yourself at home here, this is your house now too.  So I want you to go out there and I want you to find Ms. Elena and Ms. Emily and I want you to help them make our guests comfortable.  We have a lot of them.  Celia can help you too."

They got up from the chair tipping over from the spinning and then gigled. Victor hugged me tightly.  "You are so colorful."

I frowned.  "I'm sorry."

He laughed, "It's so pretty."

"Thank you."

I stood up and watched the boys leave.  I looked up and saw Dorian looking at me with questions.  I smiled at him.  "He sees Auras."

Dorian nodded.  "We'll have to help him understand, we've seen too many humans go crazy with that."

Isabel wrapped an arm around me and around Dorian.  "Their family was killed by werewolves."

I looked at Anabel and saw the expression on her face and smiled softly at her.  I held out my hand to her.  "You are Dorian's wife?"  She nodded.  "Isabel is mine."

Dorian looked at me with shock and then a frown.  "I..."

Isabel laughed, "He didn't move on Dorian.  His love for you is the reason we are married.  He couldn't save you and not protect his pack if he failed."

"Marriages of necessity."  Anabel said.

I shook my head.  "No, Anabel.  Marriages born of necessity out of love.  This doesn't have to be messy. I love Dorian.  I love Izzy.  I am not beyond the idea that we can't figure out someway to make this foursome work."

Anabel sighed, "My marriage is loveless, Nox.  Why would I want it to work?"

"Because of your children."

"They aren't Dorian's, you know this."

I smiled. "But all the paperwork say they are.  They are created to maintain the idea that Dorian kept his obligations.  You would leave your children because Dorian doesn't love you the way you want him to?  What if we loved you?"

"We?"

"All of us.  Sex is only part of a relationship Anabel.  Dorian is capable of loving you, and I'm sure he does.  He loves Stella.  Just not in the way either of you want.  Family is not made up of blood, or magic but bonds we choose to forge that tie us together stronger than that.  Not because someone tells us we have to, but because we want to."

I looked at each of them. "Help me recreate the Providence that should exist not the one that does exist."  

Isabel nodded.  "You know I'm in."

Dorian nodded his ascent.  We all looked to Anabel.

"Why do you want me?  I bring nothing to the table."

I smiled, "You are the mother of an Ascendant - the first of her kind."

Anabel nodded and I smiled at her, "And then we begin."
