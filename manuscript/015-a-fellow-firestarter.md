## A Fellow Firestarter

I was still running my fingers through my hair straigtening it out.  Dorian was watching me.  I asked him, "What?"

He grinned at me.  "I thought I was vain."

I stuck my tongue out at him.  "It's in my face.  It's annoying."

Dorian stopped and turned me towards him and ran his fingers through my hair and it decided to stay put.  "That will teach you to keep the top so long."

He started walking and I fell in step.  "Does my hair bother you?"  I asked in not quite so seriousness.  I didn't really care if it did.

"Not at all.  I already told you I liked it. Colored tips and everything."

I was serious this time.  "Does anything bother you about my apperance?  Upset your image too far?  I can tone it down."

Dorian sighed.  "You go from flippant to serious in two seconds flat, don't you?"

I grinned at him, "Usually, there is no serious."

"Ah."  Dorian continued.  "No.  You have always had a bold statement.  Always more flamboyant that I am.  But you've grown up.  I expect your repretoire of t-shirts has only gotten worse, but you aren't loud and obnoxious.  You've come into being a normal person."

I laughed. "I've been out in the real world where my ecentricies were barely noticed so why bother."

We stopped in front the doors to one of the training rooms.  Dorian opened the door and let me step in first.  There was no flirting to his movments, his hand stayed by his side and I missed that warm contact, but this was business and I could play my part.  I knew I could.

A boy sat slung over the arm the chairs like he was some pin up cat and worth more than the paper he was printed on.  I was not impressed.  He reminded me of me...  I guess I had grown up a little anyway.

His dark eyes never moved from his phone in his hands.  "Levi."  Dorian said as he shut the door.  "Levi."  Dorian's anger was apparent now in his voice.  And yet the lad still didn't answer.  

Dorian was starting to say his name again but I used a weave of air and fire and made his seat hot.  The boy jumped out of his seat and stared at us with a look that I was sure he wished could kill.

I smiled at him.  "I got this, Dorian."

Dorian nodded. "Okay.  I'll be watching."

I knew he would.  It was a testing room, on the other side of the mirror on the far wall was a room for observers to watch a given test.  Usually for authenticity but sometimes it was used to show off a certain person's skills.  I had sat in this room many times for that express purpose.

"My name is Nox.  You are Levi.  I would appreciate it if you sat down in the now cool seat and talk with me.  I'd hate to have to make it very uncomfortable in here."  I let a flow of fire encase us along the walls.  His eyes opened wide and he sat down quickly.  I smiled at him.  "Good."

The fire winked out as I took a seat opposite of Levi.  "Tell me about yourself."

He just looked at me.  "Alright.  Dorian can you get me his file?"

"While we wait for that, I'll tell you my story."

Levi rolled his eyes at me.  "As if I care."

I shrugged. "Don't care if you do.  You will listen."

Again his eyes rolled and I wanted to slap him.  But I smiled at him.  "Again my name is Nox.  I was born to my human mother."  

The look on his face was close to a sneer.  He stood up.  "I don't want a fucking half human shit for a mentor."

I laughed.  "You won't get better than me."  At that moment I wove a fierce storm of air, water, fire and earth.  Every single thread around me was visible to the naked eye - even a human couldn't miss the swirling patterns around me.  It was a chaotic symphony of power.  It did nothing but showcase what I was.  It was an impressive scene but it was a useless lesson to be taught.  "I am also a natural born Cesari."

The look on his face said he didn't know what that was.  "I can bend all four elements at the same time."

Levi shrugged.  "So can I."  

My show ended abruptly as Dorian opened the door.  "Did I miss the show?"  He asked.

I shrugged.  "Little good it did.  Why didn't you tell me he was Cesari?"

Dorian frowned.  "Because he's yet to prove it to us.  I figured you could tell either which way."

I sighed.  "I didn't look."

Dorian nodded. "Do you want me to stay?"

"Nah, that's alright."  I smiled at Dorian.  "I got this."

His smile was brief and he headed back out the door.

Levi was still sitting in the chair, but more like a proper person than a sloth.  "You like him, don't you?"

"Very perceptive of you."

He shrugged.  "I just see things."

I asked, "What do you see?"

Levi shrugged again.  "It's hard to explain."

"Try me."

"I see connections.  Like strings attached to people."

I was fascinated.  "So each string represents a relationship?  Does the thickness tell you anything?  Or the length?"

Levi shrugged.  

"Tell me what you saw between Dorian and I?  and say Dorian and you?"

"I can't see my own connections."

"That's understandable.  I can't see my own aura either."

Levi sat forward, "You see auras?  What's that?"

"I see the pattern around people.  I know you are Cesari, level 4, natural born.  But I don't see aura's like a human might.  They aren't colors that mean something.  I see a persons gift with the elements."

"So you can see what a person is before they even know?"  He asked.

I nodded.  "I can.  I can teach someone to do it, but it's harder the older they get."

"Can I teach you what I see?"

"No.  Not likely.  My ability isn't the seeing the auras of people it's the ability to figure out patterns.  It see the complicated and make it simple.  To find the answer quickly.  Just knowing what the pattern does without having to experiment."

"Oh."  He seemed deflated.

"But I can help you read your own talent.  If you tell me what you see.  Between me and Dorian - Mr. Vega."

"It was a light pink which I've figure out usually means a new love.  Your end looked thicker and his thinner."

"Any idea what that might mean?"  I knew, I grinned.

"How much love you feel for the other person?"  I nodded.  "So you have great feelings for him and he only a little for you.  That's sad."

"Not really.  The fact that you see it at all is hope to me.  I've liked Dorian for many many years.  It stands to reason I'm father along than he is."  I asked my next question, "What do you think the color means?"

He shrugged and I continued my line of questions trying to let him figure that out.  "Seen any other colors?"

"Yeah."  Levi nodded emphatically.  "All kinds.  Reds, greens, blue and black predominatley".

"Can you peg an emotion with those colors?"  I asked.

"So you are saying that I can tell what kind of relationship it is by the color?"

I nodded.  "That's the working theory of others who have that particular skill.  There is always room for improvement and understanding."

I changed the topic.  "Do you actively use all four elements?"

"I don't know."  Levi shrugged and looked at the wall mirror.  "I just do it."

"I know the feeling."  I leaned back in my chair.  "I revealed myself as Cesari when I was 10 when I made that statue down in the lobby.  I didn't think anything of it.  I was rushing the project so I did it all at the same time not individually like I had been taught.  I had wanted to get back to the rest of that day."

"What day was that?"  Levi asked.

"It was the annual war games and art show.  Every student is tasked with creating either a peice of art or recreating an implement of war in it's full glory, or how we envisioned it.  Left to my own devices I would have done a catapult or trebuchet but my mentor, Dae'lin, insisted that year I do an art project.  She said, and I quote, 'you are more than a killing machine as a hunter, you will act like it.'"

The irony of it really.  Thinking back on it now that statement could very well be the downfall of my career at least my mark on hunter society. The Venatori court system hate hearing my name.

"Have you used all four elements?"  I asked again.  "Can you show me something - anything?"

Levi nodded and wove a complex pattern and I watched carefully as he made tiny changes that were not exactly correct, but something about the pattern nagged at me.  When the pattern was complete it was the shape of a box, but it didn't do anything just sat there. I asked.  "What does it do?"

Levi shrugged.  "Dunno."

Something was oddly familiar with the box.  "Make it go away now."

Levi said very matter of factly. "I don't know how."

"Alright.  I'll do it then.  Won't be as easy to unravel since I didn't make it."

"Wait, you can unravel a creation?  Could I unravel your peice of art down stairs?"

I shook my head.  "No, once an object takes solid form it can't be unraveled, it beocomes real, not just magic.  This is not an object persay.  It still looks like patterns, not like a rock or sand or even water, it's just threads of light, those who can bend all four elements can see.  And because of the intracacy and delicate threads I doubt anyone could see it if they were just seeing one thread of it."

Levi nodded.

I stood up and looked directly at the mirror.  "Dorian, I'm gonna go take Levi to see Jace's class. You want to come?"

I knew the answer would be yes, but I didn't wait for one.  "Come on Levi.  I want you to meet a friend and maybe we'll sit in on his beginner class."

"I'm not a beginner."

"You are if you can't dismantle your own creation.  But I don't beleive you are a beginner.  But it's never to late to see how the younger kids are taught.  You might pick up a few tricks."

I opened the door and let Levi go first.  I followed him out and was greated with a smile from Dorian.  "You think I'm going to let you go alone?"

I grinned at him.  "Didn't dream of it."

Levi groaned.  I asked him, "What?  Making you uncomfortable."

He shook his head. "No.  Whatever cranks your chain.  You two are sappy."

I laughed.  "I have never in my life been called sappy before."

Dorian only shook his head as we walked to the elevator.  I took a deep breath as we stood waiting.  I would not lean on Dorian.  I would not show weakness to a troubled child who would and could use it against me.

Dorian watched me from the corner of his eyes.  I felt that tug to go to him and ease my fears.
