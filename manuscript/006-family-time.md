## Family Time

Mia took the elevator and I went with her in the plate glass elevator.  She wasn't even tall enough that I could easily hide my fears against her body like I did with her husband.  But she wrapped her arm around my waist and leaned her body against mine - a comforting support hug.  I adored Mia.  She took care of me better than Jace did.  I was more than happy when Jace finally popped the question.

We'd known Mia for years upon years.  She was a year younger than us in the Academy and she ran in the same circle as us outside in the human world.  She like me was raised by the community.  Her parents were from way out west - Hawaii and couldn't live in New York as they ran the island's Venatori contingent.  And who wants to give up their post when your daughter becomes Magnus.  She didn't spark, but the ability came young and she's been her two years less than Jace and I.

She used to hate me.  Which meant she hated Jace.  That was until we ran into her in the same forbidden circles of the human world doing things her parents wouldn't be proud of.  We struck up a friendship and she of all things asked Jace out.  I was never jealous - Mia was never more than a friend to me.  Though we had shared a few moments of pleausre together though the circumstances were not something that we discussed at all.  

Mia squeezed my waist and brought me back to the real world.  "What you thinking about?"

I grinned.  "You and Jace.  How we met."

"Ah.  No wonder the litle drool coming out of your mouth."  I heard the humor in her voice but I had already reached up and wiped the non-existant drool from my mouth.  "Got you. Next floor we get off on.  We can take the stairs after that."

"Okay."  I straighted up and wrapped an arm around Mia's shoulders as she still clung to my waist for comfort.  "Jace is a lucky man."

Mia laughed.  "He is.  Isn't he?  Got me for a wife and you for a best friend.  Can't ask for anything better."

"I was talking about you, but yeah I guess he's got it made now.  Two perfect children, a loving wife, a best friend who's like his brother and house out in the suburbs."

"You sound almost jealous, Nox."  Mia pulled away and took a step back as the bell dinged open on our floor.

We walked down the Academy's lowest level where the day care facilities are and headed for Naya's class first.  I managed to say.  "I am, actually," just as Naya burst out of her class room with the other kids.  She skidded to a hault when she saw me standing there and walked casually up to her mother and gave her a hug.

"Hi Mom."  Mia nodded with a whisper, "Go ahead."

She didn't walk to me - she ran the few steps it took to get to me and jumped into my arms.  "Uncle Nox."

"Hey babe."  She wrapped her arms around my neck and squeezed tight.  I shifted her so she wouldn't be knocking my duffle bag into me the whole time and she settled into me like an old rag doll as we went to go get JJ.  

The toddler aged children were another cooridor over and JJ was happily playing with his friends until his mother gave a little whistle and his ears perked up.  His head lifted over the half wall separating the toys from the classroom and he hurriedly put his toys away when he saw me holding his sister.  If there was anything that boy hated it was sharing hugs with me.  

JJ didn't even bother with a Hi Mom as Naya had. He walked straight up to me.  He punched me in the thigh and Mia scolded him.  "We do not hit Jason Hill Junior.  You know this, even if it is Uncle Nox and he deserves it."

She winked up at me.  "Now because of that you don't get to see him until we get home."

I leaned my head back fighting the urge to say something but this was her son.  And I had no say in the matter.  She was right - no hitting, but I didn't even get a hug from the little man.

JJ startd crying as Mia hoisted him up on her hip with my backpack and we started walking towards the stairs.  "We can take the elevator, Mia.  It'll be easier."

Mia sighed with relief, I could see it written all over her face.  JJ was not making it easy.  Once in the elevator Mia had a private conversation with JJ in the corner.  I leaned against the wooden rail and buried my face in Naya's hair.  It smelled like lavendar which I knew both the younger the Hill's hair did.  It was something Mia did to calm them in their evening baths.  It was a calming scent though not enough to completely remove the anxiety from the elevator.  

Naya whispered in my ear.  "I got you, Uncle Nox.  Nothing to be afraid of."

I grinned across at her.  "Thanks babe."

Another group of parents got in the elevatore a floor down.  A small voice spoke up to us.  "Hi Naya."

Naya scrambled down from my embrace and stood a little under that little girl.  "Hi Cat."  Naya looked nervous.  

The little girl asked Naya, "Is this the boyfriend you are always talking about?"

I raised my eyebrow and Naya blushed.  But she didn't confirm nor deny the fact.  Not good.  What had she been saying?  I looked to Mia and she mouthed, "This is your fault."

I sighed and nodded.  It was.  I flirted with Naya as I flirted with everyone else.  Mia and Jace hadn't said anything when she was younger and once she got older it was difficult to stop.  I would fix this though.

The little girl continued to bully Naya.  "Isn't he a little old for you, what's he like 20?"

Twenty was old?  Damn, kids these days.  Naya was about to say something when I put my hand on her shoulder.  I knelt down and was eye level with both the girls.  "I'm twenty -nine thank you very much.  And I'm not Naya's boyfriend.  I'm her uncle."  I waved my hand in front of the girls and a small ball of fire winked into existance.  The little girl paled.

Naya spoke, "I told you he was good."  She sounded more cocky than I did.  Naya waved her hand like I had and a smaller version of the fireball winked into existance above her palm.  "I have the best tutor in the world."

The little girl stammered and sputtered.  "Mine is better."

Naya laughed.  "Highly doubtful.  Is he Cesari too?"

I stood up and let the fireball wink out as I covered her hand and extinguished Naya's too.  "Okay that's enough.  I am not some thing you brag about Naya."

I looked across at the other parent.  The little girl giggled, "That's my Nanny. She won't say anything to me."

I grinned.  "Please turn around ma'am."  The woman grinned and did as I asked.

I didn't touch the little girl but I flared my power around me and she felt the soffocating pressence.  "You bother Naya again and you will have to deal with me."

The little girl's eyes were wide with fear.  I could smell the aweful stench on her.  On everyone in the elevator.  The elevator dinged on the bottom floor and I pushed Naya ahead of me out the door - Mia followed.

It took me a few moments to reign in my presense.  It was a trick I'd learned so I didn't stand out.  Most Magnus didn't have that control.  But when control is beaten into you as a child you tend to remember such lessens.

Mia took a deep breath.  "Jesus, Nox."

"I'm sorry."  I really was I hadn't meant to scare them too.

JJ giggled, "That was awesome."

I gave him a half grin while we waited for Jace in front of the statue they had nicknamed Atlas.  I had created it when I was 10 - proving to the world that I was Cesari.

Naya asked, "Did you really make this, Uncle Nox?"

Mia nodded, "He sure did.  It was one of his greatest acheivements."

I smiled at Mia.  It wasn't an acheivement I was doing what I was told - art.  I didn't know that what I had done was near impossible - working all four elements at the same time.  Everything but the ants and the grass seeds I had created from nothing.  The large globe above his head was it's own little world.  I had applied our life cycle science to the globe - the greenhouse effect to make a completely isolated world inside the globe.  It sustained itself year round without any interference and it had for the past 19 years.

Jace came up and stopped before me and frowned, "Why do you feel so much more powerful right now?"  He looked at me with a disapproving glare, "What did you do?"

Naya stepped between me and her father with her hands on her hips.  "He was standing up for me."

"Cat?"

She nodded.  "She was picking on me about Uncle Nox."

I sighed.  "Which you need to stop calling me your boyfriend Naya."  I turned her around and knelt down.  "I love you.  You know this.  But you are my family.  That is what I am."

She looked hurt and I didn't blame her I had no tact.  Jace put his hand on his daughters shoulder, "You'll learn to live with it."

My heart sank.  He knew all too well the feeling of loving me without my feelings returned in the same way.  When we were younger Jace had wanted more.  More than just the friendship we had shared.  More than the shared experiences.  More than I could give him.  He was my brother, my family.  My only connection to the world that made life worth living.  He eventually understood why I couldn't be more.

Mia put her hand on my waist and guided me towards their car.  She walked slower than the others, Jace had taken JJ and my bag from her and was walking at a rather fast pace with Naya chattering away at him about what I'd done.  Mia spoke softly, "He understands yu know?"

I nodded.  "I know, but it doesn't hurt any less for either of us."

Mia sighed, "If you'd been with him, Nox.  He wouldn't be with me - not ever."

"I know that too.  You are one reason.  I'm the main one though."  I sighed.  "I do love him.  And it's not that I'm not attracted to him."

"He knows.  You come up often after you've been gone a long time.  And not during sex or afterwards.  Just randomly he'll curl up against his pillow away from me.  And when I ask him what's wrong - he just misses you.  Misses having you around.  You are staying for a while right?"  Mia sounded concerned, "He really needs you."

I nodded.  "That's the plan."  I stopped and turned towards Mia.  "I want to start my own family.  I want what ya'll have."

Mia's face lit up like a beacon.  "That's wonderful Nox."  And it fell nearly as fast.  "That means you have to let someone in."

"Yeah.  I'm thinking kids will be easier.  I've already been propositioned once and I'm assuming there will be more who want a possible Cesari in their bloodline."  I truly hated the world I lived in sometimes.  But it is what it is.

"Wow.  That was fast.  Who?"

"The Dowager line - Anabel's mother specifically came to me about her daughter."

"I know Anabel.  She's a sweet girl.  Heading off to nursing school like I did."

"I haven't given her an answer yet.  I want to do some digging."

Mia laughed.  "Of course you do."

We reached the car.  Naya and JJ were already inside.  But Naya was bouncing around the seat.  "I better get in before she hurts herself."

Mia nodded.  "They love having you here Nox."

"I know."  I got in and sat in the middle seat.  It was uncomfortable but I got to see both kids and they were more than happy to have me sitting there.  Which made it all that better.

Jace drove home and the adults up front held their own private conversation while I chatted with the kids.  I found out JJ was being a bully so we had a deep discussion about what being a better person meant.  I don't think he got it.  But I think he at least understood some of what I said to him.

Naya on the other hand was the one being bullied and I showed her how to do what I'd done.  To be threatening without actually threatening.  Her power was still new to her, but she was learning quickly.  Jace looked at me and gave me a frown in the rear view mirror.  I was teaching his children things he'd rather not have them know.  But what was done was done.  You don't unforget knowledge quite so easily.

The kids ran inside carrying my bags and Mia followed them inside.  "Dinner will be ready in an hour, you two."

We both nodded, "Yes ma'am" I said and Jace shook his head.

"You really shouldn't teach my kids that stuff."  Jace sighed, "JJ's already doing things we think he saw from you."

"Like what?"

"Viels in particular."  Jace said.  "He's always hiding things so we can't find them."

"On purpose?"  I asked.

"He says no, but..."  Jace trailed off rubbing the stubble at his chin.

I grinned at him.  "I can help with that.  I doubt he knows what he's doing.  It's an easy trick to learn and to not know you are doing it.  I did."

Jace nodded.  "You didn't specifically show him did you?"

I shook my head.  "Not on purpose anyway." I removed my personal veil I usually kept up and Jace nodded.  "Something I do out of habit."

Jace sighed, "I don't know why you just don't get those scars taken care of."

"That would make people ask questions.  Questions I don't want to answer."

Jace shook his head.  "I don't know why not.  Everyone who's seen them would love to know the truth."

"Noone would beleive me anyway."  I headed for the door.  "I'm going for a swim."

"It's like 50 out."  Jace called after me shutting the cargo door in the SUV.

"I can fix that, remember?"

I went for a swim and the kids splashed around in the pool with me.  Dinner was roasted chicken covered in herbs and a decadant lemon sauce with mashed sweet potatoes and a healthy serving of wild rice.  One of my favorite dishes Mia knew how to cook.  We chatted through dinner - school projects, me being home indefinately.  Mia offered me a place on her couch whenever I wanted.

The kids were sent to their rooms for homework and lessons and I went for a run. 

By the time I got back the kids were in bed and Mia and Jace were settling in themselves.  I took a shower then laid down on the couch.  I had an early morning.  I wasn't looking forward to getting up in front of smart people to talk about my theories.  Theories I could only bet the would laugh at.
