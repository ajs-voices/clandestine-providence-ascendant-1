## The Last Request of the Demon

We left Dorian's parents place and walked the three flights of stairs down to his apartment and went inside where Dorian pulled out a beer out of the fridge and handed it to me.  I grinned at him as I saw the Red Irish label sticking out under his hand.  "Have you been asking about me again?"

Dorian blushed slightly.  "No.  Well maybe a little.  But I didn't ask Jason what you liked to drink."

I took a step into Dorian and popped the top of the bottle with a pattern of air and took sip and savored the flavor.  "What exactly did you ask him then?"

He looked up at me with a smile of his own.  "What would make you more comfortable while you were at my place."

"And he suggested Irish Red?"  I asked.

Dorian blushed.  "That wasn't his first suggestion."

I raised an eyebrow.  "And that was?"

"He said if I wasn't always so formal - suggested taking off my clothes."  Dorian chuckled, "Which I took a little to literally to which he had a fit of laughter over my embarassement before he amended his statement.  If I was comfortable you'd be comfortable.  He said don't touch his back unless invited and always keep Irish Red on hand, he doesn't like wine too much."

"I'm getting a taste for it."  I continued in a whisper, "You can do anything to me without being invited Dorian."  Dorian kissed me eagerly just as there was rap at the door and Dorian sighed.

I froze and Dorian noticed.  He took me by the hand and lead me to the living room. "Sit on the couch.  I'll get the door."  I followed his instructions and Dorian went to answer the door.

I heard Garrett's voice over the blood rushing in my ears.  "Dorian Vega.  It's been a while.  I assume you know why I'm here."

"Come in."  I heard the door shut behind Dorian and their footsteps falling on the tiles in Dorian's apartment.  

Dorian sat down next to me and I fished the paper I'd folded up in my pocket and after Garrett sat down on the chair  nearest the door I set it down on the table.  "That's what you asked for."

Garrett picked it up and looked it over.  "Such neat handwriting.  No one would supsect you were queer."

I rolled my eyes at him but I said nothing.  Garrett laughed and took it further.  "You never were good at hiding that aspect from anyone."

"I wasn't trying to hide."  I bit back.  "I like who I am."  I sat forward and leaned my elbows against my knees as I stood up to Garrett for the first time in my life.  What was wrong with me.  Dorian's hand on my knee was a comfort and gave me strength to stand up to him.  "I like men.  I do not like you."

Garrett laughed.  "The boy does have a spine.  How very unusual.  Maybe your pretty boyfriend here is actually good for you."

"Leave him out of this."

"If you wanted him left out of this then you shouldn't have invited me over here."  Garrett slide forward.  "Now I want you to do something else for me."  Garrett put the paper back on the coffee table.  "You will take this list and you will kill Mark Green for me."

He grinned evilly and I could feel Dorian freeze with his hand against my knee.  "You will do it, or your precious pretty boy and his little red-headed ex-lover and his son will pay the price."

Garrett didn't try to hide the patterns of air he created.  They were intermingled with air and earth.  "It seams you are a rather intelligent young man.  I've learned a lot listening to your lectures as of late."

My heart caught in my throat.  Twice now something I've done has given bad people an advantage.  Garrett's weave of air and earth dangled closely to Dorian and he stood his ground staring at them himself.  Garrett laughed.  "You see the boy isn't lying."  Garrett stood up and walked to the door.  "You have two weeks.  And I'll be taking Stella and Aidan away on an extended vacation.  I will be having a grand time with your family Dorian.  She is a feisty one.  And the boy's flesh is so very tender."

Dorian moved to get up but I caught him with a weave of air as he stood up.  I knew he was angry.  I knew he would try to hurt Garrett and Garrett would win this battle.  Dorian turned to glare at me as Garret left the building.

Dorian looked at me. "Why did you stop me?"

I didn't look at him.  "I didn't want him to hurt you."  I buried my face in my hands and I could feel the tears of anger tricking down my cheeks.  

I felt Dorian sit down next to me and took my chin in his hand and turned me to look at him.  He wiped the hot tears from my cheeks and chuckled, "You are ruining the makeup again."

I smiled at him.  "I'm sorry you are involved in this."

Dorian sighed.  "I wouldn't be anywhere else."  He wrapped his arm around me shoulder and pulled me against him and leaned back against the back of the couch craddling me in his lap.  "What are you going to do?"

"I don't know know."  I sounded hopeless.  The situation was hopeless.  If I didn't do it then Dorian would get hurt in more ways than one, but then if I did I would be no better than the rogue monsters we hunt.  Though with in our own rules I could legally challenge Mark and then I'd be a puppet to whatever agened Garrett and his crew were after.

"I suppose I should go to Mark Green and tell him and deal with whatever consequences."

I could feel Dorian nodding.  "I will go with you."

"No Dorian, I will deal with this on my own.  If you are found to know about this they could exile you or worse.  I can't do that to you."

He sighed, "You know that's what he wants.  For you to protect me.  Even in this.  Nox, I could help."

I shook my head.  "No love you can't.  You will reap nothing but the horrors of my life."

Dorian held me in silence for the better part of hour while I sulked in his lap.  He kissed the top of my head.  "You should tell him sooner rather than later.  Go now, and then come back to me Nox."

He pushed me into a sitting position and took my chin in his hands and kissed me throughly.  When he pulled away he spoke softly.  "Promise me we'll deal with this together.  Tell Mark Green, and whatever he says we will deal with together."

I nodded, knowing that if I were thrown into the courts or into to exile I might not get a chance to come back to Dorian.  "But..."

Dorian shook his head.  "Even if you are exiled Nox for this, you will call me as soon as possible.  I want you to say it."

I sighed.  "I promise whatever happens we'll deal with this together."

Dorian stood up and offered me a hand and helped me up.  He wiped away my tears with his thumbs and smiled.  "You are at least presentable.  Now go before I follow you."

I followed my orders and I headed to the top floor where Mark Green and Asher Eriksen kept their residences.
