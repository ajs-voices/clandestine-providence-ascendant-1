# Part I: The Dawning

## Fear of Flying

My flight out of Denver International Airport was early but not too early at least not for me.  By the time most people's alarm clocks were going off I was already up, had a quick work out and was showered.  I had a light breakfast - completely not my usual thing consisting of cereal and milk - a sugared cereal at that.  It was all the free Continental breakfast had at this early hour that I would eat.  There was plenty of food just nothing I was overly fond of.  Things like pastries and donuts or other sugary type foods.  

But this morning was already stressful might as well add a bad breakfast to it as well.  I was thankful that my trip through security wasn't too bad well unless of course you count rude men and crying babies.  Security had a long line.  In front of me was a man wearing a fedora and a long trench-coat.  He looked like the kinda guy who you'd worry about having a bomb underneath that jacket.  But he shed it like the rest of us, hat and all and waited for his turn to place his things on the conveyor belt.

In front of him was a small redhead toting around a toddler.  The toddler wasn't happy with situation and started screaming when the woman tried to take off his shoes.  Instead of offering to help or politely waiting the man in front of me went around her - butt in front of her with a side remark.  "You shouldn't travel alone miss."

The look the small redhead gave him mimicked my thoughts exactly _How rude!_ but I didn't say anything either.  I stood behind her and watched as she struggled with the little man and he refused to be put down and she couldn't hold him.  I asked, "Do you need some help?"

The woman looked up and frowned then shook her head.  "I got this."  She looked back down to fiddle with her son's shoe.  I'm sure she was reacting to my outer apperance, the t-shirt under a hoodie with holey jeans that were all the rage.  I'm sure the eye liner and red tips in my hair that hung over my right eye didn't help matters either.  I probably looked like some wanna-be goth emo kid to her.  But I couldn't help but chuckle at the irony because she clearly did not have this.  

I asked. "Are you sure?"

She nodded.  "Yeah."  But she didn't sound very convincing.

I gently moved her hands from the tiny shoe and carefully untied the knotted laces that were giving a one handed momma a hard time.  The shoe slipped off quickly and she looked relieved.  "Thanks, I guess," she said to me as she placed all of her things on the belt and stepped through the medal detectors without being further assaulted.  

I didn't have the same luck.  I was randomly chosen to be searched a little more throughly, I hadn't even stepped through the metal detector when the man pulled me aside and started waving the wand over my long arms.  He was a short stocky man build like a truck.  But when the wand neared my junk I had to comment despite the beat down I was likely to get.  "Don't ya think you should be me a drink first?"

The man gave me this look that was a cross between pissed off and completely taken back.  I grinned at him.  "Sorry, man, had to lighten the mood."

The security officer rolled his eyes and went back to work.  As a parting gift he used the small want to swat my backside.  I turned around with a laugh, "Next you buy me drinks first!"

He let out a loud guffaw and went back to work.  At least some people can take a joke I wasn't always so lucky.  I'd been beat down on a regular basis because of my sexual preferences.  I'm not saying I don't like women because I do - a lot.  I just also happen to like men.  And bigotry and homophobic tendencies run high in the land of the free.  Everyone seems entitled to their right way - sure the land of the free is free but only if you are exactly like us.  Dicks!  

I knew my train of thought was only going to make shit worse when I actually got on the plane so I found a stall that sold water and I bought two bottles and a cheap magazine to read while I waited in the terminal to distract my mind.  But I can't stop being me even when I know it causes people to stair at me.  The magazine was a teeny-bopper glam magazine meant for teenage girls.  I was far from teenage and short of the eyeliner I applied everyday I wasn't really into make up.

The terminal was empty except for a one other passenger, and elderly lady with an oxygen tank sitting next to her seat.  I sat two seats away from her.  I was a social butterfly.  Jace asked me more than once, "Do you ever not talk to people?"

I could only shrug at my best friends question.  I was looking for something in someone.  I don't know what.  But I wanted people to make up their mind about me out of the gate so I could move on.  People were dicks in most cases.  They refused to talk to you or they ignored you.  Even when I didn't hit on them, they were still dicks.

I dropped the magazine in the chair between us and the woman looked down and then back up at me and I grinned at her.  "You can read it.  I'm sure a lovely young lady like yourself doesn't need any tips, but hey it can't hurt either, can it?"

The woman smiled at me and for a woman her age I was certain those were her real choppers.  I grinned at her, "Great smile."

The elderly woman turned a pretty shade of rose and waved her hand in front of her.  Bingo!  Job well done.  I added, "I'm sure all the gentleman at home notice too."

The blush deepened just as a woman sat across from us.   From the way she'd plopped down in the seat she had a rough time of something.  I beamed my best smile at her and continued with the charade, "This must be your sister."  It was likely she was her daughter or grand-daughter judging by her age, but if I were take a guess she was a spitting image of the older woman.

The elderly woman's blush was all but gone at the compliment, "Oh dear no.  This is my grand-daughter, Erin."  

"A pleasure.  Nox."  I turned back towards the elderly woman and offered her my hand, "And what may I call you other than sweet-thing?"

I gained another slight blush as the woman too my hand in hers.  "It's Erin too." 

"A pleasure, Erin."  I raised her hand to my lips and could smell the tale-tell signs of a hospital on her - she was clearly from a nursing home or a stint in the actual hospital.  I kissed the top of her middle knuckle and she pulled her hand from my light grip.

"You indulge an old lady.  You shouldn't waste your flattery on me.  My grand-daughter would be far better suited for it."  She chided.

I laughed, "Duckling, she probably hears all that all the time.  You on the other hand are a doll and I'm sure no one tells you enough."  I patted the magazine on the chair between us - tapping at the biggest article on the cover "How to be better in bed".  She glanced down at my tapping and blushed.  "I wasn't lying when I told you you probably didn't need any advice on the topic.  I'm sure you are a wild cat."

She lowered her head and I could see the rose color rising to her ears.  The younger version of her self picked up the magazine and tossed it at me.  "Leave my grandmother alone you pervert!"

Score number 2 I managed to piss off the young one.  "Pervert?  That's all you got?"

The younger Erin rolled her eyes at me and helped her grandmother stand.  "Nana, let's move over here so you can rest in peace."

I called out after them, "Ms. Erin, don't let them put you in the grave before you are ready.  We are only as old as we think we are."  I added as a second thought, "And nice ass."

I could hear the younger woman grumbling as she walked away from me with her grandmother in tow.  I listened to their conversation for a short while before I notice a small hand wiggling it's way towards the magazine.  A boy of about 3 years old was sneaking the magazine from my lap.  I looked around for his mother and found her busy trying to situated the stroller, a car seat and several small bags into a means to carrying them all and her son. 

I handed the boy the magazine and picked him up in my lap.  He turned and sat down with the magazine in his lap and flipped to the first page.  I started reading, figured that's what he wanted.  It was the Table of Contents but hey, the kid didn't care.  The moment I read the "How to be better in bed" title the redhead looked up, snatched her son from my lap and glared at me.  Her little voice squeaked before she was actually able to make any words come out of her mouth, "How dare you?  First you assault that old woman and now you assault my son - again!"

I shrugged.  "If that's how you want to see it fine by me.  But you should pay more attention to your son, he was over hear trying to take it from me."

She turned a color almost as read as her hair.  "I'm so sorry.  That was uncalled for."

"No harm no foul."  I stood up so I wasn't looking up at her, not something I enjoyed, being 6'0" I was usually the one being looked up to.  "Name is Nox.  Let me help you.  Reorganize your gear, or hold your son while you do it.  I'm getting on this plane and I'm not going anywhere until it leaves.  I give you my word."  I held up two fingers in scout's honor.  

She laughed, which was better than yelling at me.   I handed her my ticket.  "You hold this to prove I'm not going anywhere."

She looked down at it and then at her ticket in her pocket and sighed. "It seems I won't be getting away from you any this morning."  She held up her ticket and the seat was right next to mine.  

I smiled.  "I'll behave.  Promise."

I took the little boy from her hands and sat back down on my seat with the magazine in our laps and we pointed out pictures.  He was pretty good at finding even tiny little letters in the print.  A smart kid.

She started fixing her things again and then looked up at me and her son with what I could only explain as fear I had left with her son.  I smiled at her to reassure her but I doubted that would work.  She spoke to me a few moments after going back to her work.  "Stella, and that's Aidan."

I nodded.  "A pleasure.  I'd offer you my hand but it seems both of them are rather occupied."  Aidan had taken to moving my hands to open and close the magazine and he was giggling softly to himself.

Stella giggled herself and sat down across from us and watched her son play.  I spent the greater part of my wait tending to the squirming child in my lap.  I missed Jace's kids.  I was glad that he was picking me up when I landed.  It would be good to see JJ and Naya.

A woman, who was clearly a stewardess, came over to us and looked at me.  "Would you like to board first?"

I looked up and was surprised to see Cindy - a regular flight attendant on other trips out of town just not usually to New York.  She frowned and then smiled.  "I didn't know you had a son."

I laughed.  "I don't.  This is her son.  I don't want to sit on that death trap any longer than I already have to." I looked across the floor to Stella, "Do you want to get on first?  I'm pretty sure she meant to ask you."

Stella looked up at her.  "No, we'll board when he does, he's rather helpful."

I laughed. The stewardess smiled sweetly at me.  "Alright, sweetie.  I'll see you on board."  She winked at me. 

Stella was staring at me.  "Friend of yours?" she asked.

I shrugged.  "A girl I slept with."

"So you really are that playboy? You weren't just being nice to an older woman."  She sounded like that was a bad thing.

"At least you know what you get."  I said with my inflated ego voice.

Stella rolled her eyes at me as the intercom called the first rows.  "Why didn't you want to get on early?  It'd have been easier."

"Afraid of flying.  I'm putting it off as long as I can. So my anxiety doesn't spike prematurely."

Stella laughed, "Does that happen often?"

Oh I liked her.  I grinned at her.  "No.  I make sure they are satisfied before hand."

The rose color of her embarrassment rushed to her face and she took Aidan from my hands and sniffed his bottom then wrinkled her nose.  I laughed.  "That's sexy."

And I was rewarded with a deepening red as she sat her son in her lap trying to look all casual like.  But she didn't try to speak.

I winked at her.  "Come on, let's get on the plane so you can change him."

Standing up I grabbed her things and mine but Stella hesitated.  "But.."

"I'll be fine."  I offered her a hand up with a grin.  She took it carefully adjusting her son to her hip.  Her hand was warm and I could smell the sweet scent of roses as she drew near.  Aidan didn't smell like he needed to be changed to me, but then again I wasn't focusing on that.  It must be a mother thing.  

Stella had our three tickets in her hands and I had everything else except Aidan and we stood impatiently in line to get on the stupid, flying, death trap they called an airplane.  I really hated airplanes.  ## Distractions

I was afraid of flying, it wasn't the airplanes fault, or the pilots.  It was my mother's fault.

I had just turned five when I was on my first flight.  It probably wouldn't have been so bad if it were not for the fact that only hours before my mother was spiting at me and calling me a monster.  And hours before that I had sparked.  I watched as a time flicker of flame caught fire on the curtains.  I remember it clear as day.

I remember that tiny little pattern coalesce and form and take light with only my thoughts to guide it.  I know it was me.  I knew then it was me.  My mother knew it was me too.  

I took a deep breath and swallowed the memory into the depths of my mind again.  I disliked thinking about her - about my mother - the woman who gave me away without a second thought.  I hated her.  I could hear Margo's words screaming back at me now.  _"You don't hate her.  You are angry.  You have every right to be but hate is a very strong word."_  It was something she said to me often when the topic of my mother came up.

There was a warm hand with rose scent wafting up from my arm that brought me back to my senses.  Stella asked, "You okay?  We are almost there."

I nodded my head.  I didn't trust my words as I shifted our things to the other side so I could get my ID out of my wallet in my back pocket.  It was a Colorado issued drivers license however I had never taken a driving test so to speak at least not in Colorado.  I had in New York City where I grew up but that was a long time ago.

The picture was a poor representation of myself but it at least looked like me.  Jace's never had, but then again he had a black eye the day he took the picture.

It wasn't the stewardess at the counter that I knew who took our tickets.  She didn't think twice about the fact that we weren't actually together.  Two separate parties but our seats were together and we looked like a happy little family, but we were complete strangers.

We walked down the narrow cat walk that connected the terminal to the airplane and I could feel my heart starting to race.  I could feel the sweat starting to form at the base of my neck.  Stella was in front of me and for that I was grateful.  She turned around to make sure I was still following and she frowned.  "You really don't like to fly do you?"

I shook my head.  "No, but I'll be fine."

Several other passengers behind us rushed passed us as we stood in the catwalk.  I drapped my arm around the tiny redhead and rubbed the little boy's shoulder and hurried us along the rest of the way.  There was no better way to do this than to just get it done.  Stella commented, "Like a band-aid."

I laughed softly, "Did I say that out loud?"

She patted my hand, "Yep."

I apologized, "Sorry.  I'll try not to let that happen again."

Stella squeezed my hand and we entered the plane single file with her things trailing behind me as I lugged everything through the narrow passage ways.  My friend greeted me at the door way and winked at me slyly.  I rolled my eyes once I was past her.  I wasn't exactly in the playing mood right now - she knew this.

Stella found our seats and stopped to set Aidan in the seat and asked, "Can I have his seat?"  

I managed to get it undone from the set up Stella had manuevered and  handed it her without knocking anyone in the head.  There were people waiting behind us to get past and I turned and apologized to them  but the were rude anyway.  I didn't hurry on principle then.

Stella got Aidan in the seat by the window strapped into his car seat and the airplane seat and she was trying to get inside the row so I could put things away.  The man behind me tried to push me and I turned and grinned at him.  "Sorry.  Women and children first."

He gave me a nasty glare.  I laughed and picked up the stroller and started to put it away in the overhead bin with the rest of our things.  I grabbed the magazine I'd bought and my earbuds from my things and sat down slowly next to Stella as she fussed with her son.  He was not happy to be strapped in from the sounds of things.

Stella busied her self with changing Aidan while we awaited on the plane. I could hear my pulse in my ears.  I knew that my palms were sweaty as I gripped the arm of the chair.  Stella patted my hand, "It'll be alright."

"It always is."  I said flatly.  "Give Aidan the magazine.  It should keep him quiet."

"He'll just eat it."  Stella said.

"No.  Trust me."

"I know my son."  I could hear the anger in her voice.

I shrugged.  "Fine."  I pulled my hand from under hears and put it in my lap and squeezed my knees instead.  I could feel the strength of my own grip and was thankful I didn't have the strength of the Venatori or I'd have bruises.

The flight attendants started their spiel and I couldn't pay attention to the words.  I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing.  This was worse than the elevators in the AU building back home.  It was a long drawn out process one I had to endure for hours.  I don't think I could actually make a flight over seas.

Stella fussed with her son over sitting still and squawking.  The plane started moving and my heart skipped a beat as I clutch my leg.  Landings and takeoffs were the worst parts.  Once the take off was complete I could zone into my headset and meditate and keep most of the anxiety at bay, but right now without the music as a distraction I was going to have issues.

A hand snuck across the chair arm and snagged the magazine.  I heard Stella, "Here.  Just stop, Aidan."  

I was too preoccuppied to notice what happened next.  The plane lifted off the ground and my stomach reeled.  I could feel it flipping inside.  I took a deep breath and held it until it hurt too much.  

Stella grabbed my hand and squeezed it and put it on the arm chair clasped under hers.  I looked over at her and notice Aidan was happily flipping through the magazine she'd taken from me.  I gave her a half smile and turned back towards the front and focused on my breathing, and not crushing Stella's delicate hand in mine. It was soft and warm.  I could smell the sweet scent of roses.  I turned my focus to the soft scent and the warmth of her hand, it helped to focus on something real - something in my control.  It was the basis of one of my anxiety rituals - five things I could see, four things I could touch, three things I could hear, two things I could smell and one thing I could taste.  

The idea of tasting pulled at more primal things inside me with a beautiful woman sitting next to me holding my hand.  I pushed away those thoughts Stella was far from my type.  Well not my type, but those I allowed myself to become involved with.  She was a mother, and likely had a significant other.  And if there wasn't, I'm not the type of guy who wants to get involved with someone who wants more than just sex.  I didn't do relationships.  I could see Margo rolling her eyes at me as I say the same thing to her.  I can feel the smack across the head from my now present father.  Don't treat women like that.  

Yet my father had more children with more woman than most Venatori.  He was a sought after sould apparently.  I was still trying to get over my past with my father.  I hated him for so many years for not being there for me.  And when I found out at my graduation from the Academy that he'd been around me my whole life.  I was pissed.  I'm still pissed.  Though Margo would remind me that I'm not angry at him.  He was a victim too.  He hadn't known about me until I knew about him.  I shouldn't blame him.

A call over the intercom brought me back to the present.  Stella squeezed my hand and I turned my attention back to her.  "You okay?" she asked.

I nodded.  "Yeah."  I squeezed her hand and pulled from of her warm grip.  "Thanks."

She smiled at me.  It was such a prett smile underneath those great green orbs.  "You should go get a drink of water."

I shook my head and pulled a bottle of water from the pocket in my cargo pants.  Stella laughed as I cracked the top and slugged back the water.

Aidan started squawking again.  I nodded, "His ears hurt."

Stella sighed and took out a sippy cup and handed it to him.  "How do you know what he wants?"

I shrugged, "Sixth sense I guess."  It was in reality.  It wasn't a gift like empathy, it was more reading body language, and understanding what the patterns around a person meant.  It was the first time that I'd actually let my mind see what it had been seeing around Aidan the whole time.  His aura, not really the psychic kind, I didn't see those, but the way the patterns moved around him I could see things I shouldn't see.  He couldn't be Venatori.  She wasn't, she was human, I could see that.  "Why are you going to New York City or is it just a stop through?"  I had a very bad feeling about this.

Stella smiled.  "Job interview."  She frowned and then looked out the window.  I didn't even want to think of what she saw but she smiled and turned back to me.  "I lost my job a month ago.  I can't seem to land another one, but my mom talked to Aidan's father who I didn't know she was talking to until recently and he's arranged for an interview in New York City at his company."

"A dead beat father?  I know that feeling."  I said without thinking.

Stella sighed, "It's not like that.  I didn't tell him.  The day I was going to tell him, he told me he didn't love me, couldn't love me and he had to go.  I forgot about what I wanted to tell him and I asked him why and he confided that he liked men."

"So you didn't tell him you were pregnant?"  I paled.  If Aidan was Minorem - half human half Venatori like he looked to be she could have died. Fuck!  She has no idea what danger she was in.  "When did he find out?"

"My mother contacted him when she found his phone number in my phone still after Aidan had been born and she was helping me out.  She called him and told him.  She said he was ready to get on a plane and wisk me away to New York but she talked him out of it.  But here I am using his so-called connections to try and get a job."  She looked out the window again. "Apparently he works at some school and is a big wig, and they are always looking for people with my skills to help with the office work."

"What company?" I asked to confirm.

"It's some subsidary of Apex Unlimited.  They are putting me up in Hotel Pennsylvania and I have an interview at their building."  She turned to me and sat up straight in her chair and asked, "You know anything about Apex Unlimited?"

"I work for them, in a round about sort of way.  A subsidary of a subsidary or something."

She asked, "Are they good to work for?"

I nodded.  "I've never wanted for anything since being with them."  Which was true.  The Venatori took care of their own.  They didn't pay well in human standards, but you were garunteed a place to live, three squares a day and all your needs tended too.  They paid you a measley stippened for your wants.  And I had been with them a long time.  I added, "The daycare system is excellent.  Provided housing is adequate.  Their cafeteria is acceptable but I prefer to cook myself."

"What do you do for them?"  Stella asked.

I didn't know if she knew anything about my world so I had to go with the half truth.  "I'm a secuirty consultant.  I travel around the country taking care of problems for them.  I'm flying back for a conference they are having this week because I have a unique view of some of the problems."

"Oh that sounds wonderful." 

I shrugged, "I suppose.  I'm a little afraid of talking in front of this crowd.  I'm not a shy person, but these people are the big wigs of everything and I'm just a little lowly field worker.  What do I know?"

Stella took my hand in hers and squeezed it.  "Apparently more than them if they asked you to speak."

I shrugged again.  Aidan crawled out of his seat and into his mama's lap and then  into mine with the magazine.  I grinned at her.  "Apparently we are talking too much."

Stella laughed softly.  "I'm sorry.  He seems to like you."

"Kids normally do."  I grinned at her.  "Something about the age difference."

She chuckled as I put my attention to the little lap stealer and his magazine.  For the next twenty minutes while drinks and snacks were passed around Aidan and I pointed and near naked women in ads and discussed the finer points of body parts.  It was entertaining to see a three year old exclaim boobies on the plane.  Stella covered her mouth in embarassement and I could only laugh.  He was going to be a breast man.

I siped at the water I'd brought with me and refused the refreshments they had provided.  Stella instead prompted me to get her a coke and she downed both of them.  I imagined that she was up late nights with her son.  Or worrying over what she was going to do with her life.

I asked.  "Do you intend to let his father into his life?"

Stella shrugged.  "I hadn't thought about it.  I suppose I should. I mean he has tried to take care of us, but I won't let him."

I nodded.  The man was at least honorable at that rate.  And it made me realize that maybe I needed to try harder with my own father.

Stella interrupted my train of thought.  "You go blank often, what's on your mind?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing.  Just reminded how similar this is to my own childhood."

"Oh?"

"My mother left me in the care of strangers when I was five.  My father didn't know I existed until I was 18.  I hated him for not being there as a child.  But it was my mother's choice to keep him out of my life even though she wasn't in it.  I was just thinking I should try harder with my own father.  It wasn't his fault."

Stella laughed.  "You are making this up to make me feel guilty."

I shook my head and stared down the aisle in front of me.  "No.  My mother spit at me and called me a monster and left me with people who could help me."

"That's horrible."  Stella sounded revolted by the thought.

I shrugged.  "Whatever."

"Have you talked to your mother since then?"  she asked.

"Twice.  Once when I was 18 when my father was introduced to me and the second time a few months later when she died."  My mother had been hunting a werebear and I was assigned the task to find it on my own and kill it.  It was part of my first hunt with my handler. My mother didn't want to give up the job so she came with us and insisted we do it her way.  So she was the first one in the werebear's cave and the first one attacked.  

She suffered massive injuries to her chest and I received a rake to the chest before I was able to kill it.  We rushed my mother to the Boulder Infirmary but she'd been bitten.  And the disease that makes a human a were creature tore my mother apart.  I watched her suffer through the window in the door because she refused my presence in her room.  I watched her die hating me.  

Stella tapped my arm.  "You did it again.  You okay?"

I nodded.  "Yeah, bad memories."

Stella squezed my arm, "I'm sorry for your loss."

I shrugged.  "I'm not."

"You can't hate your mother."

I nodded.  "I do.  She hated me.  Even in the end she hated me.  I watched her die from the other side of the door because she wouldn't let me in to her room."  I shook myself just as the seat belt light went on and we started our decent.  Just what I needed as we landed - more fucking anxiety.

## Best Friend

The landing made me sweat and my heart race as it always had, but Stella's warm hand on mine helped keep the worst of the panic attack away.  Thoughts of my mother were never good.  We waited until the plane was nearly empty before we got stood up and started gathering our things.  Aidan had passed out.  "I'll help you get to your car."

Stella smiled and nodded her thanks.  "Alright.  I appreciate it."

"No problem."  I said as we walked down the narrow passage of the airplane to the exit.  The catwalk made me just as nervous.  The long arm of steel and flooring suspended off the ground wasn't much better than an elevator if you asked me.  I took a deep breathe once we reached the terminal and I stopped at the first row of chairs and sat down for a moment to catch my breath and slow my heart rate.

Stella stood swaying next to me as she rocked Aidan's still sleeping form.  She asked, "You okay?"

I nodded and stood up.  "Yeah.  Better now.  Thanks."  I smiled at her and grabbed the stroller and unfolded it so Stella could drop the little one into it.  

He squawked a moment before he was passed out again with his little stuffed animal.  I couldn't quite make it out as Stella placed it in his arms.  It was yet another reminder of my first flight - holding on to my little stuffed Mushu and crying into his red plush fur trying not to upset my mother more.

I shook my hands and my body and we moved forward.  Stella didn't ask and I was grateful for not having to fully dredge up that memory.

We walked slowly through the cooridor of terminals in JFK's airport.  I had landed her often, but I remembered walking down the same path my first time.  Garrett houlding my hand and talking to me about what we were about to embark upon.  

I fought back the bile that started to rise in my stomach at the thought of my tormentor.  I hated him more than I hated my mother.  And for good reason.  But I shook the memories off as we reached the baggage claim area.  I expected to see Jace standing there with some stupid sign like he always did but he wasn't anywhere to be seen.  I pulled my phone out of my pocket and checked the time.  We were late - which means Jace got busy or forgot.  I would lay my bet on forgot.  It wouldn't be the first time.

Items had already started rolling around the carosel and Stella was pulling at her bags as they passed.  I stepped up beside her and helped her get the heavy bag off the belt and on to the floor next to Stella.  "What do you have in there?" I asked.  It wasn't overly heavy for me, but it was bulky and not really what I'd have brought with a child in tow, but it was the only bag other than her carryons so it was full utility it seemed.

Stella shook her head, "You've never traveled with a kid before."

I grinned.  "Can't say that I have."  My things made their way around.  One backpack filled with camping gear, the pots and pan I used out in the field were tie wrapped to their holsters for safe keeping, and my duffle full of my entire wardrobe and my life at current.  If it didn't fit in either, or my carryon backpack I didn't need it.  Was as simple as that.  My gun and survival knife were stored in a lock box in the camping bag and I had permits that said I could carry then on the plane in proper storage.  I hadn't gotten any complaints when I declared them.  I was a liscensed private invesigator among other things in order to get when I needed done - as were all hunters.  The human world was always getting in the way of things.

Stella giggled.  "Regular old grizzly adams."  She reached up and the beard on my chin.  "Though your beard could use some work."

I rolled my eyes.  "I like it like this."

Stella blushed, "So do I."  She started walking towards the car rental stands and I followed behind her pushing Aidan while she carried the suit case.  He had grabbed it on purpose.  

I stood back and waited for Stella to finish up with her rental and I looked around for any sign that my best friend would show up.  I didn't see him.  I pulled out my phone and dialed his number.  The phone rang for half a ring before I heard, "Fuck! I'm sorry."

I laughed.  "You forgot - again?"

"Yeah man.  Sorry.  I'll be there in an hour can you hold tight."  Jace sounded rushed and I knew he'd not be here in an hour.

"Nah.  I'll just take a cab."  

Stella stood next to me. "No you won't.  I'll drop you off anywhere you want.  It's the least I can do."

I smiled at her then I heard Jace, "Did you pick up a girl?"

I laughed.  "Not so much as picked up as she helped me through the flight."

I heard Jace groan on the other side.  "Dude, you better pay her back real well."

I smiled.  "I think we are even man.  I'll call you later, let you know the plan."

"Alright dude, but Mia expects you at the house tonight."

I nodded.  "I know.  I'm looking forward to it.  Can't wait to see Naya and JJ.  And Mia.  You I'm mad at."

Jace barked a laugh.  "Fair enough.  I'm sorry man. Really.  We'll be leaving her around 5pm so call before then."

"Alright, Jace.  Love ya babe."

"Love ya too.  See ya soon."  Jace hung up the phone and Stella was looking away.

"Babe? Your boyfriend?" She asked.  She looked a little down

I shook my head.  "My best friend.  Just a term of endearmant we toss around.  Use to be to make people uncomfortable, now it's just habit."

"And you love him?" Stella seemed a little taken back by my exchange of words.

"He's like a brother to me.  Yeah. I love him."  

"Oh."  Stella stammered without really wanting to say what she wanted, I could hear it in her voice.

"Now you are questioning things?  About me?  And Jace?"  I leaned down and whispered in Stella's ear.  "I like men, yes. But I also like women."

"Oh."  Her voice rose up in a cresendo and I knew I had taken her off guard by telling her what she had been wondering.

I grabbed the baggage handle before Stella could and hoisted my dubble on my shoulder and said, "Lead the way."

Stella sighed. "Alright."  I followed the short little red head to the SUV they had rented for her.  It was a safe enough model.

She packed her things in first then I set mine in behind her minus the bag I'd brought on the plane with me.  Stella handed me Aidan as she finished putting the stroller in then moved to the passenger side rear seat and started strapping in the car seat.  I watched as she worked.  She'd done this many times from the look of it.  It made me wonder what kinda guy doesn't step up to a girl like this.  I urked me a bit.

Aidan was groggy in my arms and laying his head against the crock of my neck and humming to himself as I rubbed his back when Stella turned around with a smile.  "I've never seen him take to anyone like you."

I grinned.  "I told you it's the relative age distance."

She strapped Aidan in and I climb into the passenger side.  I had no problems letting a woman drive.  As long as I wasn't driving in New York City I was happy.## Hotel Penn

We chatted on the short route to the LIE and on our way into the city.  I asked, "Where did they put you up?"

Stella nodded towards the GPS display on the dash.  "Hotel Pennsylvania."

I whistled.  "Posh.  Your ex must have some pull."

Stella shrugged.  "I dunno.  Why is it fancy?"

I nodded.  "Yeah, fancy is a word for it."

"How far is it from the building?"  Stella asked.

"About a 15 minute walk.  You can catch a train and make it in half that.  But really no point in it."

"So I really don't have to drive too far to drop you off." Stella seemed surprised.

"You can take me to the hotel.  I'll walk from there."  I would enjoy the walk.  I hadn't walked in my home town in many years.

"No.  I can drop you off, it'll let me see the building."

"I'd rather walk."  I insisted.  "Walking is good, it'll give me time to think."

"You need time to think?"  Stella asked.

"Always.  It's Sunday and I have a big presentation tomorrow.  I will miss my weekly check-in with my therapist and that's going to throw a whole new kink into the works." 

"Your therapist?"  Stella giggled.  "Your dad trying to straight you out?"

I shook my head.  "No, ma'am.  I've been in therapy since I was six.  The drama with my mother was only worsed by a year of ... well not so good treatment.  There was an accident and to insure it was really an accident they had me in pschye eval for a while.  I've continued the sessions because the PTSD and the OCPD never really went away.  I cope and manage everyday."

"Sounds rough.  Any other acryonyms you want to toss out there?"

I laughed.  "None that need to be said."

She grinned at me.  "So you have someone back home?"

I turned to look at the little red head driving.  "Are you asking me if I have a girlfriend?"

Stella blushed answering my question without answering.

"No.  Nor do I have a boyfriend.  I don't do relationships.  But for the record, this is home.  There is work."

Stella frowned.  "What are you a monk?  'I don't do relationships.'"  She laughed but it wasn't an I find you humorous laugh it was nervous and worried.

I leaned back in my chair.  "No, not a monk or celabate.  I've had plenty of sexual partners since I was 13 years old.  Just no relationships."

"That sounds lonely."  Stella sounded sad.

"Maybe.  But no one can hurt you if you don't let them in."  I said as I stared off into the distance watching the city draw near.

"That sounds really lonely."

I shrugged and we rode the rest of the way in silence.

Stella pulled up into the parking garage nearest the hotel and parked her rental car and got out and started to pull out our things from the back.  I got out slowly.  I had not intended to sleep with her, but now that I was fairly certain that particular card was off the table I was wanting to persuade her to let me into her bed.

I heard a squawk from the back seat and opened the rear door I had just passed and unbelted Aidan and shifted him to my hip and he clung to me like he was used to doing it.  His head was leaned against my shoulder and his little hand played little circles on my shoulder blade.  

Stella looked up and smiled shaking her head.  I asked, "What?"

Stella handed me my duffle bag and gear bag and took her son fro me.  "Nothing.  You look good with kids."

I grinned at her.  "Thanks."  But the reminder that she had a son had tempered my prior emotions.  I was okay with that which was odd.  "I'll help you inside if that's alright?"

Stella nodded.  "I'd like that.  I think Aidan would too."

We walked to the hotel which was across the street and down the block.  Stella hadn't wanted to use valet, something about not feeling right.  We got to the door of the hotel and the door man kindly opened it up and I followed Stella inside to the desk.  A bell hop brought a cart over and I set Stella's things on it and he stood there waiting for room number and information.  

The woman at the desk was a pretty blonde and I smiled at her as I stood behind Stella waiting for her to get through.  She turned and handed me a squirming Aidan, "Can you hold him while I do this.  He's being a worm."

"Sure." It wasn't like I had a choice in the matter she'd pretty much thrust him in my arms to begin with.  I tickled the little man in my arms and he giggled and squrimed until his mother returned pulling him gently from my arms.  

Stella looked at the bellhop and handed him a ten and said, "503."  He nodded and started for the elevator.  Stella looked at me with a grin.  "Do you want to come up?"

I looked at my phone for the time and decided that I did have time.  But I said, "I really shouldn't."  What the fuck was I doing, turning down this girl.

She smiled at me.  "Please?  You can tell me more about Apex Unlimited and we can order in while Aidan takes a nap.  I could use the company."

I looked at my phone again hoping that I could find some way out of it but there was nothing.  "Alright, I have time before Jace leaves.  I'll have him pick me up here."

We approached the elevator and I had to swallow hard as I stepped into the small cramped space with the bellhop cart, and two other adults inside.  I closed my eyes and clutched the metal rail.  Stella placed her warm hand on top of mine, "Don't like elevators either?"

I shrugged.  "I don't like heights at all."

I could feel the small woman step closer to me and pressed her leg against mine and Aidan climbed into my arms.  I had no other choice but to wrap my arm around him and around Stella's shoulder.  She settled against me with ease and I could feel the all to familiar tightness increase.  I thought to myself _I don't do relationships that's what she wants._

By the time the elevator stopped my heart was racing for more than one reason.  I was the last one off the elevator I followed Stella and the bellhop to her room and I was ready to leave.  I had to leave before she got the wrong impression.

Stella opened the door and the bellhop took our things into her room.  I took a deep breath and stepped inside.  The room was lavious and smelled clean.  I found no hints of any other odors not even the scent of cleaning fluid.  It was perfect.

I looked around while Stella unpacked.  I set Aidan down and he squawked and bounced with his hands in the air.  "Up," he demanded.

I lifted the little boy back up and moved to sit down on the couch.  He slayed himself on top of me and was soon snoring softly against my shoulder.

Stella smiled as she came and gently lifted him from me and took him to the play pen she'd set up.  I noticed a small patch of drool on my shirt.  It wasn't the first time, and it wasn't likely the last but without Aidan to create a buffer I was feeling axious.  And I don't get anxious around girls - even pretty ones.

Stella sat down next to me and I pulled my phone out I had to call Jace or I'd forget.  He picked up the phone quickly.  "Already?  Damn you are fast."

I laughed.  "Can you pick me up at Hotel Penn on your way home?"

I pulled the phone away from my ear and glanced at the time.  I still had time.  My hearts started to race faster.  Fuck.  

Jace answered.  I'd missed part of it, but I got the part I needed.  "I'll be there at 5pm sharp.  Don't be late."

"I'll be the one outside with my leg showing."

Stella giggled.  

Jace laughed.  "Don't do anything I wouldn't do."

"Bye Jace."

We hung up and Stella reached down and pulled my pant leg up.  She sighed.  "I thought you might have shaved."

I rolled my eyes.  She ran her fingers under my eyes, "I mean you do wear make up and all."

Again I rolled my eyes.  She had manuevered herself to her knees and was too close.  And the look in her eyes said more than words every could.  And I had enjoyed her touching me.  All day she had been touching me and I had enjoyed her soft rose scent and her warm touch.  I missed the touch of others.  I had been out in the field too long alone.

A small sigh escaped as her fingers played with a fringe of dyed-red hair over my left eye.  She was flirting and she knew the reaction she was getting from me.  I said in a low husky voice filled with the lust I was feeling, "I don't do relationships."

She whispered, "I know," in my ear.  I could feal her silky breath on my skin.

"You aren't typically my type."

She pulled back and slapped me upside the head, "And what type is that?"

I sighed.  Fucked that up again.  "A single mother.  A mom with a toddler to look out for."

I stood up and took a step back from the couch.  "Stella, I have rules.  I don't sleep with married individuals.  I don't sleep with anyone who may want more out of me than just sex.  I don't do relationships."

Stella stood up and stepped closer to me and looked up.  "You sure know how to kill the mood.  What if I just wanted sex?"

I smiled down at her and took another step back.  "I'd have to ask you why?"

Her face turned red.  "I need a reason to want sex?"  She was angry now.

"Well.  No."  She advanced on me and I took a step back for every step she took towards me until her hands balled up in a fist and my back hit the wall.  Fuck.  A gear in my head slipped and I could feel the panic and the fear rising up.  I tried to explain myself but nothing coherent came out of my mouth.  "I...Um.."

Stella stood inches from me with her fists balled up and staring up at me with fury.  "Spit it out."

As commanded I spoke cleanly and clearly in the voice I hadn't heard in a long time.  "You don't need a reason, but I wouldn't think a parent like you would want a casual relationship around your son.  One based on sex and sex alone.  As a single parent I'd hope your priority was your son."

The anger rose in her and then as she looked at me pressed against the wall in fear she frowned and stepped back.  I felt a little lighter but the panic still coursed through my veins.  The fear was riding my mind and I was truly afraid of the little red head in front of me.  She cocked her head at me and sighed as she sat back down. "You really are messed up aren't you?"

I stayed pressed agains the wall only relaxing enough to shake my hands out.  "You have no idea."

Stella sat on the couch and wrung her hands in front of her.  "I'm sorry."  Her voice had cooled dramatically the prickling against my skin lessened and relaxed a little.  "Aidan liked you.  I liked you."  She turned a shade of crimson just slightly lighter than her hair.  "I figured if you were a player at least I could feel..."  She stammered.  "I've not been with anyone since Aidan's father left me."

I didn't know what to say.  So I apologized.  "I'm sorry."  I sighed.  "It's not that I don't want to.  God, I want to.  But you have a son." I took a step from the wall and then another until I was standing behind the couch Stella was sitting in.  "I don't want you to find what you are looking for in me.  I'm not the kinda guy who's going to stick around.  You need that guy.  Not me."

Stella continued to look at the floor.  I took a deep breath and bent over Stella's small form then kissed the top of her head.  I could smell the sweet scent of roses and I could feel that small tightening in my body again.  I whispered against everything my body was telling me.  "I'm going to go now."  

I took a card out of my wallet and set it on the table near the door.  "Call me after your interview, let me know how it went.  If you move here maybe I can show you around.  Have a play date with Aidan."  I grinned at her.

Stella looked up at me with tears in her eyes.  Fuck!  I hated crying, I was weak when girls cried.  But she smiled at me.  "I'd like that.  See ya round Nox."

"See ya round, Stella."  I opened the door and hefted my things to my shoulder and I headed for the nearest stair well.  It was no where near time for Jace to pick me up.  I'd tell him I was stopping back at HQ and find my new room to stop by there.  But first I had to get as far away from the prickling fear that was chasing me down the stairs.
## Proposition

I dropped my gear off in my crap room.  It was a simple studio apartment layout with a small kitchenette, with two person table, a tv on the wall and a queen sized bed.  Everything in the room was beige - the most boring color in the world.  I had called Jace and he said he'd meet me here.  He wanted to know what happened, but I didn't want to talk about it. 

There was a knock on the door and I quickly answered it with my duffle bag and carry on from the plane in my hand.  It wasn't Jace.  It was a pretty little brunette with little red gem in the center of her head - one of our Indian natives it appeared.  Like humans the Venatori tended to pick up nationalities and heritages akin to the humans.  There was only one Indian family that I knew of which meant that this little fox was a Dowager.

"How can I help you Ms. Dowager?"  I asked.

"Oh, you know who I am?" she asked.

I shook my head.  "No, ma'am, just a guess."

"Oh.  Well I was told you were coming to town.  I have a proposal for you.  If we can talk in private."  

She was very confident I would say yes so I stood in the door way and said, "I've been back a few hours and already getting hit up with offers of breeding?"

She blushed.  "I'm sorry, but I wanted to be the first."

I sighed then stepped aside.  Come on in."

I dropped my bags at the door as she sat down at the table delicately.  I searched in my cupboards for glasses and found two and poured two glasses of ice water from the fridge and set one down in front of Ms. Dowager.  "I'd offer you something else but I just got in."

"Where you going somewhere?"  she asked nodding to my things.

"To my best friends place for a home cooked meal and some family time."  There was no reason to lie to her.

"I won't keep you long." she said.

I sat down across from her and leaned back against the back and waited for her to continue but she sat and watched me sipping at her water. "Your proposal?"

She nodded.  "I was just examining your features."

"Like cattle.  Thanks."  The sarcasm dripped like honey from my mouth.  I hated being treated like I was nothing more than breeding stock.

"Apologies.  I didn't mean to offend you."  She seemed sincere.  "I'm here to offer you my daughter."

"And what does she think on the matter?"  I asked. I wasn't exactly thrilled with pre-arranged marriages much less pre-arranged sexual partners.

"She asked me to speak to you on her behalf.  She just graduated from the Academy.  Your name has been floating about Academia and the Scrin.  And we beleive your line would be a great addition to our own."

"You do realize I am half human?"

She nodded.  "We are aware.  We have taken that into consideration.  The pure bloodline isn't a determinantal factor in this case.  You are Cesari.  The probability of Magnus is far greater than the small loss of potential ability.  You do not have Venatori speed, strength or agility if I'm to understand correctly.  But you possess our keen senses and from Ms. Rivera's report our senses are sometimes keener than our own.  You have an exceptional healing ability as we do despite being half human.  The lost abilities aren't a concern for a Scrin."    She was highly informed about me.

"And what do I get out of this?"  These things usually benefited all parties.

"Well.  An improved status.  A child to raise without interference with one exception."

"You mean your daughter doesn't want to raise her own child?"  I was shocked.

"You are correct.  Anabel doesn't wish to be a mother, but she wishes to remove her obligation to the Venatori as quickly as possible."  She sighed.  "We only want the child to be Scrin."

"I won't force my children one way or the other.  I can guide them in a particular direction but it is their choice not mine."

She sighed.  "The first child would be ours.   The second your line.  Both raised by you, two years apart."

"I see you have this all figured out.  What makes you think I want to raise children?"  I wanted to know why they thought this was compensation for my genes.

She smiled at me.  "I am aware of your issues with children raised by the community.  I don't expect you would let your children be raised by us as anymore than your father would."

"You know my father?"

"Of course.  Kai Viddens is a good friend."

"The two of you put this together then?"  I knew my father would interfer with my life.

She shook her head.  "No.  We did discuss you but I only did so because it was what my grandmother wanted.  Tradition between families."

"How long do I have to think about this?"

Ms. Dowager stood up and pulled a card from her small glittery handbag.  "You can call me anytime with your answer.  It is a good proposition, Master Sétanta."

I nodded and took the card.  "It is but I want to do my due dillenge as you have apparently done yours."

"Fair enough."  She headed for the door and smiled.  "A true Scrin.  You would definitely find a home among us if you so choose to chase the knowledge."

I laughed.   "I don't think I would be a very good scholar."  I walked her to the door and kissed her hand good-bye.  "It was a pleasure, Ms. Dowager.  I will be in touch."

Down the hall I heard a throat clear and I turned to see Mia Hill standing there in her pixie cut brown hair and a pair of holey jeans.  I laughed.  "Can't you find pants without holes?  I'll have to speak with Jace about upping your allowance."

Mia hugged me then stepped inside my room grabbed my bag and I picked up my duffle and shut my door behind me.  "I missed you Nox."

"I missed you too Mia.  Can't wait to have you cook for me."

Mia grinned back at me.  "Ditto.  I got dinner, you get breakfast."

I nodded.  "Sounds like a deal".## Family Time

Mia took the elevator and I went with her in the plate glass elevator.  She wasn't even tall enough that I could easily hide my fears against her body like I did with her husband.  But she wrapped her arm around my waist and leaned her body against mine - a comforting support hug.  I adored Mia.  She took care of me better than Jace did.  I was more than happy when Jace finally popped the question.

We'd known Mia for years upon years.  She was a year younger than us in the Academy and she ran in the same circle as us outside in the human world.  She like me was raised by the community.  Her parents were from way out west - Hawaii and couldn't live in New York as they ran the island's Venatori contingent.  And who wants to give up their post when your daughter becomes Magnus.  She didn't spark, but the ability came young and she's been her two years less than Jace and I.

She used to hate me.  Which meant she hated Jace.  That was until we ran into her in the same forbidden circles of the human world doing things her parents wouldn't be proud of.  We struck up a friendship and she of all things asked Jace out.  I was never jealous - Mia was never more than a friend to me.  Though we had shared a few moments of pleausre together though the circumstances were not something that we discussed at all.  

Mia squeezed my waist and brought me back to the real world.  "What you thinking about?"

I grinned.  "You and Jace.  How we met."

"Ah.  No wonder the litle drool coming out of your mouth."  I heard the humor in her voice but I had already reached up and wiped the non-existant drool from my mouth.  "Got you. Next floor we get off on.  We can take the stairs after that."

"Okay."  I straighted up and wrapped an arm around Mia's shoulders as she still clung to my waist for comfort.  "Jace is a lucky man."

Mia laughed.  "He is.  Isn't he?  Got me for a wife and you for a best friend.  Can't ask for anything better."

"I was talking about you, but yeah I guess he's got it made now.  Two perfect children, a loving wife, a best friend who's like his brother and house out in the suburbs."

"You sound almost jealous, Nox."  Mia pulled away and took a step back as the bell dinged open on our floor.

We walked down the Academy's lowest level where the day care facilities are and headed for Naya's class first.  I managed to say.  "I am, actually," just as Naya burst out of her class room with the other kids.  She skidded to a hault when she saw me standing there and walked casually up to her mother and gave her a hug.

"Hi Mom."  Mia nodded with a whisper, "Go ahead."

She didn't walk to me - she ran the few steps it took to get to me and jumped into my arms.  "Uncle Nox."

"Hey babe."  She wrapped her arms around my neck and squeezed tight.  I shifted her so she wouldn't be knocking my duffle bag into me the whole time and she settled into me like an old rag doll as we went to go get JJ.  

The toddler aged children were another cooridor over and JJ was happily playing with his friends until his mother gave a little whistle and his ears perked up.  His head lifted over the half wall separating the toys from the classroom and he hurriedly put his toys away when he saw me holding his sister.  If there was anything that boy hated it was sharing hugs with me.  

JJ didn't even bother with a Hi Mom as Naya had. He walked straight up to me.  He punched me in the thigh and Mia scolded him.  "We do not hit Jason Hill Junior.  You know this, even if it is Uncle Nox and he deserves it."

She winked up at me.  "Now because of that you don't get to see him until we get home."

I leaned my head back fighting the urge to say something but this was her son.  And I had no say in the matter.  She was right - no hitting, but I didn't even get a hug from the little man.

JJ startd crying as Mia hoisted him up on her hip with my backpack and we started walking towards the stairs.  "We can take the elevator, Mia.  It'll be easier."

Mia sighed with relief, I could see it written all over her face.  JJ was not making it easy.  Once in the elevator Mia had a private conversation with JJ in the corner.  I leaned against the wooden rail and buried my face in Naya's hair.  It smelled like lavendar which I knew both the younger the Hill's hair did.  It was something Mia did to calm them in their evening baths.  It was a calming scent though not enough to completely remove the anxiety from the elevator.  

Naya whispered in my ear.  "I got you, Uncle Nox.  Nothing to be afraid of."

I grinned across at her.  "Thanks babe."

Another group of parents got in the elevatore a floor down.  A small voice spoke up to us.  "Hi Naya."

Naya scrambled down from my embrace and stood a little under that little girl.  "Hi Cat."  Naya looked nervous.  

The little girl asked Naya, "Is this the boyfriend you are always talking about?"

I raised my eyebrow and Naya blushed.  But she didn't confirm nor deny the fact.  Not good.  What had she been saying?  I looked to Mia and she mouthed, "This is your fault."

I sighed and nodded.  It was.  I flirted with Naya as I flirted with everyone else.  Mia and Jace hadn't said anything when she was younger and once she got older it was difficult to stop.  I would fix this though.

The little girl continued to bully Naya.  "Isn't he a little old for you, what's he like 20?"

Twenty was old?  Damn, kids these days.  Naya was about to say something when I put my hand on her shoulder.  I knelt down and was eye level with both the girls.  "I'm twenty -nine thank you very much.  And I'm not Naya's boyfriend.  I'm her uncle."  I waved my hand in front of the girls and a small ball of fire winked into existance.  The little girl paled.

Naya spoke, "I told you he was good."  She sounded more cocky than I did.  Naya waved her hand like I had and a smaller version of the fireball winked into existance above her palm.  "I have the best tutor in the world."

The little girl stammered and sputtered.  "Mine is better."

Naya laughed.  "Highly doubtful.  Is he Cesari too?"

I stood up and let the fireball wink out as I covered her hand and extinguished Naya's too.  "Okay that's enough.  I am not some thing you brag about Naya."

I looked across at the other parent.  The little girl giggled, "That's my Nanny. She won't say anything to me."

I grinned.  "Please turn around ma'am."  The woman grinned and did as I asked.

I didn't touch the little girl but I flared my power around me and she felt the soffocating pressence.  "You bother Naya again and you will have to deal with me."

The little girl's eyes were wide with fear.  I could smell the aweful stench on her.  On everyone in the elevator.  The elevator dinged on the bottom floor and I pushed Naya ahead of me out the door - Mia followed.

It took me a few moments to reign in my presense.  It was a trick I'd learned so I didn't stand out.  Most Magnus didn't have that control.  But when control is beaten into you as a child you tend to remember such lessens.

Mia took a deep breath.  "Jesus, Nox."

"I'm sorry."  I really was I hadn't meant to scare them too.

JJ giggled, "That was awesome."

I gave him a half grin while we waited for Jace in front of the statue they had nicknamed Atlas.  I had created it when I was 10 - proving to the world that I was Cesari.

Naya asked, "Did you really make this, Uncle Nox?"

Mia nodded, "He sure did.  It was one of his greatest acheivements."

I smiled at Mia.  It wasn't an acheivement I was doing what I was told - art.  I didn't know that what I had done was near impossible - working all four elements at the same time.  Everything but the ants and the grass seeds I had created from nothing.  The large globe above his head was it's own little world.  I had applied our life cycle science to the globe - the greenhouse effect to make a completely isolated world inside the globe.  It sustained itself year round without any interference and it had for the past 19 years.

Jace came up and stopped before me and frowned, "Why do you feel so much more powerful right now?"  He looked at me with a disapproving glare, "What did you do?"

Naya stepped between me and her father with her hands on her hips.  "He was standing up for me."

"Cat?"

She nodded.  "She was picking on me about Uncle Nox."

I sighed.  "Which you need to stop calling me your boyfriend Naya."  I turned her around and knelt down.  "I love you.  You know this.  But you are my family.  That is what I am."

She looked hurt and I didn't blame her I had no tact.  Jace put his hand on his daughters shoulder, "You'll learn to live with it."

My heart sank.  He knew all too well the feeling of loving me without my feelings returned in the same way.  When we were younger Jace had wanted more.  More than just the friendship we had shared.  More than the shared experiences.  More than I could give him.  He was my brother, my family.  My only connection to the world that made life worth living.  He eventually understood why I couldn't be more.

Mia put her hand on my waist and guided me towards their car.  She walked slower than the others, Jace had taken JJ and my bag from her and was walking at a rather fast pace with Naya chattering away at him about what I'd done.  Mia spoke softly, "He understands yu know?"

I nodded.  "I know, but it doesn't hurt any less for either of us."

Mia sighed, "If you'd been with him, Nox.  He wouldn't be with me - not ever."

"I know that too.  You are one reason.  I'm the main one though."  I sighed.  "I do love him.  And it's not that I'm not attracted to him."

"He knows.  You come up often after you've been gone a long time.  And not during sex or afterwards.  Just randomly he'll curl up against his pillow away from me.  And when I ask him what's wrong - he just misses you.  Misses having you around.  You are staying for a while right?"  Mia sounded concerned, "He really needs you."

I nodded.  "That's the plan."  I stopped and turned towards Mia.  "I want to start my own family.  I want what ya'll have."

Mia's face lit up like a beacon.  "That's wonderful Nox."  And it fell nearly as fast.  "That means you have to let someone in."

"Yeah.  I'm thinking kids will be easier.  I've already been propositioned once and I'm assuming there will be more who want a possible Cesari in their bloodline."  I truly hated the world I lived in sometimes.  But it is what it is.

"Wow.  That was fast.  Who?"

"The Dowager line - Anabel's mother specifically came to me about her daughter."

"I know Anabel.  She's a sweet girl.  Heading off to nursing school like I did."

"I haven't given her an answer yet.  I want to do some digging."

Mia laughed.  "Of course you do."

We reached the car.  Naya and JJ were already inside.  But Naya was bouncing around the seat.  "I better get in before she hurts herself."

Mia nodded.  "They love having you here Nox."

"I know."  I got in and sat in the middle seat.  It was uncomfortable but I got to see both kids and they were more than happy to have me sitting there.  Which made it all that better.

Jace drove home and the adults up front held their own private conversation while I chatted with the kids.  I found out JJ was being a bully so we had a deep discussion about what being a better person meant.  I don't think he got it.  But I think he at least understood some of what I said to him.

Naya on the other hand was the one being bullied and I showed her how to do what I'd done.  To be threatening without actually threatening.  Her power was still new to her, but she was learning quickly.  Jace looked at me and gave me a frown in the rear view mirror.  I was teaching his children things he'd rather not have them know.  But what was done was done.  You don't unforget knowledge quite so easily.

The kids ran inside carrying my bags and Mia followed them inside.  "Dinner will be ready in an hour, you two."

We both nodded, "Yes ma'am" I said and Jace shook his head.

"You really shouldn't teach my kids that stuff."  Jace sighed, "JJ's already doing things we think he saw from you."

"Like what?"

"Viels in particular."  Jace said.  "He's always hiding things so we can't find them."

"On purpose?"  I asked.

"He says no, but..."  Jace trailed off rubbing the stubble at his chin.

I grinned at him.  "I can help with that.  I doubt he knows what he's doing.  It's an easy trick to learn and to not know you are doing it.  I did."

Jace nodded.  "You didn't specifically show him did you?"

I shook my head.  "Not on purpose anyway." I removed my personal veil I usually kept up and Jace nodded.  "Something I do out of habit."

Jace sighed, "I don't know why you just don't get those scars taken care of."

"That would make people ask questions.  Questions I don't want to answer."

Jace shook his head.  "I don't know why not.  Everyone who's seen them would love to know the truth."

"Noone would beleive me anyway."  I headed for the door.  "I'm going for a swim."

"It's like 50 out."  Jace called after me shutting the cargo door in the SUV.

"I can fix that, remember?"

I went for a swim and the kids splashed around in the pool with me.  Dinner was roasted chicken covered in herbs and a decadant lemon sauce with mashed sweet potatoes and a healthy serving of wild rice.  One of my favorite dishes Mia knew how to cook.  We chatted through dinner - school projects, me being home indefinately.  Mia offered me a place on her couch whenever I wanted.

The kids were sent to their rooms for homework and lessons and I went for a run. 

By the time I got back the kids were in bed and Mia and Jace were settling in themselves.  I took a shower then laid down on the couch.  I had an early morning.  I wasn't looking forward to getting up in front of smart people to talk about my theories.  Theories I could only bet the would laugh at.## Morning Ritual

My night started as any other - darkness.  The darkness filled with a red eire glow as my demons approcahed in the depths of my mind.  I could feel the tension rising.  I felt the air around me thicken as I was pushed against the wall that had not been there before.  

A flicker of light like lightning outside a window but no thunder followed changed the scene.  The darkness was replaced with billowing smoke that made it hard to breathe.  Shadows moved in the smoke but I couldn't make anything out yet - but I knew what they were. 
Tentacles of earth, air, fire and water slipped and slide over the surface of the earth as the red glow formed into a set of eyes glowing in the smoke.  I would never fully see the figure that tormented my dreams though I knew who it was.  I have always known.  

One tentacle of air reached me and I flinched in the glow of it's aura.  I could see the pattern that made it whole and I froze on instinct.  It slashed at my shirt and it fell to the ground in shreads.  The bile and the fear rose in my stomach I wasn't sure what was worse the nausea or the fear - both a product of my anxiety and nightmares.  My heart raced inside my chest.  It felts like it was trying to escape.  I wish I could escape.

A voice echoed in my head.  "There is no escape."

There were tentacles all around me and when the first lashed out I felt my skin flay.  The second and the third went deeper and I felt my skin knitting back together but the onslaught of the demon's tentacles left my back a bloody mess.  The glowing eyes moved closer, and with all the elements at once one final strick broke my silence and I bit back my scream falling.  I never fell...

I landed on the floor between the coffee table and the couch I had made my bed.  My back ached and my lip felt swollen.  I rolled on to my back and I could feel the wounds healing even know.  I touched my lip with one hand and pulled away blood, but the ache was slowly disappearing from there as my body healed itself.  

My back was a bloody mess.  Which meant that couch and floor would now carry stains of my blood.  Fuck!  How was I going to explain this to Mia.

A groggy figure stood above me and I frowned.  Mia asked, "You okay?"

I shook my head.  "Nightmares."

Mia frowned.  "I heard."  A small ball of illumenscent light formed over Mia's hand as she looked at the couch.  "That'll come out.  Let me see."

I didn't move but Mia stepped around the coffee table and knelt down before me and lifted my shirt.  "It's mostly healed now.  Nox, what's going on?"

I shrugged.  "I'm home."

Mia grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me around violently.  I fell backwards trying to scramble away.  Mia lifted her hands away from me.  "I'm sorry.  Talk to me."

"The first night home is always the worst."  I said in a small voice which made me think of the first time it had happened.  I was so scared, in so much pain as my body healed itself from self inflicted wounds.  

"What's going on?"  Mia whispered as she started crawling towards me.  I didn't move, she wasn't adding to the terror coursing through my veins.  She wrapped her arms around me and held me tight.  I collapsed into her embrace like a small child.  Mia was careful not to touch my back.

"Don't worry about it.  I'll talk with Margo soon."

"Come to bed, Nox.  We'll keep you safe."  Mia stood up and offered me a hand.  I turned and took it without thinking.  It had been a long time since I'd shared their bed and even longer in a platonic fashion.

Mia lead me by the hand to her bedroom and opened the door quietly and we slipped inside.  Jace was lying near the side of their king side bed.  Mia walked over and shoved him over he grumbled but he moved.  "What?" he said groggily.

"Nox had a nightmare."

Jace's eyes popped open and he move to the middle of the bed.  Mia crawled over him and laid down and drapped her head on his shoulder.  "I shouldn't"  I said.  "I will only wake up again."

Jace tossed the edge of the covers over and patted the bed next to him.  "We'll keep you safe, Nox.  Come on."

I sighed.  It was a lie, there was no safety in my dreams.  But the gester was nice.  I laid down next to Jace and stared up at the ceiling before Jace was tugging at me to join them.  I laid down next to him and felt the familiar warmth of his body against mine.  When were were kids he often slept in my bed.  It was like a comforting blanket I had forgotten.  Jace rolled on to his side away from me and I curled up against the length of his body and he Mia's.  My hand drapped over his hip and I felt Mia's underneath my hand.  I moved it aside but she grabbed it and pulled it over both of them.  She held my hand and I drifted off into the blackness again with ease.

The darkness wrapped itself around me.  A chaos of patterns bloomed in my vision.  Reds and greens shifted in swirls of Christmas vomit as the yellows and blue made horrid shades of green as they mixed and mingled.  Patterns became abstract like I was living in a world made by Picaso.  Fires started in every creavice of my mind.  Little children danced in bonnets and bayonets.  One flaying the other before there was nothing but puddles of blood sifting through the kalidescope of colors.

And then it was black again.  The shifting colors were there covered in darkness.  Things would bump against my extremedies.  The cool breeze blew against my skin and it felt plesant until it became ice cold and my skin froze in ribbons. 

The fires from before burned through the darkness until I saw nothing but the flickering flames and I felt their red hot heat through my dreams.  I could feel the sweat beading on my brow.  I wipes my hands across my forehead and they came back blood red.  I was too distracted by the red on my hands to notice the red eyes coming near and when I looked up I saw my nightmare face to face.  His eyes were no longer red and glowing but the amber brown I remember them to be.  He smiled down at me like days of old.  I tried to get away.  

I started awake as my shoulder fell.  My heart was racing.  And my shoulder ached from the fall to the floor but I didn't bother getting up.  Jace was looking over the edge, "You wouldn't wake up."

"Sorry." I stayed flat on the floor while Jace climbed to the other side of the bed and started getting ready.  I could hear his movements towards the shower without another word. 

Mia whispered, "Will he be alright?  Why don't you go help him?"

Jace gave her a quiet laugh.  "He doesn't want my help.  He never does.  Just leave him be, he'll get up once the panic has been righted.  Trust me, I know Nox."

Mia sighed, and in a raised voice meant for me, "You got breakfast still?"

I took a deep breath and sat up.  "Yeah I got it." 

I was up and moving out the door when Mia shook her head, "You might want to change your shirt first."

I took it off and turned it around it was covered in slashes of blood.  "I'm sorry about that."

She handed me one of Jaces from the nearby closet.  "No problem.  It wasn't your fault."

They at least beleived me to a degree.  What I would tell them anyway.  Neither of them were happy I never told them exactly what was going on.  But I couldn't bring myself to say it much less say it outloud.

I pulled the shirt over my head and went into Mia's kitchen.  If one thing was for sure Mia had a great kitchen.  She had a grill right in the middle of her stove top and I would have loved to cook a steak on it, but that wasn't on the menu for today.  The kids wanted pancakes, eggs and bacon when I was over.  They were still in bed right now.

I made breakfast from scratch - well I didn't cure the bacon or fetch the eggs, but the pancakes I made from scratch.  It was one of my own special recipes.  It was healthier than regular pancakes but don't tell the kids that or they'd have your head.

I started a pot of coffee which was a brand new unopened package of a high end coffee that I knew Mia and Jace only bought cause I was here.  It was one of the few things I splurged on even in the wilderness.  They had already ground it which was disapointing but the smell was awesome.  I couldn't wait to have a cup of it.

I started with the batter and got it all mixed up.  Mia had all the ingredients but then she had wanted me to cook too so I knew she would.  Jace and Mia's kitchen was set up perfectly - at least while I was around.  I had a habit of putting things in their places even if they weren't there before.  That was one of my annoying compulsions.  I didn't like disorganized things so I tended to fix them.  I wasn't a neat freak.  It wasn't dirt or dust that bothered me.  Just things out of place.  But I wasn't complex enough to have patterns or such in things.  Just order.  I was thankful my compulsions didn't push the OCD patterns.  No counting things that drop or washing my hands 100 times.  

I started the bacon in the oven on a rack and then started flipping pancakes.  The first few were messy as it had taken me a few tries to get my groove.  I hadn't made pancakes since I was here last and that was over a year ago.

I started hearing sounds coming from the hallway as the kids started to wake up and get ready for school.  At one point JJ was screaming and running down the hall butt naked.  I pointed at the hallway he'd come from and he sulked and turned around the other way and back into his bedroom to finish changing.  

Naya was sitting at the kitchen table watching me flip pancakes.  She was a spitting image of her mother.  Which was a good thing she didn't need to take after Jace.  But she was unlike anyone in her family - quiet and shy and completely reserved.  Not an ounce of showoff in her, which made me wonder what had gotten into her with the little girl in the elevator.  "Hey Naya."

She looked over at me as I started making the scrambled eggs in the frying pan.  "Yeah Uncle Nox?"

"Why did that girl bother you so much?"  I flipped another pancaked and Naya grinned as it landed with a soft splat.  

"She's always picking on me.  Says I'm ugly.  Says I'm stupid."

I sighed.  The last pancake was done and the eggs were starting nicely.  I beckoned her to me with a single finger and she came over and wrapped her arms around my waist and pressed her head into my stomach.  I patted her back.  "Naya."  I lifted her little chin and saw a small stream of tears.  "Oh Naya, baby.  You aren't ugly.  You are a beautiful little girl, just like your Mama.  And you aren't stupid.  And anyone who's calling you names is only jealous.  Baby, you are the greatest little girl I know."

I turned back towards the eggs careful of Naya's arms around me and finished the eggs.  I called down the hall, "Breakfast is on."

I looked down at Naya.  "Set the table please."

She skipped away, and I hoped that what I had said helped and didn't make the whole boyfriend thing worse.

Mia came out searching under things and in corners.  "Naya you seen JJ's shoes?"

She shook her head.  "No ma'am.  He hide them again?"

I started looking around and found a pecicular weave hiding behind the potted plant.  "Mia they are in the corner."

I called out, "Hey JJ.  Come here man."

He ran towards me in his stocking feet and tried to slide but the carpet in the livingroom didn't allow him to do that.  "Did you hide your shoes?"

He looked down at the floor and nodded his head.  "Why?"

"So I didn't have to go to school."

I lifted his chin to look at me as I knelt down.  "Are you using magic on purpose?"

"What?  No.  I don't know any magic.  Except the light you taught me."  JJ produced a no heat dim little light orb above his hand.  

"You sure that's all you know?"

He nodded emphatically.  "Okay I'm going to show you a veil.  But you can't used it to hide things.  If I find out you are doing it on purpose I will have your daddy take away everything in your room and you'll only have a bed to sleep in and clothes in your drawers and closet.  Okay?"

He nodded.  "Yes sir.  No hiding things with this veil."

"Particularly your school things.  Do you understand?"

He nodded again.  "Pinky swear."  He held out his pinky and we shook on it.

I crafted a hidden pattern that JJ could see.  He was a fast learner so I did it slowly and wrapped it around Mia's end lamp table.  It vanished from sight.  JJ's mouth fell open in an O and said, "Cool!"

I undid the pattern and it came back unharmed.  I could explain the mechanics behind it but a four year old wasn't going to understand the idea of bending light.

JJ tried the weave and managed to hide half the lamp and he giggled.  

"Looks like you can only do small things.  The weave will eventually wear off but you cannot do it to anything on purpose do you understand me.  And if they find your shoes under another veil after this remember nothing in your room."

"Even my night light."

I nodded.  "Even your night light."

He nodded as Mia sat him down on the couch and helped him tie his shoes.  She smiled at me.  "Thanks.  Hopefully that will help."

I nodded.  "Hopefully."

While their family ate I slipped in Jace and Mia's bathroom and grabbed a shower.  Mia came in while I was pulling on the pair of dress pants that I was going to wear.  "You weren't hungry."

"I'll eat small before I go.  Don't need to have too much in my stomach."  

I turned to the mirror and started applying the eyeliner under my eyes and Mia giggled.  "I knew you used eye liner."  She rummaged through my toiletry bag, "That's all."

"My lipstick is in the other bag."  I grinned and ran my fingers through my red tipped hair.  I probably should have dyed them back that out.  There was notime for that now.  

She laughed as Naya giggled behind her mom's leg.  "Uncle Nox do you really wear lipstick?"

"No ma'am.  Well I have.  But it's not a regular occassion.  And usually only when I really pushing the gay pride thing."

Mia smacked my arm.  "Nox.  She doesn't need to know that."

"Know what? that I like boys."

Naya giggled, "Mommy I know that already."

Mia shook her head.  "No, the gay pride thing - we don't diferentiate between sexual preferces."

I laughed.  "I wonder why."  I stuck my tongue out at Mia.

But it was Naya who commented.  "Because Daddy likes men too.  But he likes Mommy the most."

"He does at that."  I agreed.

Mia gave me that look that said I was wrong, but she didn't say anything with her daughter present.  It was really the only bad blood between us.  But it had only made us closer so not really bad blood.

I pulled on my dress shirt as Mia left and Naya stood in the doorway watching me.  "Uncle Nox, what are all those scars."

"Which ones?" I asked as I buttoned my shirt.  She came over and ran her fingers across my chest.  "Those are from a were bear that killed my mother.  He tried to kill me too."

"But he didn't.  I'm glad."

"Me too." I agreed.

I picked her up and sat her on the sink and started tying my tie.  She took it deftly in her hands and finished for me.  I watched her in the mirror and she did it perfectly.  I was impressed.  "Your dad let you do that for him?"

She laughed.  "Daddy can't tie a tie."

Jace must let her do it all the time because I know he can tie a tie, he has helped me on a number of occassions when my fingers were too shakey to be of use.

She wrapped her arms around me and rubbed my back.  The healing marks were still tender and I froze under her touch.  She smiled up at me.  "I'm sorry someone hurt you."

I grinned at her.  "It's alright hunny.  I'll survive.  I promise."  And I would.  It was everything I could do to survive my nightmares and fears and I would not let them beat me down.

But right now my biggest fear was two hours away and I hadn't even looked over my notes since the plane.
## Fear of Heights

Jace drove into New York and I sat in the back with the kids again.  They chattered at me and distracted me from the upcoming events that were making butterflies leap in my stomach.  I hadn't managed to grab anything to eat but Naya thought for me and picked up a few peices of bacon and pancakes for me.  She said the eggs were too messy for the car.  I nibbled at the pancakes and gave the kids the bacon to share between them.  

As we got out of the car they both gave me a hug with geasey finger tips and Jace had to hold my jacket while I got the smears off with air and water.  Mia laughed.  "Fancy dry cleaning."

I shrugged, it was nothing.  "You do what you have to in the field."

Jace laughed.  "How often did you need your suit cleaned and pressed in the field?"

I frowned.  "Funerals."

The humor drained away and they both knew I was specifically speaking about my mother's funeral, but there had been others.  Fellow hunters who had died in the area and I went to show their families support.  It was the least I could do when I was sent to clean up their mess.

We parked in lower parking garage and I hated it worse than most places in the AU building.  It reminded me of clinging in fear to the man who had started my nightmares.  It was not a happy place.

Jace and his family headed for the elevator as I hefted my bags on my shoulder.  They stood waiting for the elevator and I couldn't make myself do it right now.  My stomach was already doing flips and I was anxious about everything happening today I didn't need more.  "I'm going to take the stairs."

Jace nodded.  "I'll take your bags to your room so you can go straight there then.  Stop by the class if you can I want them to meet you."

I nodded and handed him my bags taking the folder of notes from my backpack.  "Thanks, man.  I'll try."

The elevator dinged and I watched as my only family went in and turned around and the little ones waved good-bye.  I hated leaving them even though I intended to stay here and they'd be in my life more now.  It still hurt watching them leave.

I headed for the stairs once the elevator doors closed.  I walked them casually to the lobby.  I wasn't in a hurry.  I had a little time.

I stopped in the lobby and sat down with a black coffee in front of the statue of Atlas and tried to focus on the words I needed to remember.  This was the biggest deal I'd ever done.  In the field I didn't have to give speeches.  And these people were way smarter than I was.  Who was I kidding?

A small sound made me look up and I saw Stella standing across the table from me.  "Fancy meeting you here."

I grinned up at her.  I tried not to flirt though, but it was hard.  "I told you I work here."

She nodded.  "I know, but it's a big place."  Stella pointed at the plaque on the statue, that says you made that."

I turned around though I knew she was pointing at Atlas and the little gold placque that they mounted to the base of the statue.  I shrugged.  "When I was a kid."

When I turned around Stella was staring at me, "What are you a virtuoso?"

I shook my head. "No."  I was Cesari.  But I couldn't exactly tell her that.

"It's beautiful.  Did you have help?"  She asked.

"No. It was an art project."

"You had to have help.  There is no way a kid could have made that.  It's so detailed."

I shrugged.  "You might understand later."

"What's that supposed to mean?"  She sounded offended.

I stood up and looked at the time on my phone.  I'd wasted too much time.  I held my hand out to invite Stella along as I headed for the elevator with my coffee and notes.  "If you are here for a job I think you are, then you'll come to understand."

"You know something about what I'm interviewing for?"

"Not specifically no.  I have a gut feeling and I trust my gut."  I grinned at her as I stood staring at her instead of the elevator door.  

The door dinged open and I waited for people to file out before stepping inside the plate glass death trap with Stella.  I caught a glimpse of her looking at me as I clamped my eyes shut.  Stella moved closer and took my hand in hers.  "I can see why you are afraid of elevators now."

"I've always been afraid of heights.  But this makes it worse."  I intoned in a soft whisper.  

We rose up in side the elevator and I could feel my fluttering increase.  We both got out at the top floor.  It was the main offices of the Infirmary and Venatori Headquaraters.  Stella smiled at me.  "I guess this is it.  Wish me luck."

"Good luck Stella.  You'll do great."  I kissed her cheek.

I could feel the anxiety rising as the conference area on the next floor up neared closer.  I took the elevator that was slightly more offset from the first one, it was behind a key carded turn stile but in reality it was a supernatural gate.  Technology and magic combined to freely let the supernatural pass through, humans required a key card.

I so wasn't ready for this.## Crushes

The elevator doors opened on the conference floor and there was a crowd milling about outside of the closed double doors.  My heart beat fast as I stepped on to the hard wood floors and I could hear the soft clicking of the souls of my fancy dress shoes on the floor.  It sounded like I had a tack stuck in the bottom.  

I stepped to the side and leaned against the wall and lifted the offending foot over my knee and saw the tiny metalic peice sticking out.  I rolled my eyes.  Glad I hadn't been barefoot when I stepped on it.  I had to use air and fire to get the peice out of the sole of my shoe.

I melted the small tack into a small ball of molten metal when someone cleared their throat to catch my attention.  I looked up with the small ball floating above my hand.  My face split into a wide grin.  I knew that face.  I hadn't seen it in many years.  He asked me, "Nox Sétanta?"

I nodded. "Yeah."

He breathed a sigh of relief through luscious lips.  I took a moment to remember the masculane features of the boy I remembered.  His mustashe and goatee were neatly groomed and kept at the perfect length.  He wore none of the makeup he had as a teenage - that was a surprise.  His hair was perfect.  I didn't know how he kept it so, even after he ran his fingers through it in fustration.  "Nox?"

I snapped out of my revelry and smiled.  "Sorry.  What did you say?"

He sighed and I could see the signs of anger flash across his face.  A small ripple of lines in his forehead and at the corners of his mouth.  I knew he didn't like to repeat himself - it had been one of the things that everyone in the Academy knew about Dorian Vega.  The quickest way to get under his skin was to make him repeat himself.  

"The presentation in front of you is running long.  Is that alright?"  Dorian repeated, the aggravation was clear in his voice.

I nodded. "Anything to prolong this."

Dorian smiled at the joke.  "You look nervous.  Come with me?"

I followed him through the crowd.  I had to break myself from watching him move.  He was graceful like a cat.  He didn't have the typical gay swagger of really out men.  He walked with the grace of a dancer like he knew what every muscle did and how to make it even more attractive.  He had always been the perfectionist.

We walked into an employee's only room and I was suprised to find it empty save for the couches and tables that made up this break room.  He turned to me, "Coffee?"

I held up my cup.  "I'm good, thanks."

He walked over to me and I could smell a soft scent of cinamon and vanilla coming off of him over the dark musk of his cologne.  I took a deep breath and closed my eyes and I let my self relax.  I sensed more than saw that he had offered me his hand, I took it it without opening my eyes and shook firmly.  He spoke softly, "I'm Dorian Vega - coordinator of this lovely event."  His hands were soft yet firm.  I didn't want to let go.

I nodded and opened my eyes and stared into his deep blue eyes.  "I know who you are.  I saved you once upon a time, a long time ago."  He slipped his fingers from mine trailing along my long fingers and I wonder if he had done that on purpose.

Dorian blushed and nodded.  "Yes.  I wasn't sure you'd remember me."

I grinned at him.  "One does not forget a goregous man landing on top of you."

The rose color rose higher along Dorian's neck it almost reached his ears.  He nervously looked away.  Awwww...

He took my folders from me and the paper cup my coffee had come in and set them on the end table nearby.  Then turned back to me.  "I never did get to properly thank you."  He straightened the shoulders of my jacket and adjusted my tie.  The feeling of his fingers against my shirt sent shivers up my spine.  I had had a crush on this man since before he'd been accidentally pushed over the edge of the roof and I dove over to save him.

"I'd like to get together over dinner, if that's alright to properly thank you for saving my life and talk about your theories."  Dorian sounded a littled awed at the last statement.

"Are you asking me on a date?"  I flirted.

Dorian never looked up from my tie that he was meticuoulsly straightening and retying.  "It's not..."  He paused and then looked up at me through lowered eyelids.  "Yes."

I grinned at him.  "I think we can manage that."

The door opened and Dae'lin stepped inside, "There you are."

I rolled my eyes as she turned me around and started straightening my tie again.  She pushed a lock of my hair that had fallen over my eyes and sighed at the red still tipping them.  "You still do this?"  

I rolled my eyes at her last statement and sighed, but ignored it altogether.  "Dorian just did that Dae'lin and I think he's better at it then you ."  I pushed her small hands from tie.  "So leave it be."

The small raven haired women who had been my mentor looked taken aback as she stared up at me from her 5 foot status.  I grinned down at her.  "Nice to see you too, Dae'lin."

She pushed me aside and looked to Dorian.  "How could you let that baffoon in there run over like this?"

I could feel the anger rolling off Dae'lin as she confronted Dorian but he kept his feelings in check.  "Dae'lin, your student here is fine with it.  He's not a child anymore.  You don't have to speak up for him.  He's more than capable of it himself."

"Yeah, Dae'lin.  What he said."  I grinned at them both.  I heard the doors open.  "Dae'lin, I think it's time.  Can you take my notes to the podium?"

She looked at me sideways.  "Are you trying to get rid of me?"

I nodded.  "Yes, ma'am."

She rolled her eyes and grabbed the folder of my notes and headed for the door.  "Don't keep them waiting too long, Nox."

"I won't," I reassured her.

I turned to look at Dorian.  "Sorry about that.  Can I call you later about those dinner plans?"

Dorian nodded.  "It doesn't have to be today.  I know you just got back in town."

I shrugged.  "Tonight's as good as any. I just don't know what little miss bossy pants has in scheduled for me after this."

"I don't have a card on me.  You can look me up in the directory."  Dorian suggested.

I pulled my phone out of my pocket and handed it to him.  "Call yourself."

He smiled at me and took my phone, his fingers brushing the back of my hand and I felt sparks ignite across my flesh.  I had to swallow hard or choke on the lust that had taken up residence in my system.  I watched as he called himself.  The phone in his pocket rang and then abruptly cut off.  He handed my phone back to me with a small smile, he was careful not to touch me again and I felt a stab of loss at the missed oppurtunity.

Dorian held his hand out and ushered me out the door to the stage entrance.  He turned me around and adjusted my tie one more time and dusted off my shoulders and smiled.  He ran one finger under the rogue colored lock of hair that had fallen back where I liked to reside over my right eye with a smile.  "I always did like it.  Good luck.  And just be yourself, you'll do great."

I'm glad he had more confidence in me than I had in myself.  I was still not ready for this.

## Being Myself

I took a deep breath and walked out on to the stage and stood behind the podium and then looked out over the crowd.  I saw Dae'lin standing near the closed double doors in the back and Dorian was walking down the aisle to th empty seat in the front row that said 'Reserved - Dorian Vega'.  His own personal front row seat.  I could see his small smile and a nod of his head as I watched him.  He was pushing me onward and upward.

I waited for him to sit down in his seat and I could feel a wave of grumbling start from the audience.  I closed my eyes and then opened the with a deep breath and started.  "This is all new to me - forgive my nervousness."  I picked up the first note on the podium in front of me and glanced down at it.  And I remembered Dorian's words - be yourself.  This wasn't me.  I set the paper down and stepped out from behind the podium.  One man stood up and spoke loudly.  "I knew this was going to be a waste of time."

I stepped forward and amplified my voice with a pattern of air.  "You are free to leave, but I assure you it's not a waste of your time.  Or I wouldn't be here."

I took another step forward and set off a light show of patterns that did nothing really, a soft rain cloud formed along the ceiling, lighting arced from beam to beam, a soft summer breeze rustled the papers in the audience.  I couldn't think of anything to do with earth that wouldn't make a mess so I didn't bother with a visible element.  "How many of you can see the patterns that make up all of these magnus made phenomenon."

A few hands rose up in the air - Dorian's included.

I grinned down at him.  "What if I told you I could teach you to bend those elements?"

The man who had gotten up to leave was standing in the aisle staring around at the phenomenon around him and he slowly rose his hand.  Then he spoke.  "I'd call you a liar."  But he moved back towards his seat.

"I would grant you that leaway.  But I can teach you to touch the elements you beleive you can't.  It's harder in individuals who have been taught already.  But in my neice and nephew I have done so with ease.  Their little minds are eager to absorb the patterns, your's and mine have been hardwired one way.  I just never did it the correct way from the beginning.  Atlas is prof of that."

There were a few nodding heads as people remembered I had created the peice in the lobby.  "Is anyone is willing to come up here with me and let me try to prove my theory in front of you?"

I pointed to the man who had gotten up to leave.  "How about you?  You are sceptical already that will make this all that much harder."

He shook his head.  "Come on." I urged him.  "Can we give him a round of applause to spur that desire to prove me wrong?"

Applause rose in the audience and the man sighed and stood up for the second time and started down the aisle this time.  I met him at the bottom of the stairs and whispered to him as I offered him my hand.  "I won't embarrass you.  I promise.  Nox.  What can I call you?"

He took my hand.  "Ben."

I smiled.  "Alright Ben.  Thank you for coming up on stage."

He mumbled.  "This better be worth it."

I smiled at him and ran my fingers through the wayward strands.  "Ben has kindly agreed to be our proof that I can teach him to touch any element he can see."

"Now Ben.  I'm going to tell you what I think your designation is right now. Have you told me, or do we know each other?"

He shook his head. "I didn't tell you nor do I know you more than a file on the computer."

"I'm sure that was quite the read."  I smiled at him and took a deeper look into his is aura of patterns.  They oscilated at differing frequencies depending on their strength and how many elements they could touch.  I can't see mine so I have no idea what it looks like, but I could clearly see Ben's.  "You are NAA3".

His jaw dropped and he mouthed, "How did you do that?"  He nodded his head in agreement.

I answered the question he had asked because I knew it was the same question on everyone elses mind.  "Every person resonated at a different frequency and the patterns and frequency determine what you are."

I drew in the air with a flaming pen, it left trails of color and sparks as I drew a diagram of the different types of oscilations and what they meant.  

"If you look carefully at everything in this plane you will see these patterns around every living objects and similar around inanimante ones."

"But that's a bit harder to teach in the time alloted.  I'll gladly sit down with you on a one and one basis if you really want to learn."

Ben nodded.  "I'd like to."

"We'll get that scheduled up afterwards.  Are you ready to touch fire?" I asked.

He nodded empathically.  They were starting to beleive me.

I smiled at Dorian in the front row and sat down in front of him on the stage and patted the area next to me for Ben.  I asked, "Can everyone in the back see alright?"

A chorus of yes sounded from the back and I went on.  "Ben you see the glowing red orb in front of me?"

He nodded as I formed it slowly and made sure everyone could see what I was doing.  At least every Magnus or Magnus indeterminate  I suspected there were alot of them out there today in the Scrin.

"Ben.  Think of the color red in your head.  Draw a mental line to the fire ball."  This will connect you to the element.  "Put everything else out of your head."

He tried and he failed.  "Try again.  Clear your mind.  Ignore everything else but the color red.  Don't worry about the people around you, or the next phone call you have to make when this day is over or on our next break."

I watched as the patterns changed around him and fire channeled into his body.  No one else saw it, they weren't watching as closely as I was.  I smiled at him.  "Try this."

I wove the simplest pattern available - a single simple flame.  I wove slow and precise so Ben could follow.  Above his palm sprang a weak but a single flame identical to mine.

The audience applauded as if we'd done something more than a simple trick that any child fire magnus could preform.

I stood up and clapped my hands together in applause.  "Let's give our new fire Magnus a a round of applause."  The crowd added to my applause and Ben hopped off the stage and headed to his seat.  "Thank you Ben."

"That simple trick can link you to the power of the element.  A child can do it because they don't know the hard parts about bending elements yet.  My nephew has been randomly veiling things.  Today I showed him how to do it and he picked it right now.  The younger the mind, the faster the learning.  But it doesn't mean people older than Mark Green our illustrious leader can't learn to bend all four elements if they can see them."

"I assure you that even an Erudite Magnus can pick up all four elements.  It will probably be much harder, but the capability of seeing all the elements is there for everyone.  You just need to retrain your eyes to see them."

I closed with my contact information. I gave them my email address and Dae'lin's as well just in case.  "If you are interested in anything we've talked about today email me or Dae'lin and we'll schedule a time in the next few weeks to go over those topics on a one and one basis."

I walked off the stage happier than I had been when I had started and I didn't make a fool of myself.

## Fire and Bombs

I didn't get far before the blaring of the firealarm startled me and sent a sharp spike through my body.  It was a gut reaction but I was already walking towards the siren.  Not away like everyone else.  Most people abandoned the building when the fire alarm went off.  But each alarm in the AU building was unique.  There was a normal fire alarm that belched out four short burst then a small pause before repeating itself.  It said there was a fire and it needed you to evacuate immediately.

But this wasn't that type of alarm.  When you run an academy for young magnus there was always the off chance that one of them could spark accidentally.  The five bursts were unique to a firestarter started fires and the bursts directly following it indicated the floor, then a small pause told you which wing and area it was in.  The building was laid out in a grid.  To the uneducated it sounds like a normal fire alarm so humans were left to evacuate - only those who lived here really understood the subtle differences.

I found myself in the common area, but I wasn't the first hunter on the scene.  I frowned the moment I saw the back of an older man with peppered brown hair, that used to be the color of my own - my father.  He was speaking to an older version of Dorian.  I had forgotten that his father was my father's partner.  They had worked together since the Academy and if I were to trust the information around they were best friends.

I was about to leave when I let my senses drift and saw floating patterns around the scene that were not connected.  It was like leaves fluttering in the wind.  A man walked through one and it disappaited.  I yelled.  "Hold."

Everyone in the vicinity froze and turned in place to look at me, my father included.  The man who had just walked through one stood next to me and looked curiously at me.  "What?"

"There are stray patterns floating around.  The remenants of the pattern used here."

I looked around and saw all the hurt people.  "If you want to preserve them quickly I  need someone who can remember every detail quickly."  

My father's best friend reached into his pockect as he spoke.  "I know someone."  He started dialing while my father glared at me.  But he said nothing.  Everything was in limbo until we could do something about it.

I started directing people around me to clear the scene.  I gave them directions and they followed them to the letter.  It was a little like the childhood game simon says.  I managed to clear most of the unneed people and cleared the medics to do their jobs in a more convinent place.  They hadn't wanted to move the worst victim - who I sadly knew.  He was my half brother.  He looked up at me in pain, the burns covered half of his body and most of his face.  

I hadn't done this in a while but I fed my half brother all four elements.  I poured them into his wounds and the medics at his side jaw dropped.  They turned to look at me and asked, "What are you doing?"

"Healing, Nick. So shut up and let me work."  It took a lot out of me to do this for such extensive injuries.  I had only healed one such injury to myself before.  It wasn't my first burn, but it was the only one that I didn't have any evidence of its presence.  I was thankful.  I could hear Nick's breathing getting better and the pain in his eyes lessened until he was smiling up at me trying to sit up.

I put my hand on his once scorched chest to keep him lying down.  "Not yet."

The medics didn't do anything as they watched his wounds knit together.  But then they started questioning me.  "How are you doing this?"

There was a tap on my shoulder and I turned to find Dorian standing behind me with a grim frown.  "You needed a photographic memory?"

I nodded.  I pulled the gurney Nick was on and manuevered it through the maze of patterns that were still floating in the air.  "Yeah."  I left the medics to tend to Nick for the rest of his injuries.  He'd live and heal perfectly but I hadn't finished, and now I was feeling a little faint.  Not eating breakfast was paying a toll on me now.  "Can you memorize what the patterns look like and draw them?"

Dorian shook his head.  "The patterns are too intracate.  There is no way I can remember that.  Some are weaker than others."

I nodded.  "Alright, take pictures of the scene.  Memorize where the patterns are floating but don't disturb them."

Kai stood where he had been when I first saw him.  Emilio was already discussing something in a safe area.  I walked over to him and said, "We can deal with this later."

Kai just nodded and followed the same path is father had.  He hadn't said anything to me.  Nothing.  I was surprised.  I wasn't sure what was going on.

I waved my hand, it was a flourishing gesture I used when I was showing off.  I hadn't done it in years but it had been a trick I used when I was around all these people.  In my hand I created a peice of charcol and colored it red first and started drawing on the nearest wall the fire patterns, and blue for water, yellow for air and brown for earth.  Dorian was on my heels.  He was watching what I drew and making mental note of where they were in relation to things.  I hoped his memory was that good.

We worked systematically drawing the patterns and then wiping them from their measely existance until we had completed the job.  Dorian leaned against the wall with a smile.  "Now I guess we have more to talk about over dinner."

I grinned at him.  "I guess we do."

The man who had destroyed the first pattern walked up to us.  "Sorry to interrupt, but is it clear.  We'd like to get this place straightened out."  And he nodded his head in the direction of a group of people who were not so patiently waiting for me.  I had done the unthinkable - I healed someone.  A feat unknown to Magnus.  I didn't want to talk to them.

So I did the next best thing.  I grinned at Dorian and sucked the air from my lungs and passed out in oblivion.

* * *

The darkness left and I started hearing a voice that I remembered and a small smile splayed on my face.  "It's been 15 years since he last tried."  The soft voice of Margo's receptionist spoke in a hushed whisper.

"Are you sure?  He did that on purpose."  Dorian!

I opened my eyes and sat up, my head hurt.  Megan turned to look at me.  "Nox what did you do?  Mr. Vega here is certain is was more than lack of food."

I gave him a lazy grin.  "Sorry.  Yes Megan.  I did it on purpose.  It was a combination of lack of food but mostly lack of oxygen.  There was a mob of people wanting to talk to me, I didn't think I could handle more people than I had already dealt with today."

Dorian was frowning at me.  "So you fake fainting?  You don't have to suck the oxygen from your lungs like that.  I would have caught you either way."  

I couldn't help but smile at that knowledge.  "Faking fainting only works if you can keep a straight face while people fuss over you.  And I didn't think I could manage that feat with you standing there."

Megan looked at me and grinned and stepped into Margo's office to consult with her.  She had been on the phone the entire time with the medics fending them off - saying I was unavailable until cleared by her.

At least that was a good development.  I stood up but when I did I swayed and faster than I could blink and try again Dorian was at my side.  He had an apple and a bottle of water.  I grinned at him.  "Those aren't edible."  

Margo's office was littered with apple relics - and a fake apple tree in one corner and a bowl of apples sat on Megan's desk.  Dorian bit into it and there was a surprisingly wet smack to it.  I knew shock ran across my face.  For all these years I had thought they were fake.

Dorian smiled at me and handed it to me.  I looked at it and stared at it for a moment before my stomach rumbled loudly and I took the sweet smelling apple.  I didn't usualy like eating apples.  I bit into it and was surprised to find it was deliciously sweet and crunch.  Dorian spoke softly, "I brought it with me."

I grinned at him as I took another bite.  I chewed slowly watching Dorian watch me.  I swallowed carefully and said.  "I knew they were fake."

Dorian chuckled but it faded quickly and he frowned.  "Please don't do that again."

I nodded.  "Okay.  I panicked."

Dorian held a finger up to stop me from speaking I bit into the apple again to show him I understood.  I wasn't quite so showy with the rest of apple.  Dorian let me finished eating the apple before he offered me the bottle of water and a napkin.  I took both and wrapped the apple core in the napkin.  Dorian held out his hand and I laughed.  " can through it away."  

He nodded.  "I know.  I got it."

I carefully placed it in his palm avoiding touching him as I stared into his deep blue eyes.  I wanted to kiss him...

Dorian stood up and I watched him walk away as I cracked the bottle.  My eyes were drawn away from Dorian's backside when I heard the familiar clicking of Margo's high heels.  I turned and looked at her.  The scowl present on her face indicated her anger at me.  Dorian was standing just behind her waiting for her to do what she was going to do.

"Sorry, Margo." I appologized.

"What are you sorry about Nox?"  There was white hot fury in her words.

"A lot of things apparently.  I'm sorry I worried Dorian.  I'm sorry I sucked the oxygen from my lungs to fake a collapse.  I'm sorry I worried you and Megan.  I'm sorry I made you fend off the people I didn't want to deal with because I'd had enough of people for the day.  I'm sorry I healed Nick.  Well I'm not sorry about that.  I'm sorry I did it in front of everyone so now I have a horde of people wanting to talk to me about more than just my paper.  Does that cover it all?"  I looked up at her waiting on her verdict.

"Are you truly not going to do it again?"  Margo asked.

I looked behind her at Dorian and nodded my head.  "Yes.  I said I wouldn't do it again."

"Why should I beleive you?  This isn't the first time.  Just the first time you've been caught."

I looked up at Margo.  "I said I wouldn't.  And I try not to lie to the people in this room."

Margo looked back at Dorian and stared at him for several moments.  Dorian just stood there letting her, though I could see the confusion on his face.  He didn't know of the crush I had years ago.  Margo did.  She looked back at me and raised an eyebrow in question.  She didn't have to say anything I knew what she wanted to know.  She wanted to know that if I had feelings for him or if I was playing games with Dorian.  I leaned back against the couch and looked up at her in all seriousness.  "Never before."

She nodded and turned to Dorian.  "I leave him in your care.  He needs to eat.  I'd take him out of the building, I can't fend the medics off much longer."

Dorian nodded.  I wondered why Dorian would agree to being my guardian for the day.  Had he carried me here alone?  He carried me...  I swallowed hard.  I wasn't exactly ready to deal with what I felt for this man.  He looked at me, "Never before?"

I grinned up at him and wrapped my arm around his waist and pushed him forward.  "I'd like to leave now."

He took the hint and opened the door and held it form me placing his hand at my wasit as he did.  It dropped the moment I was through the door.  He lead me down the stairs he said. "I don't suppose that they'll be lurking in the stairwells."

I laughed. "If they know me they will.  But I doubt anyone knows me that well - short of Jace."

Dorian smiled.  "I knew that.  I was surpised this morning to see you entering from the elevator."

"You seem to know a lot about me, that isn't in my files."

Dorian nodded.  "The latter fact came from Dae'lin and Margo in turn when I invited you to the conference I did my research so that I could make you as comfortable as you needed to be.  I didn't know much about you when we were younger.  Short of the hair and make up and the fact that you presented ..."  Dorian was fumbling for a word.

I grinned.  "Gay?"

"Yes.  I didn't want to offend you.  I know there have been women in your past."  Dorian sounded embarrassed by the fact that he knew that.

"Well thank you.  I know a little place not too far from here, if you want to join me for lunch.  I'm starving.  We can talk about what you asked me about and the scene upstairs."  I added quickly.  "That is if you have time.  You don't have to babysit me like Margo suggested."

He smiled.  "I've got to eat too."

## Pumpkin Pie

We walked through the stair well in relative silence, the echo of our footsteps the only sound.  I don't think either of us knew what to say.  It was fairly clear that this was new territory for both of us.  At least with in the walls of the Venatori.

I broke the silence.  "I need to go to my room and grab my laptop."

Dorian nodded and the silence became deafening.  The awkward moments didn't stop as I stepped inside my room quickly to grab my laptop bag and we started back down the stairs.

When we reached ground level Dorian opened the exterior door and it was like the light changed him.  His hand went for my waist as it had every other time he'd preformed the chivalrous act, but this time instead of removing it once I was clear of the door it remained against my waist for several moments longer until we had to pass through the gap in the gate which  Dorian frowned at me about.  "We can walk around to the front."

I grinned at him.  "What's the fun in that?  This is closer."

We walked across the street waiting for the crossing signal of course, but we still almost got ran over by an errant cabby making an illegal turn.  His fare must be precious.  There was a small hole in the wall dinner around the corner from the Apex building.  Dorian looked at me with concern.  I smiled.  "Trust me."

I opened the door from him and Dorian stepped through with the tinkling bell.  A hearty welcome was shouted from behind the counter.  I stepped in behind Dorian and let the door close behind me.  Dorian took only a few steps inside and I walked into him.  I enjoyed the feel of the length of him against my chest and thighs.  "It's okay, they don't bite."  I whispered, "Not unless you want them to."

Dorian nearly choked.  I stepped around him and took his hand in mind.  A plump waitress looked up as she saw me aproaching and I the smile on her face grow as she welcomed me in with her smile.  Her accent was thick.  She was a clear Brooklynite displaced here in the City now.  "Why isn't it Nox.  Been a long time boy."  She reached across the counter and rubbed the neatly grown goatee on my chin.  "I almost didn't recognize you."

She glanced at my hand holding Dorian's as I asked, "My usual table taken?"

She laughed and looked around.  "Does it look like we are busy?"

I smiled.  "Unsually so.  You have two fine customers waiting service."

She laughed and cleaned her hand on her apron and offered it to Dorian.  "Bonnie.  What brings a fine upstanding citizen like yourself into my establishment with this rabble?"

Dorian let go of my hand and took hers in his to shake.  "He's hungry.  Dorian."

Bonnie stepped around the counter and lead the way to my favorite booth.  It was in the back and away from foot traffic so I wouldn't be disturbed while I studied.  She held out her hand inviting us to sit.  "Just like you left it.  We've missed seeing those books scattered all over the table."

I grinned and dropped a bunch of papers on the table, my folder from earlier.  "I'll bring some memories back for you."

She set two menus on the table and we sat down.  Bonnie indicated she'd be back in a few moments leaving Dorian and I alone for a moment.  Dorian picked up the menu and I watched the face he made.  He then looked up at me, "What?"

"Nothing.  I like watching you."  I could feel heat rising in my chest as I admitted the truth rather easily.

Dorian smiled and went back to reading the menu.  "What's good?"

"The pie."

He put the menu down and dropped a level gaze at me.  "You will eat more than just pie."

"Yes, sir."  I grinned playfully at him.  "I was planning on it but you asked what was good here."

"So nothing else is good?"

I shook my head just as Bonnie appeared from the kitchen and set down two glasses of water full of ice and a bowl of corn chips and salsa.  "Alfred said you better try the salsa."

I looked up at her and nodded.  "Yes ma'am.  I'll have my usual."

She looked to Dorian.  "For you?"

He frowned and then looked back at me.  "Trust me."

Dorian nodded.  "I'll have what he's having."

Bonnie nodded.  "Sounds wonderful, you won't be disappointed."  Bonnie took our order to the kitchen.

I took the spoon from the setting next to me and tried the salsa as I had been instructed.  I tilted my head and shrugged it was alright.  I was missing something.  

Dorian smiled.  "Don't eat corn chips?  Are they offending?" 

I grinned back at him.  "Fried food of most sorts and I don't agree."

Dorian nodded and I could tell he was filing that away for later as he muttered, "I'll have to remember that."

Bonnie returned with freshly made rasberry lemonade with real fruit none of that fake powder shit.  She set a glass down for both of us.  "If the drink is not suited to you Dorian.  Let me know and I'll get you whatever you like."

Dorian looked up at her.  "This is fine, but a chocolate milkshake over there looks divine."

Bonnie raised an eyebrow and smiled.  "A man after my own heart.  Coming right up.  It's been a very long time since Nox had one of these.  I almost have the gall to bring him one too.  But I'm afraid it would just melt."

Dorian nodded.  "I'll get him to try mine."

Bonnie leaned in and whispered.  "His weakness is chocolate I'll be sure to make it extra chocolately."  She got up and smiled at me and then went to make the shake.  She didn't know I had heard.

"You heard that didn't you?"  Dorian asked.

I nodded.  "Extra chocolately."

Dorian chuckled, "She doesn't know what you are?"

I shook my head.  "None of us.  She's a regular old human who's been working here for years.  Her mother owed the joint.  Now she does."

I pulled out my laptop and set it on the table and was thankful all the pictures were in my email when I turned it on.  I didn't want to have to spend the time to upload them from my phone.  

Dorian shook his head.  "Right to work, eh?"

I looked up at Dorian.  "I thought that was what you wanted."

"The case is depressing."  Dorian said flatly.  He smiled.  "Let's talk about you."  A small flash of red crossed his cheeks as he continued.  "How you see the world.  I want to know how you do it."

I smiled.  "I do like talking about myself."

Dorian nodded, "So I've heard."

I laughed.  "You really did go around asking people about me?"

"Yes.  I had a very long conversation with Jason Hill.  He was informative."

"Was he now?"  I was sure Jace was not very informative in the sense that Dorian wanted.

Bonnie stopped at the table and set a foaming and frothy frilly glass of chocolate in front of Dorian and dropped two more straws on the table.  "Here you are sweetie.  I'll go check on your order."

Dorian stuck the straw in the mass of frozen chocholate with chocolate swirls dropped on top to make it look even fancier.  He pushed the drink towards me.  He didn't say anything just stared at me with a knowing smile on his face.

I took a deep breath and took a swollow of the overly sweet concocation.  I was not a big sweets eater but Bonnie was right, chocolate was my only weakness.  It was cold and I had an instant ice cream headache.  But it was divine.  I pushed it back towards Dorian.  He raised an eyebrow, "And?  Would you like to share?"

I shook my head.  "No.  It was good, but it'll ruin my lunch."

Dorian laughed.

Bonnie brought out two plates of pumpkin pie first.  There was a douse of whip cream on them both, one was much smaller and I knew it was mine.  Bonnie had been serving my food for over 20 years she knew exactly what I wanted and how I liked it.

Dorian shook his head, "Ruin your lunch?  Pumpkin pie?"

Bonnie smiled.  "It's his favorite.  And it's protocol to eat desert last.  Thus our not so little rebel here eats it first.  I take it he didn't want more?  Ruin his meal?"  Bonnie rolled her eyes.  "He'll finish the pie, and eat lunch and still be hungry."

"That was along time ago Ms. Bonnie.  I don't eat quite as much as my teenage self did."

I took a bite of the pumpkin pie without any whip cream and closed my eyes.  It was sweet and spicey and perfect.  The texture was smooth and I was in heaven.  I had missed this.

When I opened my eyes Dorian was watching me and Bonnie had left to see to other customers.

"I take it that means it was worth the wait?"

I nodded.  "Yeah.  I missed this."

"Do you want mine?"  Dorian asked.

I shook my head.  "No that's okay.  It'll ruin the rest of the meal."

Dorian laughed.  "You can take it with you then."  He lifted the chocolate milk shake .  "This is plenty enough to ruin my own meal."

I could feel the smile on my face.  I would gladly take the pie home.  Dorian had no idea how much I liked it.  But from the happy grin on his face he was getting the idea.

We didn't speak at all while I enjoyed the pumpkin pie.  I could feel Dorian's eyes watching me take each bite and savor it.  I wondered what was running through his head.  "Penny for your thoughts?"  I looked up to find him stirring the milkshake absently staring at me.

He smiled when my eyes met his.  "Just watching you enjoy."

I put on my best cocky grin and leaned forward so I whispered so only Dorian could hear.  "I'm sure there are more fun things I could let you watch me enjoy."

Dorian's face turned a shade of red I didn't think possible as he looked down.

I took a deep breath and reached across the table and touched Dorian's hand.  "I'm sorry.  My mouth gets away with me sometimes."

He looked up and I could see the lust in his eyes.  "There is no need to apologize.  My thoughts were running a smiliar line."

I cocked my head with a grin.  "Oh really?"  The thought that he wanted me was a huge turn on and I couldn't help but bite my bottom lip.  It was something I rarely did.  More of that shy awkward boy who was new to the whole thing.

Dorian whispered.  "You shouldn't do that."

"Do what?"

"Bite your bottom lip."

"Why?" I asked confused.

"Because it maks me want to bite it, " whispered Dorian in a husky lust filled voice.

My stomach rumbled just was I was about to tell him we could go someplace else.  

Dorian laughed. "I guess that means we stay here a little while longer."

I nodded.  "Guess so.  Rather disappointing."

Dorian put his hand on top of mine.  "Not disappointing.  Prolonged."

I smiled.  There was no question about this.  He wanted me as bad as I wanted him.  

Bonnie chose that moment to bring our lunch to us.  It was a steak with a garden salad as a side and asparagas roasted with lemon and garlic.  I hoped it tasted as good as it smelled and better than I remembered it.

Dorian looked up at Bonnie, "This wasn't on the menu."

"Never is."  She said.  "But he's one of the best regulars we had.  It was a special when he was young and my mother cooked for him.  We still make it for the regulars that remember it."

"I will have to remember that."  He smiled and took a bite of the asparagus and let out a soft moan of enjoyment.  It sents all kinds of feelings through my body.  Dorian said.  "It's delicious.  I can see why Nox likes it here."

Bonnie smiled.  "And for other reasons.  But yes the food is one."

I laughed.  "Go away now."  I added.  "Please."

Bonnie did as I asked but Dorian caught my attention.  He looked like he almost wanted to scold me and I frowned.  "What was the other reason you came here."

"Other than the food and to study? you mean?"  Dorian nodded.  "A guy I was screwing around with worked here."

"Oh."  Dorian started eating and I didn't know what to say now.  I watched him for several minutes trying to think of something to say but I couldn't so I started eating.  As soon as I wasn't looking at him anymore and my fork hit my plate he said.  "Does he still work here?"

I shook my head.  "No.  He hasn't stopped working here when he went to jail."

"Why did he go to jail?"  Dorian sounded shocked.

"He was a pedophile. Got caught."

"How old where you?"  

Dorian was angry now.  I could hear it in his voice and see it in his face when I looked up.  "Old enough to be his victim.  But I wasn't.  I wanted everything we did together."

"Is that why you wanted Bonnie to leave?  So she'd not say anything?"

I shook my head.  "No.  If you asked I wanted to be the one to tell you."

"Why?"

I looked down at my plate and moved the peices of steak around on my plate before I looked back up to met Dorian's eyes.  He was standing up ready to leave.  "I don't beleive in lying to people I want more with."

"More?  What the fuck does that mean to you?"  

Dorian was still standing and I looked down at my plate.  "More means more.  Not just sex.  Not a romp in the sheets.  I want other things than I did when I was home last.  Or here ever.  But my past is full of shit like this Dorian.  If that fact makes you uncomfortable, it's probably best it doesn't go father then this."

Dorian turned and walked away.  I watched him but he didn't go to the door he want into the kitchen and I could hear him and Bonnie talking and Alfredo chiming in every so often but I couldn't make out what they were saying.

I fought the urge to curl up in a ball like I used to do when I was a little boy and be the frightened kid who used to come here and wait for his friend to show up.  I had wanted everything.  He didn't tell me to say that.  I wanted to be loved.  I know that now.  And I know it was abuse and I was a victim.  I know that now.  But Dorian didn't give me a chance to explain myself.

When Dorian returned my plate was clean and my glass was empty.  He sat down, he looked calmer and he started eating.  I leaned against the wall and put my feet on the bench and tried not to pull my knees to my chest.  I wanted to.  It was comforting.

Dorian spoke softly.  "Bonnie explained."

"Did she now?"  I wasn't happy that he went to someone else for information about me.  His research into me was starting to piss me off.

"I didn't know how bad off things were for you as a child." I didn't look at Dorian.  I didn't want to cry.  I didn't want to remember the things I did.  "Bonnie told me, that you were his first vicitim.  She turned him in."

"I know.  I was pissed at her for months."

"Why?"  I could feel the judgement in his voice.

I looked up at Dorian and slammed my feet on the floor and hit my knee in the process.  "Because it was the closest fucking thing I had to love at the time.  Dylan had beaten the shit out of me two weeks prior for kissing him.  My mother left me with a fucking pschyopath and my father could give a flying fuck about me.  I was feeling rejected, and just plain depressed.  He was nice to me, and it was better than slitting my wrists.  He helped me through a difficult time.  He was the first man I had sex with."

"Nox.  He raped you."

"You don't rape someone who wants it.  I don't care if you think I was too young to understand the ramifications.  I understand he abused me.  He hurt me in more ways than one.  He only added to the shit I deal with on a daily basis and its my own fucking fault.  So don't get on your fucking high horse and tell me what happened.  I fucking know.  I've dealt with it.  I've learned from it.  I'm not fucking in therapy so I can sleep on the couch or ramble on about how my life is shitty.  I deal with my fucking problems."

"Maybe you are right?  Maybe this should end here."

I felt the sting of tears in my eyes.  Rejection.  I turned and leaned back against the wall.  "It's not what I want, but if that's what you want. Fine."

"What do you want?"  Dorian's voice was calm and caring and he sounded like he really wanted to know.

I stared out past the end of the booth watching Dorian from the corner of my vision.  He was sitting again and watching me.  I felt the first tear fall.  And before I knew it more were falling.  I wiped angrily at my tears with the back of my hands  Black lines smeared across my hands.  I was going to look like a freak show after this.  Dorian stood up and sat down on my bench and picked up my legs and placed them over his and he moved closer.  His hand touched my cheek and he wiped away the tears.  "Why does that question make you cry?"

I looked down and closed my eyes.  But Dorian lifted my chin with his fingers and wiped away the tears and cleaned the smeared make under my eyes.  I grinned at him.  I didn't want to tell him the answer to either question but I did anyway.  "I want my own family."  It was just a hoarse whisper but I told him my deepest desire. "I want to be safe and loved and wanted."

Dorian asked, "How long did it take you to figure this out?"

"Until recently.  It's why I'm home for a while."

"That's what you meant by more?"  He asked.

I nodded.  The tears stopped flowing and I couldn't look Dorian in the eye.  His fingers pulled my chin in his direction.  "What's wrong?"

I shook my head.  I didn't risk opening my mouth otherwise a sqeaky voice sound off that nothing was wrong.  I hated being weak.  We sat in silence for a long time.  Dorian poked at his plate and I stared off into nothingness thinking about my shitty childhood.  I had only made matters worse most of the time.  

Dorian finally broken the silence and wallowing in self-pity.  "Can I ask you a question?"

I shrugged.  Dorian whispered, "You said your mom left you with a pshycopath.  What did you mean?"

I frowned.  I had blurted that out in the midst of the anger that had risen inside of me and Dorian remembered everything.  If he didn't bring it up now, he'd do so later, so I had better just tell him.  "My first mentor abused me - beat me.  But it's neither here nor there, there is no proof to what I say."

Bonnie stood at the end of the table and frowned.  "Except the scars on his back."  She set down coffee and some water for us and picked up the empty dishes.  "I didn't mean to interrupt.  I'll go now."

Dorian looked at me and stared like he was seeing an alien.  I looked away I didn't want to see his deep blue eyes feeling pity for me.  "Technically, I did that to myself."

Dorian asked, "What do you mean?"

I put my legs back over the bench properly and turned my back to Dorian.  I pulled the dress shirt from the back of my pants and lifted it to show Dorian.  "Technically it was my ability that did that.  He made me hurt myself.  He beat me in my head everyday until I hurt him back."

"A dreamwalker?"

I nodded.  "Yes. I learned how to control my ability though."


Dorian dropped my shirt and turned me around to face him.  "Shit, Nox.  Is there anything else horrible you want to drop?"  He smiled slightly he really didn't want to know more, but he was making a small joke of it.

I smiled back and shook my head.  "Not right now.  That's probably enough for a first date."

Dorian laughed, "Is this a date?"

I smiled.  "You said it was."

"I remember."

I took a sip of the coffee, it was as horrible as I remembered it to be.  I looked over at Dorian and wished this had gone better.  "I need to vent some of this anxiety."
## Demons Behind Orange Doors

Dorian asked me, "What do you normally do?"

I grinned.  "Throw fireballs."

He smiled.  "You could show me how."

"Really?"

He nodded.  "Testing your theory.  Even though I've seen it in action.  Nothing better than doing it yourself."

I nodded and he got up and dropped a hundered dollar bill on the table.  I could feel the shock in my wide eyes.  He only smiled at me.  "It was worth it."

Dorian wrapped his arm around my waist and walked me out the front door and he asked, "Where to?"

"A fire room would be best."  I said trying to hide the fear in my voice.  My demon's lurked behind those orange doors in the AU building.  I always found it amazing that my favorite color to this day is the color those doors are painted.  Maybe it's my mind's way of saying you can't scare me.  But they were very unsettling.

Dorian's arm remained around my waist the entire way through the lobby and to the elevator - he only removed it so we could pass through the doors.  He had been very hands off before and I wondered what had changed.

The elevator dinged open and a half a dozen people filed out and we stepped inside.  Dorian's hand still on my waist.  I leaned against the wooden bar and half against him as he held me close.  I could smell the soft scent of vanilla and a touch of cinamon.  He always smelled that way to me, even when I first met him.  I whispered.  "What's changed?"

He looked at me, our faces a hair's breath apart.  I wanted to kiss him so bad as I looked into his deep blue eyes.  He whispered back, "What do you mean?"

I took his fingers in mind.  "This."

He smiled at me.  "Your candor."

"My candor?"  Being honest.. I was slightly confused.

Dorian whispered softly in my ear.  I could feel his warm breath against my neck and it sent shivers down my spine.   "You bared your soul to me.  I can do the same."  Those words made more sense to me than him telling me straight out.  Dorian Vega was always perferct.  He had perfect grades.  His clothes were always perfectly pressed.  His hair always perfectly kept.  In all things Dorian was perfect.  His image was everything.  He was tarnishing his image to bear his soul to me - to show the world that yes, I'm gay.

The elevator dinged and  people piled on the elevator with us, I started to step away once I heard the sound of the door opening but Dorian was firm in his embrace and I didn't push too hard to stay close to him.  I felt his arm tensing and I could see the patterns shifting around him.  He was nervous.  I hummed a little tune under my breath in Dorian's ear.  The song was a comfort to me when I was anxious.  I found myself humming it a lot.

We finally got to the Academy levels and got out and headed down the halls towards the training centers.  Dorian's arm slipped from my waist and he took my hand in his.  His hand was warm and I hadn't realized how cold I was.  The halls were empty save for a few students who were late to class.  Dorian asked softly, "What was that you hummed?"

"A dragon's lullaby my Nanny use to sing to me.  I've forgotten the words and never knew the name, but it's always been a comfort to me."

Dorian smiled.  "It was nice."  We arrived at one of the first available fire starter room and the orange painted door was closed but said it was vacant.  I stared at the color that I could tolerate except for painted on a flat metal door.  Dorian opened the door and I was frozen.  It had been years since I'd stepped foot in one of these rooms.

"Everything alright?"

Dorian had let go of me and was standing in side the room of my nightmares.  I probably had used this room, or maybe not.  They were all identical - the orange painted door, the metal encasing the room inside.  Inflamable furniture.  There was no plastic inside - just in case there was a fire.  It would heat like an oven, but the fire supression would kick in and put out the fire.  These were the safest rooms in the building in case of fire.  I hated them.

But they were the safest place to through fireballs when you wanted to vent.

Dorian asked again.  "You okay?"  He didn't seem upset about repeating himself -  more concerned than anything.

"Yeah.  Just brings back memories."

Dorian stepped behind me and closed the door and picked up his phone and made a call.  I didn't pay attention as I stared at the far wall. A wall I saw every night in my nightmares.  It wasn't always this prestine and shiny.  It ususally wasn't.  But this was a room filled with nothing but terror.  I could feel it oozing off of me.

Dorian stepped up next to me.  "The camera and mics are off.  What's wrong Nox?"

I blinked at him like I didn't understand what he said.  Maybe I didn't really.  I couldn't phathom why he'd do that.  "Bad memories."

"Tell me about them."

I shook my head.  "I'd rather not.  My demon's lurk behind orange doors."

Dorian nodded and sat down on the floor crossleged and he patted the spot in front of him.  I looked at him before it dawned on me he was trying to ease my fears and push me into the reason we were here, to teach him to throw fireballs.

I took a deep breath and sat down in front of Dorian with my legs crossed, our knees touched and I stared across at the man I'd had a major crush on when I was much younger.  Now it felt like so much more than a crush - so much more consuming.

I held out my hands and wove a pattern of fire in a neat ball above my hand.  I could feel the heat, but it didn't burn me.  Dorian glanced at the ball of fire.  I intoned my instructions.  "Think of the color red and draw a line from yourself to the ball."

Dorian closed his eyes and I watched him even though I couldn't follow what his eyes told me, but I didn't need to.  There was a clear visible red line drawn from Dorian to the glowing red orb in my hand.  "That wasn't so hard." Dorian congradulated himself.

I smiled.  "Do you want to do it with the other elements?"

"Why not."

I let the small orb go and formed a blue one in it's place - water.  It was my heardest element but I could weave it faster than most Magnus could who were strongest in water.  It said a lot about the preceived power I held.  

Dorian drew the line with ease.  We did the same with air even though he already thought he was connected.  But when he finished he opened his eyes and mouthed, wow.  He was feeling the new power flowing inside him - the realization that everything he'd been taught was wrong.  It was a powerful effect.

Dorian did the final element of earth and I stood up.  "Let's play catch."

My idea of throwing fireballs had slipped away in the moments I watched Dorian enjoying the new power.  I was more than happy to vent my anxiety in a more productive way.  I formed four orbs one for each element.  "The object is to catch the orb with the correct weave so that it doesn't disappaite."

I wove a net of air that caught the ball of air in front of me when I tossed it up to show Dorian what I meant.  "The elemental net will feed the ball so it can make the distance.  We'll start closer together, then we can move apart."

I first tossed Dorian the air orb and he caught it easily.  Air was his primary element.  And since he couldn't handle more than one at a time, I instructed, "Toss it back."  He did so and I caught the air.  "Earth next."

I tossed each element to Dorian a few times declaring which I was sending over first so he could get the appropriate weave up.  And then I started just tossing randomly at him.  He dropped quite a few of them without the appropriate warning.  But he never was discouraged.  He was doing better than anyone I had ever seen on their first day in the Academy at Magnus training.  Though we didn't do this.

Dorian's phone rang and he frowned.  "I need to take this."

I nodded and took a few steps away and formed a fireball and drowned myself in the noise of the patterns around me.  I focused on the feel of the heat from my creation and then I sent it flying towards the wall and watched it splatter in an array of sparks of oranges and yellows.  My favorite color was one of the first colors to splatter across the wall and I let the image linger in my mind as I created the next.  I focused only on the fire and the splatter.  There was nothing but me and the fireballs.

Dorian touched my arm and I jumped.  I looked at him and saw a frown etching lines into the corner of his eyes.  He spoke calmly, "There has been an emergency.  I need to go handle it.  I'd like to pick up the discussion we didn't have at some point."

I nodded and smiled.  "My schedule will always be open for you."

He laughed. "I will make sure your calendar is free.  If Dae'lin is to be beleived you are nerotic about it."

I nodded.  "Have to be."

Dorian paused for several moments I could almost see the smoke coming out of his ears as he thought about something.  He looked like he was searching my face for some answer.  I wanted to kiss him - to taste his lips.  I swallowed hard as the desire started to over come me.  He gave me a lazy smile and whispered softly, "I will see you again. Very soon, Nox."

I could only nod, my own desires leaving me breathless.  Dorian chuckled as he left.  I stood staring after him.  I don't know how long I stood there before the worst possible thing that could happen to me happened - Garrett Spencer walked into the room and locked the door behind him.## The Demon

I swallowed hard.  I lost all feeling in my body.  I was amazed I was still standing after my reaction.  But I stood frozen as I would have as a five year old child I had been so long ago when I'd seen the man last.  I had done everything possible in every trip and every year in the Academy to avoid this man and he was intruding on my safe moment.  My heart started to race.  I could feel my palms sweating in my clenched fists.  

He smiled that slimey smile that everyone else thought was endearing.  I knew exactly what it meant.  He had me cornered.  I had no place to go.  I was his.

He took a few steps towards me and I stepped backwards not wanting to be any closer to him than I had to be.  His steps out paced mine and he was on top of me as my back hit the wall I had been throwing fireballs at.  I could still feel a slight warm in them.  Tenticales rose up over Garrett - air.  The cameras were off, not that they would catch the patterns he weilded.  My eyes went wide in fear.  My mouth went dry and I bit back the fear that was about to come out of my mouth.  

Garrett only smiled at me.  He stood waving the air tentacles behind him.  I could feel my knees starting to shake.  I was five all over again.

Garrett spoke in that quiet voice that scared me even more than what he was about to do to me.  "Turn around, my boy."

I shook my head.  But it was all I could do to not turn around at his command.  He waved his hand and one of the tentacles lashed out against my cheek and I could feel the knitting process begin.  "I am in control Nox.  Remember that."

He moved his index finger in a circle repeating his insturctions non-verbablly.  My body moved out of fear.  The will to survived overpowered the logical reason in my head.  Garrett laughed.  "Very good."

He reached around from behind me and started to unbutton my shirt.  "We don't want to ruin this fine peice of clothing."  It wasn't the first time Garrett had undressed me for similar reasons.  I vowed to myself it would be the last.

I felt his familiar touch down the length of my spine and I wanted to cringe and cower on the floor but I didn't move.  "Ah.  The memories."

Garrett had only physically hit me a few times in the course of the year we'd been together.  Today he choose to renew his interest in my flesh anew.  He brought down his open hand against the tender scars from early this morning.  The smack of flesh on flesh made we want to yowl in pain.  It wasn't the pain of the blow but the pain of the mind.  The fear welling up inside of me.  I was terrified.  But I did nothing to stop him.  I fell to my knees to remove myself from his hands but that had been a mistake as he rained down a series of blows from the air tentacles.  I bit my lip to keep from making any sounds.  I could taste blood in my mouth as I'd bitten through my lip.  

I waited with my eyes clamped shut for more blows to follow but nothing came.  I opened my eyes and turned to see if he was there.  I tried moving so he wouldn't see me but he wasn't there.  I stood up and grabbed my shirt and pulled it on.  I didn't have it buttoned yet as I left the room and ran into Dorian again.  He must have just missed Garrett.  I looked up and down the hall and didn't see him.  Had it been a figment of my imagination.  Was Garrett haunting my waking dreams?  Fuck!  I was so confused.

Dorian ran his finger down the healing mark on my cheek.  And glanced down at my exposed chest.  He didn't say anything.  "Did I miss something?"

I started to shake my head but I thought better of it.  "Yes."  It came out barely a whisper.  Dorian turned me towards the orange doored room and I froze.  "I don't want to go back in there."  Even I could hear the fear in my voice.

Dorian took me by the hand and lead me away.  "That's alright.  Come on."  

I followed numbly wherever he was taking me.  I didn't even follow the turns and stairs we took.  But Dorian never let go of my hand, even when we passed people in the halls.  

We ended up in the adult residences.  Dorian pulled out a key and opened the door to what I assumed was his apartment.  Normally I would have noticed the decor and soft scents that welcomed me when I entered but my body was numb.  Fear was etched in my blood.  I needed to do something, but I didn't know what.  I needed to go.  

"No.  Nox you don't."  Dorian said and took my hand and sat me down in a red swiveling bar stool with a back at his kitchen bar.  "Sit."

He walked around me and frowned.  "Take your shirt off."

A smart comment was lost on my lips as I complied, the reminants of Garrett's control coursing through my veins.  I pulled the black shirt off and I could feel the fabric sticking to the healing wounds.  It should hurt I thought to myself.

Dorian touched my back tenderly and I winched under his gentle touch.  "It's healing - slowly."

I nodded.  "It always does.  Repeated trama.  Scar tissue doesn't heal as fast."

"Can you do what you did for Nicholas?"  Dorian asked.

I shook my head.  "I can't do anything right now."

Dorian turned the chair so I was facing him.  "Why not?"

I shrugged.  "I can't feel anything.  It won't be controlled."

"Okay.  Then go lie down on the bed and I'll get something to help it heal faster."  Dorian headed towards the bedroom.  When I didn't immediately follow.  "Come on Nox it's this way."  He pulled me off the bar stool and in the direction of his bedroom.  This should be something more intamate.  I was lost in my own head.  I couldn't find my way out.

"This was Garrett?"

"I didn't tell you his name."  I stopped in the hall way before reaching the bedroom door.  

Dorian looked back at me.  "I looked it up.  It's my job to know things like this."  He grabbed my hand.  "There may be no proof but I can make sure he doesn't get young impressionable minds that don't have any defense against his ability."

I followed with little resistance.  Dorian opened his door and I was surprised to find it a stark difference from the rest of his living quarters.  Where everything else was shades of gray, his bedroom was painted blue and everything else was bright and blue.  The window let in sunlight.  The rest of the house had been closed off to the sun.  I stood staring in the doorway while Dorian went to the bathroom arond the corner.  I could hear running water.  I took a step inside.  It was the first voluntary move I'd made.  I smelled more cinamon and vanilla here than anywhere else in his house.  I closed my eyes and took a slow deep breath.  

I could feel the tension leaving with each breath.  I opened my eyes and laid on my stomach across Dorian's bed and I could smell Dorian all over the covering.  I buried my face in the blue comfortor.

I felt Dorian sit down on the soft bed.  I winced when he touched my back.  "Garrett did this?"

I didn't really know.  I was doubting my sanity.  "I don't know."  It came out muffled and I had to turn my head to the side and I repeated myself.  "I don't know.  I don't know if he did it, or if he invaded my day dreams."  He's never done that before.

Dorian nodded as he tenderly cared for the lashes across my back.  Whatever he was putting on it stung and I could feel the increased crawling of my skin stiching itselft back together.  I watched the man's expression change as he applied the green looking salve to my back.  Dorian asked, "You were day dreaming?  About what?"

I could hear the hope in his voice and I looked over at him and he met my eyes.  "Honestly.  You.  I was watching you walk away and thinking about ... things".

Dorian chuckled, "Things?"

"Do you really want me to spell it out, Dorian?"  I sat up and turned towards him.  His body was as close as humanly possibly to me without being in my lap.  

Dorian felt uncomfortable or that's the impression I got from the way he swallowed.  I asked.  "Do you want to know what I was thinking about, really Dorian?"

He nodded.  I leaned in close and I could smell his perfect scent, the cinamon and vanilla were over top his scent but not.  I could get lost in it.  I whispered.  "I was thinking about how much I wanted to kiss you.  How much I wanted to see you naked.  To touch your skin and feel your body against mine."

Dorian's breathing had increased and I could feel his warm breath against my neck.  Dorian whispered.  "I need to finish your back."  His voice sounded breathless and he didn't really want to.  But I pulled back and saw the lust in his eyes.  He was fightin the temptation.  I laid down on my stomach and let Dorian finish what he had started.  His hands were delicate against my skin.  I focused on each touch.  My breath quickedn with each one.  It wasn't the intamacy I had been dreaming about since meeting him, but it was better - because it was free will and not about sex.

My back hurt less and the crawling had stopped. Dorian was wiping the excess salve from my back with a damp towel.  When he was finished I felt the bed move and Dorian's weight removed from the bed. I looked back at him and saw him unbuttoning his shirt.  I turned around and sat up and watched him remove the button up shirt.  As each button unfolded I saw the beginnings of a dark tattoo across his chest.  

He wasn't built like Jace or most other Venatori that I'd seen naked.  I hadn't really been with a scholarly type before.  He had defined muscles everywhere but they were softer.  The tattooo covered his chest and when he removed the shirt completely I saw it covered his arm from shoulder to just above his wrist.  Dorian's hand fled to his waist and I grabbed them and shook my head.  "No."  I pulled him close to me between my legs and kissed his chest.  "This is enough."  I licked and nibbled at his chest then looked up at him.  "Is that okay?"

He nodded and pushed me backwards I crawled up higher on the bed and Dorian followed.  His hot breathe against my skin.  I pulled him to my lips and felt his soft lips against mine.  He bit my lip softly and a moan escaped before I could stop it.  Dorian's mouth trailed along my chin and down to my ear and my throat.  He used the perfect amount of tongue and teeth and I was putty in his hands.  His hands were soft and gentle acrossed my body and I was in heaven touching the taunt soft skin of his back.  

Dorian sat up abruptly and took my hands that had fallen to his thighs as he sat on my hips staring down at me.  There was something primal in his eyes and it stirred things deep down inside.  Dorian drew my hands above my head starting from my sides his hand caressing my skin.  He pinned my hands there with both of his.  His body on top of me.  He kissed me deeply and I knew Dorian wanted to play rough.  My mind started to panic.  I wasn't ready for that so soon after Garrett.

Dorian pulled back slightly and I managed to stutter out.  "Yel..St..stop."

Dorian sat up and let me go.  I let my hands hang limp where he'd left them.  "I'm sorry."

Dorian got up and I followed him.  "Dorian...Stop."

He did and I pressed my body against his back wrapping my arms around his waist.  "Just not today."  

He turned around in my arms.  He looked at me but didn't say anything.  "I only have two rules." I leaned in and kissed him softly on the lips.  I pulled away enough to speak, his forehead against mine.  "No hitting."  

Dorian nodded. "And two?"

"We use safe words."  He nodded.  "Yellow means slow down, you are too close to my limits.  And Red means stop right now."

He chuckled.  "You've read Fifty Shades of Grey."

I nodded.  "Yes.  But they've been around for years before that.  It is what I was taught to use."

Dorian pulled away, "Taught?"

I sat down on the bed.  "Yes.  For when things get rough and out of my control."

Dorian sighed and walked into the bathroom.  I wanted to follow him, but I stayed where I was.  I could hear the water running and hear Dorian muttering to himself but I couldn't make out the words.  The water turned off and Dorian stepped out with a blue towel drying off his hands.  He stood in the doorway and asked softly, "Do things generally get out of your control?"

"Depends on the person.  Usually.  By the time we've started what we just did I have already stated my rules and they theirs.  A negotiation of sorts."

"All before you have sex?"

I nodded.  "Yes.  There are a lot of things you don't know about me Dorian."

"I'm beginning to see that.  So this wasn't your normal routine.  Why?"  He asked.

I looked down at my lap and bit my bottom lip.  Dorian stepped closer and knelt down at my knees and titled my chin.  "Why?"  He asked again softly.

"I already told you why."  I sighed and fell back against the bed.  "I wasn't planning on this.  Wasn't ready.  I want more Dorian.  Not just sex.  If I wanted just sex I would have already made that move."  I sat up.  "You are fucking goregoeous.  I've wanted you since I was 15 years old.  And if it had been about sex I would have taken you out, persuaded you to let me come home with you.  We'd have walked back to your bedroom and I would have whispered the rules in your ear as I started kissing on your neck and taking off your clothes.  It wouldn't have gone down like this."

He nodded and asked another question.  "So what happened there?"

He pointed up on the bed.  "You pinned me down.  I could see what you wanted.  I panicked.  Garrett had just had his hooks in me.  I would freak out that close to his abuse.  I trust you not to hurt me Dorian, but the pain of Garrett's work was still fresh on my back."

He stood up and started pacing.  "What did I want?"  He sounded aggravated and embarrassed all at the same time.

"You wanted it rougher than I could handle in that very moment."  I stood up and stopped directly in front of him which made him stop and look up at me.  "I'm okay with that, with rough.  I'm okay with it.  But not today.  My anxiety right now is through the roof.  The conference, the new case, you and then he shows up and I could do nothing to stop him. I hadn't intended for you and I to be this intamite yet.  It scares the fucking hell out of me Dorian. I've never done this.  Never wanted it this much.  Wanted something more, to spend time with someone so much.  I've never held back my desire before Dorian.  This is all so new to me."

Dorian stood with his body pressed against mine where he had stopped.  "I sometimes forget that the rumor about you are usually true.  All the sexual partners, all the cocky attitude and all the risk.  No one ever said you were completely honest."

"Not completely.  No one knows about what Garrett did to me except you."

"You trust me that much from just this one day?"

I shrugged.  "It could be a fantasy world I base it on but yes, Dorian.  I trust you whole heartedly.  I trust you with my demons.  I trust you with my body.  But more importantly, I'm trusting you with my heart.  I will bear my soul to you if you'll let me.  I will give you everything of me. I don't know why but you make me feel safe.  Being with you makes me feel safe. I'm never safe, Dorian."

Dorian kissed me softly and it turned into a passionate kiss that left us both breathless by the end of it.  His hands cuped my face and I grinned at him.  "I'm sorry for all the shit I'm going to put you through.  I'm a mess Dorian.  But I can be yours completely if you let me."

Dorian smiled.  "We need to slow down."  I could feel my heart shattering as he spoke that simple phrase.  "We need to figure out what this all means.  You've given me a lot to think about. Nox.  We need to go slow or we will both bolt."  He kissed me softly.  "I will try with you.  Something that will be hard for me.  Something I don't do.  This type of relationship.  The closest that comes to it is the long term relationship I had with my own best friend.  But that wasn't about more than mutal gratifaction."

I blinked at him.  He'd turned my fear into hope as he continued.  I nodded.  "I should get to work."

Dorian laughed.  It felt good to hear him laugh.  To see him happy.  "You aren't leaving my side until I'm sure you are alright."

I sighed.  "I'm fine.  This isn't the first time it's happened."

"This is the first time it's happened with you awake.  So you will stay with me.  Besides I have a favor to ask of you."

"A favor?"  I winked at Dorian.

He rolled his eyes.  "And we are back to the innuendo and flirting."

I grinned at him.  "Anything for you Dorian."

"I have a 16 year old firestarter who was found on he streets of Chicago who has been presenting his mentors many problems.  I was hoping you'd talk to him be his mentor."  He smiled.  "It's why I was coming back to see if you were still in the room where I left you."

"Okay."  I said.

Dorian handed me a clean black dress shirt.  "Your's is a bloody sticky mess.  I'll have it laundered and left in your room in the morning."

We both got dressed and freshened up.  My make up was smeared beyond recovery.  I was in the process of washing it off when Dorian handed me an eyeliner pencil.  He commented, "Nostaligia."

I grinned at him.  "Thank you."

Cleaned and fresh we left Dorian's apartment to go talk to this troubled boy.## A Fellow Firestarter

I was still running my fingers through my hair straigtening it out.  Dorian was watching me.  I asked him, "What?"

He grinned at me.  "I thought I was vain."

I stuck my tongue out at him.  "It's in my face.  It's annoying."

Dorian stopped and turned me towards him and ran his fingers through my hair and it decided to stay put.  "That will teach you to keep the top so long."

He started walking and I fell in step.  "Does my hair bother you?"  I asked in not quite so seriousness.  I didn't really care if it did.

"Not at all.  I already told you I liked it. Colored tips and everything."

I was serious this time.  "Does anything bother you about my apperance?  Upset your image too far?  I can tone it down."

Dorian sighed.  "You go from flippant to serious in two seconds flat, don't you?"

I grinned at him, "Usually, there is no serious."

"Ah."  Dorian continued.  "No.  You have always had a bold statement.  Always more flamboyant that I am.  But you've grown up.  I expect your repretoire of t-shirts has only gotten worse, but you aren't loud and obnoxious.  You've come into being a normal person."

I laughed. "I've been out in the real world where my ecentricies were barely noticed so why bother."

We stopped in front the doors to one of the training rooms.  Dorian opened the door and let me step in first.  There was no flirting to his movments, his hand stayed by his side and I missed that warm contact, but this was business and I could play my part.  I knew I could.

A boy sat slung over the arm the chairs like he was some pin up cat and worth more than the paper he was printed on.  I was not impressed.  He reminded me of me...  I guess I had grown up a little anyway.

His dark eyes never moved from his phone in his hands.  "Levi."  Dorian said as he shut the door.  "Levi."  Dorian's anger was apparent now in his voice.  And yet the lad still didn't answer.  

Dorian was starting to say his name again but I used a weave of air and fire and made his seat hot.  The boy jumped out of his seat and stared at us with a look that I was sure he wished could kill.

I smiled at him.  "I got this, Dorian."

Dorian nodded. "Okay.  I'll be watching."

I knew he would.  It was a testing room, on the other side of the mirror on the far wall was a room for observers to watch a given test.  Usually for authenticity but sometimes it was used to show off a certain person's skills.  I had sat in this room many times for that express purpose.

"My name is Nox.  You are Levi.  I would appreciate it if you sat down in the now cool seat and talk with me.  I'd hate to have to make it very uncomfortable in here."  I let a flow of fire encase us along the walls.  His eyes opened wide and he sat down quickly.  I smiled at him.  "Good."

The fire winked out as I took a seat opposite of Levi.  "Tell me about yourself."

He just looked at me.  "Alright.  Dorian can you get me his file?"

"While we wait for that, I'll tell you my story."

Levi rolled his eyes at me.  "As if I care."

I shrugged. "Don't care if you do.  You will listen."

Again his eyes rolled and I wanted to slap him.  But I smiled at him.  "Again my name is Nox.  I was born to my human mother."  

The look on his face was close to a sneer.  He stood up.  "I don't want a fucking half human shit for a mentor."

I laughed.  "You won't get better than me."  At that moment I wove a fierce storm of air, water, fire and earth.  Every single thread around me was visible to the naked eye - even a human couldn't miss the swirling patterns around me.  It was a chaotic symphony of power.  It did nothing but showcase what I was.  It was an impressive scene but it was a useless lesson to be taught.  "I am also a natural born Cesari."

The look on his face said he didn't know what that was.  "I can bend all four elements at the same time."

Levi shrugged.  "So can I."  

My show ended abruptly as Dorian opened the door.  "Did I miss the show?"  He asked.

I shrugged.  "Little good it did.  Why didn't you tell me he was Cesari?"

Dorian frowned.  "Because he's yet to prove it to us.  I figured you could tell either which way."

I sighed.  "I didn't look."

Dorian nodded. "Do you want me to stay?"

"Nah, that's alright."  I smiled at Dorian.  "I got this."

His smile was brief and he headed back out the door.

Levi was still sitting in the chair, but more like a proper person than a sloth.  "You like him, don't you?"

"Very perceptive of you."

He shrugged.  "I just see things."

I asked, "What do you see?"

Levi shrugged again.  "It's hard to explain."

"Try me."

"I see connections.  Like strings attached to people."

I was fascinated.  "So each string represents a relationship?  Does the thickness tell you anything?  Or the length?"

Levi shrugged.  

"Tell me what you saw between Dorian and I?  and say Dorian and you?"

"I can't see my own connections."

"That's understandable.  I can't see my own aura either."

Levi sat forward, "You see auras?  What's that?"

"I see the pattern around people.  I know you are Cesari, level 4, natural born.  But I don't see aura's like a human might.  They aren't colors that mean something.  I see a persons gift with the elements."

"So you can see what a person is before they even know?"  He asked.

I nodded.  "I can.  I can teach someone to do it, but it's harder the older they get."

"Can I teach you what I see?"

"No.  Not likely.  My ability isn't the seeing the auras of people it's the ability to figure out patterns.  It see the complicated and make it simple.  To find the answer quickly.  Just knowing what the pattern does without having to experiment."

"Oh."  He seemed deflated.

"But I can help you read your own talent.  If you tell me what you see.  Between me and Dorian - Mr. Vega."

"It was a light pink which I've figure out usually means a new love.  Your end looked thicker and his thinner."

"Any idea what that might mean?"  I knew, I grinned.

"How much love you feel for the other person?"  I nodded.  "So you have great feelings for him and he only a little for you.  That's sad."

"Not really.  The fact that you see it at all is hope to me.  I've liked Dorian for many many years.  It stands to reason I'm father along than he is."  I asked my next question, "What do you think the color means?"

He shrugged and I continued my line of questions trying to let him figure that out.  "Seen any other colors?"

"Yeah."  Levi nodded emphatically.  "All kinds.  Reds, greens, blue and black predominatley".

"Can you peg an emotion with those colors?"  I asked.

"So you are saying that I can tell what kind of relationship it is by the color?"

I nodded.  "That's the working theory of others who have that particular skill.  There is always room for improvement and understanding."

I changed the topic.  "Do you actively use all four elements?"

"I don't know."  Levi shrugged and looked at the wall mirror.  "I just do it."

"I know the feeling."  I leaned back in my chair.  "I revealed myself as Cesari when I was 10 when I made that statue down in the lobby.  I didn't think anything of it.  I was rushing the project so I did it all at the same time not individually like I had been taught.  I had wanted to get back to the rest of that day."

"What day was that?"  Levi asked.

"It was the annual war games and art show.  Every student is tasked with creating either a peice of art or recreating an implement of war in it's full glory, or how we envisioned it.  Left to my own devices I would have done a catapult or trebuchet but my mentor, Dae'lin, insisted that year I do an art project.  She said, and I quote, 'you are more than a killing machine as a hunter, you will act like it.'"

The irony of it really.  Thinking back on it now that statement could very well be the downfall of my career at least my mark on hunter society. The Venatori court system hate hearing my name.

"Have you used all four elements?"  I asked again.  "Can you show me something - anything?"

Levi nodded and wove a complex pattern and I watched carefully as he made tiny changes that were not exactly correct, but something about the pattern nagged at me.  When the pattern was complete it was the shape of a box, but it didn't do anything just sat there. I asked.  "What does it do?"

Levi shrugged.  "Dunno."

Something was oddly familiar with the box.  "Make it go away now."

Levi said very matter of factly. "I don't know how."

"Alright.  I'll do it then.  Won't be as easy to unravel since I didn't make it."

"Wait, you can unravel a creation?  Could I unravel your peice of art down stairs?"

I shook my head.  "No, once an object takes solid form it can't be unraveled, it beocomes real, not just magic.  This is not an object persay.  It still looks like patterns, not like a rock or sand or even water, it's just threads of light, those who can bend all four elements can see.  And because of the intracacy and delicate threads I doubt anyone could see it if they were just seeing one thread of it."

Levi nodded.

I stood up and looked directly at the mirror.  "Dorian, I'm gonna go take Levi to see Jace's class. You want to come?"

I knew the answer would be yes, but I didn't wait for one.  "Come on Levi.  I want you to meet a friend and maybe we'll sit in on his beginner class."

"I'm not a beginner."

"You are if you can't dismantle your own creation.  But I don't beleive you are a beginner.  But it's never to late to see how the younger kids are taught.  You might pick up a few tricks."

I opened the door and let Levi go first.  I followed him out and was greated with a smile from Dorian.  "You think I'm going to let you go alone?"

I grinned at him.  "Didn't dream of it."

Levi groaned.  I asked him, "What?  Making you uncomfortable."

He shook his head. "No.  Whatever cranks your chain.  You two are sappy."

I laughed.  "I have never in my life been called sappy before."

Dorian only shook his head as we walked to the elevator.  I took a deep breath as we stood waiting.  I would not lean on Dorian.  I would not show weakness to a troubled child who would and could use it against me.

Dorian watched me from the corner of his eyes.  I felt that tug to go to him and ease my fears.







## The Jump

The doors opened going up and we waited for everyone to file off.  A smoker had just exited and I could smell nothing but tabacco smoke inside the elevator.  I held my breath.  Two triggers was not going to undo me.

Levi stood in front of us.  I leaned against the wooden rail and stared at my reflection in the door.  I noticed Dorian was watching me through the reflection but I couldn't hold my breath any longer.  I let it out slowly and inhaled shallow breaths trying to avoide the cigarette smoke smell, but it didn't help.  My heart was racing.  My hands were sweaty and I knew I was pale.  Fear raced through my veins turning my body stone cold.  I didn't know if I could move when we stopped.  Dorian leaned in and whispered, "What's wrong?"

I held up two fingers and knew that Dorian didn't understand what I meant, he couldn't.  Levi asked.  "What's wrong with him?"  He didn't sound amused by it actually concerned.

"He doesn't like elevators."  Dorian added, "But this isn't his usual reaction.  Something else is wrong."

The door chimed opened and we got out on the classroom level of the Academy.  My legs were stiff with fear and it hurt to move but I did move.  Dorian never touched me, though I could see the strain as he did.  I took a deep breath of clean fresh air of the Academy.  It still smelled like I remembered - like old musty books.

Levi asked, "You okay?"

I nodded.  "I'll be fine."  I hated that he saw that but it wasn't my fault.  

Dorian walked beside me while Levi followed.

"What happened Nox?"

I shook my head.  "I'll tell you later."  Dorian seemed to except that for now.  I could see the question pending in his head and his photographic memory.  

Jace's classroom was up on the right past an orange fire starter door.  I passed it without looking at it.  I triggered a minor fear but I pushed it aside.  I wasn't going to let my fears rule me anymore today.  That seemed to be all it was doing.

I opened the door to Jace's class room after a quick rap at the wooden door.  All eyes turned to us and Jace looked up from the book he'd been reading from and smiled brightly at me.  "Nox.  Everyone this is my best friend and inspiration, Nox."  He was surprised when Dorian and Levi followed me in. "And it seems Mr. Vega and a guest have come with him.  What ever do we owe for this visit?"

"They are with me."  Jace relaxed visibly.  "You aren't in trouble.  Levi here is a bit green around the edges I thought a couple of sessions here might help.  You invited me remember."

"And Mr. Vega's prsenses isn't an evaluation?"  Jace asked.  It seemed more curiousity than fear that spurred it.

Dorian shook his head.  "I'm not here for an evaluation.  Well, not yours anyway."

Jace laughed.  "You are evaluating Nox?  Come one he won't teach.  He's a hunter.  Born breed and taught to be nothing else."

I reminded Jace.  "So were you.  Look at you now."

Jace shook his head.  "I wasn't born to be a hunter.  Your mother and your father were both excellent hunters even though she was only human.  She brought down just as many baddies as your father in her tenure."

I rolled my eyes.  I hated to be reminded that her record was better than mine.  Kills counted better than a capture.  Most Venatori didn't capture they just took out their marks.  "Good for them."

Jace frowned and looked down and when he looked back up he was smiling.  "Come on.  I know what will help everyone."  Jace looked across the room.  "You feel like jumping?"

Did I ever.  Jace was right, that would help.  Beating my fears back with a stick only worked so far, conquering them on the other hand was a whole knew feeling and I hadn't done it in a very long while.  I grinned at Jace and he laughed.  "I thought so."

"Alright, everyone grab your jackets we are going to the roof."

Dorian looked at me with concern.  I put my hand on his shoulder.  "It'll be glorious.  Trust me.  I will feel better."

Dorian's look didn't change as we lead the class up to the roof.  Levi seemed to be missing.  Fuck!  I looked around and couldn't see him.  Where did he go?

Dorian looked behind me to see what was wrong.  "Damn it.  This is one of the things his mentors get pissed at."

I shrugged.  "What harm can he do?  He's not a child.  We'll find him later.  I need to do this."

Dorian nodded. "Are you sure?  It sounds dangerous."

"I laugh in the face of danger." I laughed in a fake villianouse voice.  It made Dorian smile.  The kids closes to us giggled.

We took the elevator to the top floor.  I didn't hesitate to stand against Dorian and taken in his comforting scent as we rode up to the top floors.  Jace elbowed me in the back and whispered, "Way to go."

Dorian chuckled in my ear then asked, "You do know we've a history right?"

I nodded and whispered back, "Yes. His last fling before getting back with Mia forever.  I couldn't forget that."

Jace asked.  "Does it upset you?"

I shook my head.  "I never had a problem sharing with you Jace.  Though now..." I turned to look at Jace with a grin. "Mine."

Jace laughed as the door dinged open and the children filed out and started for the stairs to the roof.

Dorian and were the last ones out and he stopped me with a hand on my wrist. "You really aren't worried or upset?"

I shook my head.  "No.  It's not news to me.  I was miffed at the time he told me.  But I'm okay with it."

Dorian asked, "Mine?"

I smiled.  "It was something we did when we were younger and were aiming to nail the same person."

"Alwyas so crude?"

"Sorry.  I'll try to pharse it more delicately next time, but it wasn't about the sentimental stuff - not ever."

Dorian asked, "And now?"

I kissed Dorian descretely on the lips, I didnt linger.  I whispered as I pulled away, "Whatever you want, you get."

Jace called down from the stair well, "You two coming?"

I looked to Dorian.  "We can finish this later.  I know you won't forget.  That's four things we need to talk about."

Dorian said.  "Five."

"Five?  What am I missing?"

"You aren't.  But I have something else to ask you later."

I nodded.  "Anything.  And I will be completely honest."  

"I know."

I went up the stairs two at a time, Dorian not so fast.  Once we reached the top the wind was blowing softly and the kids were all wrapping their arms around them.  It felt refreshing.

Dorian stood back by the door.  I stepped carefully towards to edge.  The last time I imagine Dorian was up here was the day I saved him when he fell.  I looked back at him and he was leaning against the wall near the door watching me with those deep blue eyes.  I smiled back at him and he returned it, though it never reached his eyes.  He didn't want to be up here.  

I took Jace aside.  "Tell Dorian to meet me downstairs while I prepare.  I won't be back up after I jump.  Levi took off I need to find him."

Jace nodded and went to do as I asked.  The children chattered behind me.  Jace yelled.  "Make it a spectical."

I had already planned on it.  I took a deep breath about 10 steps away from the ledge I was about to jump off.  I put up a veil around the entire AU building and I heard Jace whistle.  "Damn, you've been practicing."

I shrugged.  "I always held back before."  I held the viel in place and a caphony of weaves circled the entire enclosure.  Reds and blues danced with yellows and brown.  It was the same chaotic symphomy of patterns that I'd used on Levi earlier.  I looked back and I saw Dorian standing in the doorway watching in stunned awe.  When he looked at me I grinned at him and looked forward and ran those ten steps and dove over the edge.  I could hear the wail of the children but it was soon drowned out by the wind whipping past my ears.  

Wings of air formed around me and I sent softening patterns to the ground below.  It always reminded me of the scene in the matrix when Neo bounced off the pavement.  It wasn't really a bounce for me, but it's how I envisioned it when I first created it.  It was an 8 second drop to the ground and it was pure bliss.  

There was nothing but me and the world around me.  Nothing but conquered fears and my ego gloating over defining my innate senses.  

I landed on the soft green grass and I rolled over and held my thumbs up.  I couldn't see Jace leaning over the edge, but I knew he was.  I could look but I didn't have to extend my vision.  I just knew.

I lay on the grass staring up at the swirling syphony and I started to hear a mass of people chattering.  I looked behind me while still laying on the ground.  The world was upside down, but there were Magnus and other Venatori standing on the pavement watching me.  I grined and I let the veil fall and with it the symphony died and exploded into tiny particles that floated to the ground and disappeared.  Specitcal it was.

I heard the alley door open and I saw Dorian standing there holding the door.  I got up and turned towards the lingering crowd and gave a flourishing bow.  I couldn't make out what anyone inparticular was saying but I heard a few girls giggling.  I headed for the door and the caphony of voices rose.  Dorian held the door for me and we stepped back inside the quiet of the empty stairwell.

Dorian grabbed my wrists and pushed me up against the wall and kissed me with passion, so much passion it almost hurt.## Always the Same

Dorian's lips pressed against mine.  I could feel his body pressed against me.  His teeth grazed my lips and our tongues entwined.  Time fled me as I was embraced in the warmth and comfort of that kiss unable to do anything else not that I wanted to anyway.  Dorian pulled away and pressed his forehead against mine and I stared into his deep blue eyes - my heart racing for all the right reasons for a change.  Dorian whispered, "I wanted to do that then."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Why didn't you?  I would have been receptive."

Dorian kissed me tenderly, "You know why."

I laughed.  His friends had dragged him away before we could do more than look at each other.  I was flying from the jump and from the kiss.  "I'm hungry again."

Dorian shook his head.  "This time I think we can work."

I nodded, "If you insist."

Dorian kissed me one last time, bitting my bottom lip as he pulled away.  I let slip a soft moan and he chuckled at me.  "You are easy to tease."

"You are good at it."  I stepped away from the wall and Dorian joined me as we started up the stairs.  We walked the entire way to the common area.  Dorian was winded - I was to a degree, but I was used to hiking in the thin air of the Rocky Mountains for days on end, this was nothing.  

"We didn't have to walk the whole way."

Dorian smiled.  "I know.  I have to keep up somehow."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Oh really?  I can think of a few activities that could increatese your endurance."

Dorian turned that great shade of rose as we opened the landing door and stepped into the hallway and started for the cafeteria.  Dorian took my hand in his and I looked at him with surprise.  He was growing more braizen by the minute.  I was loving it.  I didn't like to hide who I was, and Dorian was fitting into my image and falling so far out of his.  I stopped and Dorian had to drop my hand or he'd have yanked both our arms.  "What's wrong?" he asked.

"Are you doing this for me?  Or because you want to?"

Dorian frowned, "Doing what?"

"Being open about this.  Holding my hand.  Your arm around me.  Even kissing me where people could see.  Is it because you think I want it?"

"No."  Dorian smiled at me.  "Am I doing it because it's you - yes.  But not because I think it's what you want."  He closed the distance and his blue eyes sparkled as I looked into them.  "I do this because I want to.  You don't care what others think.  Let's just say I'm trying to be more like you.  Fuck the image."  Dorian laughed and ran his fingers through my hair.  "I can't pull off what you do, but I can be open about who I am.  I'm trying.  Not because you want me to - because I want to.  I'm a grown man, I don't play childish games."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Good.  I don't want you to change for me.  I like you just the way you are - warts and all."

We laughed and Dorian leaned in and kissed me tenderly.  I could hear people talking about us and hoped Dorian didn't but the tension in his hands told me otherwise.  I bit his bottom lip gently and he pulled away staring at me.  "What was that for?"

"To bring you back to me and not listen to them."  I whispered.

"Thank you." Dorian wrapped his arm around my waist and we walked into the cafeteria with a gaggle of teenage girls giggling behind us.   Things never changed around here.  Dorian glanced back at the girls and they squealed a little before scampering off like the rugrats that they were.

The line in the cafetria was long.  It was later than I thought it was.  We'd spent a great deal of time togeth today - Dorian and I.  I don't think I'd ever done that with anyone other than Jace.

The girls that had been following us were standing in line just in front of us.  They giggled when they saw us standing behind them.  I did not miss teenage girls.  One of the girls couldn't stop staring at me.  I ran my fingers through my hair and grinned at her.  I asked her, "Yes?"

She blushed and looked away but her gaze quickly returned.  She took a step towards us.  "You are the one that just jumped, aren't you?"

I nodded.  "I am.  Why?"

"The whole class thought we were under attack."

"Attack with a light show?"  I snickered.  "I take it they aren't very bright."

She giggled and offered me her hand.  "Daniella Rivera."

I took her hand and lifted it to my lips with a kiss.  "Nox.  I know your aunt."

She nodded. "I know.  She use to complain about you when I was little. He's such a terror.  Why can't he behave.  Why doesn't he act more like X, Y or Z.  On and on."

"Yep that sounds like Dae'lin.  And I remember you though you weren't nothing but an ankle biter then."

Daniella looked at Dorian and then back at me with a flip of her hair to emphasize how long her neck was, she leaned forward and whispered.  "I granduate this year."

I chuckled.  "Congradulations." A small frown played on her lips that were stained a light purple like the skimpy little dress she wore.  Dae'lin would kill her if she saw her in that thing.  

I leaned into Dorian and wrapped my arm around him pulling him close to me.  He hurmphed at the jarring but settled in against me staring off into the crowded cafeteria.  The pout on Daniella's face turned real.  "You really are gay?"


I laughed.  "No.  I'd like you too if you weren't Dae'lin's neice."

Another girl turned around with a fake smile on her face.  "What about me then?"

"Yeah.  Sorry, Duckling.  I've got my hands full right now."  Dorian turned his attention to the two girls and then back at me with a wicked grin on his lips.  I wondered what that was all about.  Dorian dropped his arms from around me and took a step back and leaned against the wall.  He was throwing me to the baby wolves.  "Thanks love."

Dorian stared at me a little stunned at my word choice.  It was sarcasm but I was fairly sure I meant what it implied.

The Daniella's friend moved closer to me.  I looked back to Dorian as she tried to invade my space.  I took a step back.  "Alright.  I know what you've heard.  But Duckling I have a few rules in all those rumors you know about me.  And the first one is I don't ..."  I looked at Dorian and rethought my phrasing.  "I don't do anything with underage persons, I don't do anything with married ones, and I don't like having singler parents for partners on the dance floor."

Dorian was smiling happily behind his hand.  I had passed whatever little test he decided to throw at me.  The girl leaned against me again. "I can give you a better time than he can."  She sneered at Dorian.

I leaned down and whispered so Dorian and Daniella could here.  "Can you now?  You have a cock under that pretty little dress?"

I didn't need to see her hand to know she was going to hit me.  I knew the way her body tensed and I waited for the stinging hand print to make it's impression on my cheek.  I received a second on from Daniella just for good measure I was sure.  The whole gaggle of girls walked off.  I called after them.  "See ya ... ladies."  

I turned back to Dorian who was moving forward in line now that the girls had left the space clear.  "I see nothing changes."

"Sorry."

Dorian pulled me close and I could feel his warmth against my leg.  His hands tenderly ran around the marks that were blossoming red I was sure.  "Not the first time, huh?"

"That I've been slapped?"  I shook my head, "And not likely the last one either."

Dorian leaned in and whispered, "Is that really how you feel about a better time."

I grinned at Dorian.  "You'll just have to wait and see love."

"There is that word again."

"A problem?"  I asked with a calm lift to my voice.  

"No.  Something like your use of duckling?"  Dorian asked.

"Maybe.  Maybe not.  But if it bothers you I'll call you Duckling too."

Dorian laughed as we stepped inside the serving area.  I smiled the moment I got inside and saw Ms. Shiela doling out mashed potatoes and gravy on individual trays.  Her auburn hair was more gray that I remembered it but she still had that motherly look to her.  I poked Dorian with my elbow and nodded towards our server as I said.  "What's a gorgeous dame doing behind some glass partition.  You should be the one being served, not the other way around."

I watched as the fury rose in her cheeks as she was about to spout some anti-sexist remark my way until she saw me and that fury slippied away as fast as the gravy was running down her arm.  "We'll aint you a sight for sore eyes.  I 'eard you was gonna be back."  I loved her souther accent.  Jace hardly ever used his unless his family was around then it came back like riding a bike.  Ms. Sheila never lost hers.

"You waz the one making all that ruckus out there ain't ya?"

I gave her an innocent smile.  "Who me?  Nah.  It was Dorian."

She chortled and nearly dropped her tray.  "That boy ain't got your foolishness about him at all."

I grinned at her and put my arm around him.  "Well, he's got some of it if today's been anythng to say for his foolishness."  I laid a soft kiss against his cheek and he almost hit me.  I felt his arm tense underneath my hand.  I stopped the game and apologized. "Sorry."  I let go of him but he wrapped his arm around me.

"Didja just apologize to the man?"

I nodded.  "Yeah."

Ms. Sheila stepped away shaking her head and headed into the back like she always had when I stepped through her kitchen doors.  Dorian whispered in my ear.  "Don't apologize, Nox."

I turned to look at him.  "I made you uncomfortable. I was out of line."

The girl who was next to Ms. Shiela handed Dorian his tray after he'd decided what he wanted.  The line was being held up and I stepped back to wait on her to get back.  Dorian moved along.  "I'll find us a table." He said before kissing me softly.  "I'll get used to it."

I was grinning madly after Dorian, watching him walk down the rest of the line towards the checkout counter when Ms. Sheila came out carrying a tray.  "I ain't got it all like I used to.  Ya'll gonna be around for while."

I looked back towards the direction Dorian had gone and then back to her.  "That's the plan."

She laughed.  "Maybe ya got more sense then you did as a youngin."

"Doubtful."  I smiled at her with a small bow.  "Thank you ma'am for taking care of me. I don't think I've ever thanked you for that."

Ms. Shiela turned the color her hair used to be.  "Ain't nothin.  Ifin ya want ya'll are welcome to come and cook with me anytime."

I nodded.  "Yes ma'am.  I will."

I made my way to the checkout counter grabbing a bottle of water from the cooler.  I reached for my wallet where my stupid meal card was but the man at the counter smiled and said, "We have you covered for this meal Mr. Sétanta, courtesy of the conference."

"Okay.  Thanks then".  I saw Dorian sitting at a table with others on the end of it.  I took a deep breath and walked towards him.  I could deal with them if they bothered me.  And I expected they would bother me - they always did.

A rather large woman stopped me in the aisle between tables.  "That was quite some show you put on."

I grinned at her trying to remember her name.  Sometimes I wished I had a gift like Dorian and could remember everything at a glance.  But I remembered her.  She had always been larger for a Venatori - our strength and endurance meant that we had high metabolisms - I didn't but full Venatori did.  But she was half human like I was.  "Ren right?  Thanks."

She smiled brightly at being remembered.  "Maybe you can show me how you did it sometime?"

I looked over at Dorian who was watching me with a grin on his face.  Shit!  This fucking progeny thing was going to fucking kill me if I couldn't sit down and eat a meal in peace.  "Maybe.  I need to go.  My boyfriend is waiting for me."

She frowned at my use of words which made me smile inside.  She glanced back where I was looking and Dorian looked down snickering to himself as he sipped at the soda on his tray.  "Boyfriend?  I thought.."

I smiled at her and interrupted, "I do."  I pulled a card out of my wallet that was sitting on my tray.  "Make an appointment.  I'm all sorts of popular these days."  She gave me a happy smile and sat down with her friends.

I made it to Dorian without little more incendent except the people at the end of the table had gone.  So much better.  Dorian looked at me with a grin and reached across my tray and stabbed a carrot with his fork.  "Do you flirt with everyone?"

I smiled.  "I try, Duckling."

He grinned.  "Even the ugly ones?"

There was nothing on Dorian's plate I would touch I stared at it then looked back up at him.  I wished I could eat anything I wanted and look like him... fucking human genes.  I smiled at him to answer his question.  "Especially the ugly ones."

A voice over my shoulder said, "What ugly ones?  You mean you and your _boys_."  I sighed as I recognized the voice as Aaron Woolbright - my former roommate and tormentor.  And also one of the crowd who I was trying to avoid at the end of the table.  

Aaron didn't wait for my answer or my smart remark, he pushed my tray across the table as hard as he could.  The split in the middle caught it and it flew up in the air spilling contents everywhere.  I managed to catch most of it with a weave of air and place it back on the tray on the table where it had carened over.

I stood up and smiled down at the muscular black man who was nearly a foot shorter than I was.  He stared up at me with a glare I recalled from my childhood.   There were lines wrinkling his face in places that were reserved for old me and women who laid out in the sun for most of their lives.

"Hi Aaron.  So glad of you to join us."

I saw Dorian from the corner of my eye, he was pretending to mind his own business like everyone else in the cafeteria.  

Aaron placed his hands on my chest and I wove an wall of air behind me faster than he could push me backwards.  I was immovable, but I could feel his strength pushing into my rib cage. I could feel them cracking under his massive strength but he stopped as I could feel the air leaving my chest.  He always was a punk.  He always did the same thing.  He can at me with a right hook and I easily ducked underneath it with a leg swipe I assisted with a bar of air and Aaron fell flat on his back.  I had to say something.  I just had to.  "You'd think you'd have learned some different moves in these past ten years Aaron."

I held the large man down with a bar of air and my knee at his throat.  I smiled down at him.  "Do you want to try that again?  I'll give you a free shot."

He snapped his fingers and the others with him came at me.  I released my power and rush of air from my person knocking everyone back who was trying to attack me.  "Please.  You really think I'm going to let you win like I used to?  I don't have Dae'lin holding my strings anymore.  Do you want to try this again?"

I got up off Aaron and when I was several steps away I removed the bar of air.  "Come on.  Do you really want to fight me?  You are just gonna find yourself losing.  I'm sure you know that feeling well - being a loser."

Aaron rushed me like a bull.  He put his head down and I formed a wall of air between us and he rammed his harded headed brain into the air and I watched him bounce off the wall and fall on his back.  He was holding his head like it hurt.  "I can fix that if you like."  I started letting flows of all the elements extend from my fingers and he scrambled up and ran away with the rest of his flunkies.  I watched as they ran away like little cowards that they really were.  

I grabbed what was left of my tray and sat down in front of Dorian.  He looked sad.  "Is this how it always is with you?"

"You mean with Aaron?  Or just my attitude?"

Dorian smiled. "Aaron.  I'm well aware of your attitude."

"Yes.  He's always tried to bully me.  He always gets a few good licks in before I end it.  So I wouldn't get in trouble for starting it."

"He didn't get any in this time.  He wasn't very witty either."

I nodded.  "Never was."

I looked down at my tray and was disappointed that there was hardly anything on it.  I sighed and ate the single carrot and the tiny portion of chicken that had survived the flipping and didn't land on the floor before I had reacted.

"You want some of mine?" Dorian asked.

I shook my head.  "That's alright.  I'll get something later."

"Don't want to share?"  Dorin was faking a pout the big lip and everything.

I reached across and picked up his spoon and took a mouthful of the mashed potatoes and gravy.  It tasted like I'd remembered - not good.  "I'll make you some better that those."

"You cook?"  Dorian asked.

I nodded.  "Only way I can eat what I need to."

"Need to?"  Dorian grinned.  "You sound like a one of those health nuts."

"I suppose I am.  It's an OCPD thing.  Change is anxiety ridden.  I schedule just about everything.  Almost."  I smiled at him.  "It's hard to be spontaneous when you feel the need to have control over everything.  I try and I succeed somedays, but it usually means for the next few days or months I'm gonna be gung-ho about my schedule."

"I'll have to remember that."  Dorian pulled the papers from my laptop bag, helping himself to my personal possessions it seemed.  ## Incomplete Puzzles

I watched him set the laptop up and fire it up without a problem until the password screen flashed on.  He looked to me and waited for me to type it in.  I handed Dorian a card and pointed to a set of words on it.  "All lowercase no spaces."

Dorian shook his head.  "Anyone could guess that."

I grinned.  "It's my laptop not some super secret thing.  The other passwords are more cryptic."

Dorian just shook his head and typed it in.  He found what he was looking for and started a program on my computer I hadn't ever used. It was some annotation software apparently.  Dorian pecked away at the keys and used the track pad like it was a foreigh object.   I watched until I figured out what he was doing.  My stomach rumbled and he pushed his tray in front of me.  "Eat."

I groaned and he looked up from the screen and gave me that look that said I had better or else... I'd have liked to have known what that or else was that gave him that twinkle in his eye.  I ate the mashed potatoes and pulled the skin off the fried chicken and finished what was left of the canned vegetables Dorian had taken.  I tried not to gag on any of it.  I knew my stomach was going to pay for it later.

Dorian turned the computer screen more in my direction and he'd plotted out all the locations of the pattern fragments we'd seen.  They tugged at a memory but I couldn't quite remember where I'd seen them.  They weren't fitting right.

"What's wrong?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know.  They don't fit right.  I know peices are missing but they look inside out.  I don't know how to explain it."

Dorian started up another program from the Venatori servers and started pulling in the drawings I had made on the wall.  He separated each patter and let them float inside the program, it kinda looked like a puzzle to put together.  And that was exactly what it was.  

I pulled the laptop closer to me and started moving peices around.  This was my thing.  I could see what I wanted but I needed to turn peices in a way they just didn't logically move.  Dorian was watching me work and playing footsy with me under the table.  I was happily ignoring him and he was trying to distract me.  A happy game.  But Dorian saw that I'd stopped working and asked, "What's wrong?"

"I can't move the peices like I want."

Dorian took the laptop from me and started manipulating the images.  "How do you want it positioned?"

"Show me how?"  Dorian moved his hands and places his over mine and moved my fingers with a gentle touch.  It wasn't that hard, now that I knew how.  Dorian lifted his fingers and watched me.

"What are you doing?"  He asked.

"Putting together a puzzle with missing peices."  Dorian moved around to my side of the table so it was easier to do this.  His leg pressed against mine and I looked at him.  "You..."  I was lost for words.  

Dorian grinned at me.  "Me?"

I put my hand on his leg and smiled and went back to work.  Thankfully he was on my left so I could still work well with one hand.  His hand patted mine and remained there entwined with my fingers.  

I had the peices where I thought they went but they still looked wrong but I don't know how that could be.  I shook my head.  "Still wrong somehow.  I should know this."

Dorian closed the laptop lid with my fingers still resting on the keyboard.  "Let it marinate for a while. It'll come to you."

I grinned at him.  "Are you still babysitting me?"

Dorian nodded very serious like.  "Yes.  Why?"

"I need to go for a run."  Some of the color left Dorian's face and he frowned.

But he turned it quickly into a joke.  "In these shoes.  I think not."

"I'll be gone an hour or so.  I have some anxiety issues to work out so it might be a little longer."

Dorian looked down at his watch.  "Stop by my apartment when you are done."  He loooked up at me.  "Please, or in two hours I'll send the calvary after you to make sure you are alright."

I nodded. "Alright.  We've done one of the five things on our list.  We can finished the others then?"

Dorian smiled.  "I'll walk you to your destination we can talk about something pressing on my mind."

"Alright."  I started packing up my laptop bag and all the papers we had strewn about on the table.  The cafeteria was nearly empty - it was never completely empty.  The food service might be over but the coffee machines were always on and people worked al hours of the day here only self service items were available now.  I hadn't realized how late it really was.

Dorian walked with me towards the door befor he spoke in a barely audible whispere.   "Who is Adrian?"  I froze.  Dorian stopped and turned and looked at me. "When I was talking with Bonnie at the diner she mentioned him."

I could feel the blood draining from my face and my hands were ice cold.  I took a deep breath and started walking, we needed someplace quiet to talk now.  This wasn't a cooridor talk.  I found an empty room that wasn't used at the time and I showed Dorian in.  "Is something wrong?"

I put up a ward against eavesdropping.  It wasn't a topic I wanted everyone in the world to know.  I shook my head.  I tried to speak but my mouth had suddenly gone dry.  Dorian used it to ask more questions.  "You don't look like you want to talk about it.  Bonnie said that you were broken during/after your abuser until you met Adrian..."

He paused unsure of where he was going after that.  "I will tell you anything.  I just am not sure you are ready for that tidbit of information so soon into whatever we have going on."

"That bad?"  Dorian asked and sat on the corner of the desk one leg stretched on in front of him the other proped up on the table leg.  

I was trying to avoid looking Dorian in the eyes.  "Adiran is one of the few long term relationships I've had."

"So another child abuser?"

I shook my head.  "Adrian didn't abuse me no matter what you think."  I was angry at the fact that he was judging my friend - my salvation.  "If it weren't for Adrian and Margo's work togethere I'd still be that broken little boy.  I'd still be paralyzed under someone's influece unable to say no.  Unable to break the chains that were ingrained in me so young."

There was sympathy on Dorian's face.  I didn't need his pity.  I turned around.  I didn't want to see that look on his face - on anyone's face but definitely not his.  I continued.  "I went to a club, we all did.  Jace, me, Mia, and a few of her friends.  It was all about finding sex.  Not with each other.  I met a man - a werewolf actually.  He was into bondage and I had agreed.  I was underage, but that didn't seem to bother him too much.  I laid out my rules and he agreed.  We didn't know each other's name - it's the way I like it."

I paused to collect my thoughts.  "He pinned me against the wall and I froze.  The moment my shoulders touched I was the zombie like kid that Garrett had created.  It still happens now when I'm not prepared for it.  But he is a therapist, he knew exactly what was happening.  He stopped and started asking me questions.  Things like does this happen often.  Has anyone ever done anything against your will."

"I could only answer in one word sentences, but I was truthful.  I had to be in that state.  He asked me if I was getting help and when I said yes he asked for her number and he immediately called her while I stood still pressed up against the wall like he'd left me.  He explained things and he and Margo argued but I wasn't paying attention.  He told me when he hung up that he'd help me - for a fee."

"I only nodded but he released me from my holding.  He told me.  'No one should have that over your'.  He introduced himself as Adrian Lupita and we got started right away.  He taught me the safe words - taught me how to say no when I lost control due to fear.  He helped me."

I looked up expecting to see the wall and not Dorian, but there he was standing in front of me, whiping away a tear that had fallen and was sliding down my cheek.  He was gentle and careful not to make more of a mess.  He whispered, "Did you sleep with him?"

I nodded.  "A couple times.  But it wasn't like that.  And it wasn't until I had full control of my own self.  He showed me things."

"Things?"


I took a deep breath.  "How to be a dominate or a submissive depending on who I was with without giving up complete control to the other.  He showed me sex didn't have to hurt to be pleasurable."  I was looking at Dorian's deep blue eyes when I finished.  "He taught me it's okay to be weak sometimes."

Dorian stared at me.  "Nox..."  He wrapped his arms around me.  He pittied me.  He pittied my childhood.  I didn't return the warm gesture.  I wanted to but it was pity that promptd it.  I hated being pittied.

Dorian unwound his arms from me with a frown, "What's wrong?"

"You pity me."  I said it with so much venom Dorian flinched.

"It's a natural reaction to a sad upbringing.  I'm sorry you can see that.  It doesn't change anything."

"Nothing?  How could it not?  According to you I've been raped.  I've had sexual encounters you can't even imagine because it was what I thought love was.  It was how I felt close to someone without getting emotionally hurt.  How does that not affect anything?"

Dorian looked down at his feet.  "I can't imagine your life before.  Honestly Nox, it pisses me off that someone - anyone - treated you like this. Could treat anyone like this.  Someone should have been watching you - looking out for you."

"What could they do Dorian?  I had that.  I snuck out behind their back to do the things I wanted.  I was the one doing wrong because it felt good.  I fucked up my life.  Now I get to deal with it."

"It still changes nothing.  Without those experiences you wouldn't be who you are.  There is no point in worrying about the past.  Worrying whether or not you will fall back into those comforting memories.  If you do you do and we'll deal with it.  But this person right here."  He grabbed my shoulders.  "This person is a good man.  Yes I feel bad about your upbringing.  But I'm smart enough to realize that it's what shaped you.  And you yourself said that this was new.  I'm new to you.  That means you don't want what you had before you."  He pulled me close to him, his forehead pressed against mine.  "I'm okay with that."  

I blinked at him unable to say anything.  My anger and memories were fadng being this close to his calm center.  The scent of vanilla and cinamon permated the air around Dorian and I could feel muscles losen that I hadn't known were tight.  I kissed Dorian.  My breath quickened with each beat of my racing heart.  My body ached for him.  Ached for his fingers against my skin.  But Dorian pulled away first with a smile, "You were going for a run?"

I nodded.  "I should."

Dorian nodded. "I'm not sorry I asked Nox.  I'm concerned but not about your past."

"What are you worried about?"

Dorian took my arm and started walking towards the door.  "Things you don't need to worry about Nox.  It's not you that concerns me.  It's myself."

I stopped and Dorian turned to look back at me.  "Don't hide from me Dorian.  I won't lie to you, or hide from you.  I will answer anything you need to know.  Tell you everything.  I can't deal with games and new feelings.  I can't."

Dorian nodded and took a step towards me and took my arm again and we left the room before he continued.  "I'm worried I'm not enough for you.  I have no where near the experiences you do."

I laughed.  "You think any of that matters to me?"  I stopped Dorian pushed him up against the wall and pressed my body against him.  I could feel his warmth and my only thought was to want to have him naked under my hands.  I leaned in and whispered in his ear.  "No one.  And I mean no one has ever made me feel the way you make me feel.  I'm scared and excited at the same time. I think about kissing you and my knees go weak.  The thought that you might want me makes my heart soar."

Dorian asked, "Might?  There is no might in this equation Nox."

I smiled.  "You are enough Dorian.  Always enough. More than enough."

He kissed me in the hallway. It was long and passionate and I know I felt at least one person brush my back as they hurried past us.  We pulled apart breathless and smiling and started back down the path we were to the gym holding hands.  The silence wasn't awkward.  The looks we received made Dorian tense until they were behind us.  No one said anything.  No one stopped us to tell us how wrong this was.  Men with men didn't happen often in the Venatori but it did happen - ironically women with women happened more often.  But I felt happy - happier than I had ever felt in my life.
## Accidents Happen

We went the long way to the gym.  I'm not sure if Dorian was prolonging it or if he was just letting me wander, but it doesn't really matter.  I stopped at the door to the gym and stepped aside as someone was exiting.  Dorian kissed me good-bye there were no words just the soft press of his lips and his teeth biting softly into my lip before he parted with a wink.  "Remember stop by when you are done."

I nodded and watched as Dorian walked away from me to go do whatever it was he did.  I entered the gym and changed quickly and left down the stairs outside into the cool New York air.  A storm was brewing I could feel it on my skin, and the sky looked angry in the dim light of dusk.

I ran for about an hour.  It felt good to be back in New York City doing the things I did.  It was a releif to find peace in my surroundings. Not that nature wasn't peaceful, this was just home.  I was a mess more than ever though.  Around every corner I thought I saw Garrett.

I focused on the memory of Dorian, how he smelled, how he felt, his lips against mine.  By the time I was back in the gym hitting the showers my mind was preocuppied with seeing Dorian again.  So preoccupied I didn't notice the veil I didn't put up and a pair of teenage boys were staring at the scars on my back.  Soon as I turned around they bolted out the door knocking over a bucket of mops and brooms in the corner.

I sighed and turned off the water and wrapped my towel around me and headed for the locker I was using.  I sat down and started rifling through my bag of things to find something comfortable to wear I was tired of the monkey suit.  I found another pair of shorts and a semi-decent t-shirt.  It at least didn't say anything inappropriate, and it matched with the shorts, both a dark shade of red.  The shirt read "I'd hit that" with a picture of a pinanta underneath it.  

A voice spoke behind me as I mused about the shirt.  "I'd hit that?  Really?  You haven't grown up at all."

I didn't turn to see my father standing next to an opened locker pulling a t-shirt over his head.  "Nope I have not."

He sat down next to me but faced the other way and pulled on his sneakers.  "Those scars?  You want to talk about them.  They aren't career related."

"No I don't actually."

Kai put his hand on my shoulder as he stood up, there was only a little uncomfortalbe weight added to my body as he stood.  "If you do.  I'd love to hear the story.  Beat the shit that hurt you."

I stood up and pulled my shirt over my head and my boxers and shorts on before I said anything as I turned to face my father.  "You care now?"  It sounded sharp and bitter.  It was rude.  I closed my eyes and swallowed my pride.  "I'm sorry.  That was uncalled for.  You didn't know."

"I would have then and I do now.  Son, we are too alike that's why we butt heads.  You are more like me than any of my other children and it's frightening because it comes from the same upbringing.  Don't get lost in the anger."  He didn't stay any long as he headed off into the depths of the gym to hunt down whatever workout he was going to do.  

I sighed and finsihed dressing and packing up my things.  I was about to head to the stairs when I heard the fire alarm go off.  It squelched five times with a short pause then gave the location.  I headed towards the archives at least that's what I thought it said.  Why would anyone be bending in the archives?  And then I thought about it - another bomb...

I took the stairs three at a time and by the time I reached the right level i was sweating and breathing heavy from the added exersion.  There was a crowd milling around in every cooridor.  I had to talk my way through things with my back pack slung over my shoulder.  My father was already up here and he was stepping up to block my passage.  "No."

"No?"

Kai pushed me back they way I'd come.  "I said No."

"Why the fuck not? I can help." I was bristling with anger I could feel the blood rushing through my body hotter than when he'd interrupted me before.

"Nox, just no."

"Let me pass Kai." 

I tried to shove my way through when one of the medics grabbed my wrist.  "I need him."  He lead me around the corner. "Whatever you did last time, I need you to do it again."

I blinked at him and then I remembered him, he was one of those who'd watched me heal Nick.  I nodded, "Alright."  I turned to look a the broken body in front of me and I froze.  Dorian lay on the gurny in front of me, 3/4 of his body was burnt, his face, the pretty clothes were all char and I could clearly see the tattoo on his chest through it.  The medic pushed me, "Come on man, we got another one."

I blinked again and grabbed Dorian's hand.  "I got you.""  I let my powers flow through me into him.  I wove patterns of all the elements and let them settle over his whole body as I fed his body the strength he needed to heal himself.

I could see the wounds knitting closed as I did.  I could feel the weakening it was doing to my body.  "Where is the second one?  Bring them here.  I'll not be strong enough later."

The medics listened and Nox saw what was a pretty woman lying on another gurny the resemblence to Dorian was uncanny.  Fuck!  I held her hand and I fed her the same energy.  I split the pattern two ways.  I could feel my own energy levels depleting.  I could feel my legs giving way and I fell to my knees.  I heard a voice behind me, "You need to stop."  I shook my head.  No there was still too much damage.

I gave them both everything I had and darkness overcame me only moments later.

* * *

I tried to open my eyes but they still felt heavy, my whole body felt heavy.  There was a faint scent of vanilla and cinamon lingering in the air.  I rested in the comfort of the smell until I felt the weight lifting.  I tried to sit up and open my eyes at the same time, but I couldn't move.  That was when I noticed hands where pressing medown.  Voices were speaking, "Hold him down.  We have to get the needle in."

It was a gut reaction - needles were one of my biggest fears and I hadn't meant to but I expanded my presense and pushed people away with a gust of hard air.  There were no hands on me anymore.  There was buzzers going off all over and my head started to pound.

A woman, a voice I barely recognized was touching my arm.  "It's okay Nox.  Calm down.  We need you to calm down."  I sat up unhindered this time and blinked at everyone in the room.  I didn't recognize anyone.  

"What's going on?"

The same woman touching me looked up at me from her small stature and smiled.  "You passed out.  We need to give you nourishment."

"I'm awake now so you don't need to put an IV in my arm."

She nodded, "Yes we do.  Please?"

"No".  It came out much louder than I had intended.  Someone cleared their throat in the doorway and I looked up to see Dorian dressed in a hospital gown and dressings all over the place.  Fuck!  The memories flooded back.  I remember seeing Dorian burnt and dying - his mother too.

Another nurse was abruptly upon Dorian before he could say anything as we looked at each other.  "Mr. Vega, go back to bed he's fine.  See he's awake now."

He smiled and swated the woman away as he hobbled towards me with an IV bag hanging from a rolling pole.  I frowned.  "You okay?"

He nodded.  "Thanks to you - yes, I'll be fine.  No scars I'm told."

I breathed a sigh of releif, "And the woman?"

Dorian smiled.  "My mother will be fine too.  But you need to let them do this.  Nox, you passed out, your energy is turning in on itself I can see it.  You need more energy than you can consome the normal way.  Please."

I shook my head.  "No fucking way they are sticking me with a needle."

Dorian took my left arm and held it under his and pressed his body against me.  "I will distract him while you do this."

"That's not going to work ..."  I didn't get his name out before he was kissing me.  And not just any kiss, the aggression he showed was primal, there was so much more to the kiss than just a distraction.  The want, the need, the fear... He was worried for me.  I pulled back and they chose that moment to prick my skin with that fucking needle.  My heart raced, my body started to shake and Dorian leaned in again and pulled me into his embrace.
"Shhhh...."  He whispered between breaths and kissing.  

Someone patted my arm and Dorian pulled away.  "Better.  Lay down and behave.  I'll be right here.  You need rest."

I sighed and listened to him.  I did as he instructed trying my best not to look at my arm.  Before Dorian laid in the bed next to him he draped the sheet over my arm, "Better?"

I nodded.  I stared at him from across the way.  His body looked fine, but his eyes said he hurt.  Burns always hurt.  I remebered my own.  Nurses crossed our line of sight and were giving us the look.  But I didn't care I looked at Dorian - watched him.  I wanted nothing more than to soothe his pain.  But he watched me with the same intense gaze until we were left alone in the room with the beeping monitors.

Dorian smiled.  "You have a habit of saving my life, you know that?"

"It's worth it."  I grinned at him.  I was feeling sleepy.  

Dorian started humming softlyand I started to sink deeper into sleep.  I started to ask what they did to me but I was gone before the first word hit my mouth, but I could hear the soft melody I had hummed to Dorian earlier and between that and the soft scent of vanilla and cinaomon I drifted off into a near dreamless sleep.
## All The Peices

I didn't wake from a normal dream.  I was breathing hard and my heart was racing but in a good way and I well... you don't need to hear that.  I opened my eyes and found that I was a lone in the room.  I didn't know how long I had slept or what they'd given me to do so.  I sat up and found the IV still in my arm that had caused me to pass out so easily.  I pulled the needle from my arm in a less than ceremonious way. The liquid oozed out and I had to put pressure on the hole in my arm before it quickly closes off.  At least that was a good thing, I was kinda healing.  

Alarms went off in my room and nurses came running but they slowed down once they saw me disconnecting the wires from my body.  "I'm leaving now."

I put my foot down on the floor and stood up but my knees gave way underneath me but a quick nurse caught me and helped me back to sit on the bed.  "No you aren't."

Dorian chose that moment to walk in, he was standing a fresh suit, his hair was neatly done and I could smell the freshly applied after shave that covered up the cinamon and vanilla.  I smiled at him but he stood in the door waiting on the nurses to leave.  Which they didn't until I was lying back down in the bed.  When he walked in he had a bag of food I couldn't make out the different smells as he pulled the bed side table over the bed and started laying out a table setting worthy of the finest restauarant.  "I figured you'd want real food."

I raised an eye brow at him, I wasn't sure if what he called real food and what I did quallified as the same thing.  The food was still hot, he'd just gone to get it.  He started opening containers as he sat down on the edge of the bed facing me on the otherside of the flimsy table.  "They say you need to stay here another couple of days, but if you eat, you can keep that out of your arm.  But you need to keep fueling the repair of your energy."

I grinned at him.  "I can share yours."

He looked up down at me to see if I was joking which I wasn't.  "How so?"

"It's only a theory.  But you can fuel my body as I did your's to heal."

Dorian shook his head, "I'm not Cesari."

"You shouldn't have to be.  As long as you can think and weave the patterns fast enough.  You'll look like Cesari to outsiders but it would be individual threads at one time.  But like I said it's just a theory."

Dorian asked, "And what would this theory entail to test?"

"A willing participant, a person who can touch all four elements preferrably someone who can remember the sequence quickly and who has the reflexes to preform them quickly.  I mean it's a simple weave, but it needs to be maintained for severl minutes in order for there to be enough to help my body heal itself faster."

I laughed.  "You'd think I was the one that was blown up."

Dorian didn't laugh.  I frowned.  "I'm sorry.  How is your mother?"

Dorian patted my hand.  "She is doing excellent thanks to you.  There were no major burns left to heal only first degree for both of us and no internal injuries.  Thank you."

I smiled up at him and my stomach growled.  Dorian finished plating the food.  "After you eat you can show me.  I will try.  It won't hurt you if it goes badly will it?"

"The weaves are harmless to my knowledge so we should be good."

Dorian pulled a few more things out of the corner while I dug into the food he'd placed carefully in front of me.  Chicken catetori piled high with vegetables in a lemon garlic sauce.  "Victor's?" I asked as I stuffed another peice of food in my mouth.

"Yes."  Dorian said as he dropped a bag on my bed.  "He said it has healing powers."

I grinned at him and nodded.  "It does."  I moaned softly through bites. "My god it's good."

Dorian laughed.  "I will be sure to tell Victor."

He pulled out my laptop, my paper work and a few other file folders I hadn't seen before. On one of those tabs I saw Levi Hughes written on it.  I looked up at Dorian, "Did we find Levi?"

Dorian nodded.  "Yes.  He had gone to his room. He's been placed in Dae'lin's watchful care until you are better.  If she could handle you, she can handle him."

"What are the other files?"

Dorian placed a red one on my laptop, "This is the forensics for the first scene.  The blue one is the one two days ago."

"Wait - two days?  I've been sleeping for two days?"

Dorian nodded.  "Yeah.  Did no one tell you?"

I sighed.  "Have there been any other bombings?"

Dorian shook his head.   "No."  But he didn't sound convinced they had blown over.  Dorian continued, "The green folder is the photo footage we took but you already have on your laptop.  The yellow is the second scene.  We had no one as skilled as you or I to do the reconstruction so I don't expect we'll get the same results but I figured it was something you could do lying in bed."

He stood up and straighted his cuffs and leaned over and kissed me softly.  He tasted like toothpaste still and the pepermint didn't quite go so well with my food. But I didn't care I enjoyed the feel of him against me.  I grabbed his tie and pulled him closer and he obliged me a little before he pulled away breathless and straightening the golden tie against his stark white shirt.  "I have to go to work.  I'll be back later with more food.  I think Bonnie wants to send a whole pie your way."

I smiled.  "Alright."  I started to reach for his tie but thought better of it and simply asked, "Another kiss before you leave?  Please?"  I sounded pathetic even to my own ear, but Dorian only chuckled.

He leaned in and kissed me tenderly on the cheek and when I turned to meet his lips he pulled away.  I shook my head, "Fine be that way."

Dorian pressed his lips against mine hard and bit my bottom lip before he pulled away.  "Now I have to go to work."

I grinned at him.  "Thank you. Sorry I rumbled your tie."

He smiled and straightened it again.  "No harm, no foul.  I will see you later Nox."  Dorian turned around and walked out of my hospital room door and a gaggle of nurses at the station outside my room watched him walk off down the hall.  

I grinned and yelled at them, "He's mine!"

They all turned and looked at me and then scattered in small groups heading back tot heir own routes.  Dorian was garnering a lot of attention today. I wondered if he was getting as many proposition as I was - probably more, I thought to myself idly as I finished what was left of the food he'd brought me.  I hadn't realized most of it was gone.  Had I finished it that quickly.  My stomach rumbled and I hit the call button.

A small blonde waltz into my room with a questioning look on her face, "Yes?"

"When is breakfast served around here?"  I asked.

"You **just** ate." She sounded surprised.

"Yeah.  I am feeding a supernatural energy that kinda made me pass out because I overused it.  It's like feeding an army."

She asked, "Has it happened before?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I've never drained myself before.  I've never had cause to delepte my resources before."

"You shouldn't do that."

"Well duh!  I see that now.  How was I supposed to know that splitting my reserves would do that?"

She rolled her eyes at me.  "If I see you using your ability at all while you are in here I will gut you myself - pretty face or not?"

"Pretty face?  I do hope you are talking about Dorian and not me."

She winked at me.  "Not that he'd ever notice anyway with you around."

I grinned, "He'd not notice you like that anyway, Duckling.  He's all men all the time.  Unlike my grand self."

"I heard you were a cocky one."  She left the room and headed down the hall the way Dorian had gone and my stomach rumbled again.  I hoped she was successful in finding food.  As I started looking at the last scene that was sitting on top of my laptop just waiting for me to put the puzzle together.

Dorian had already put the images in that manipulation program we use earlier - two days earlier.  I was going to take a few days to adjust to the missed days.  I started going through the images and placing the peices again.  It wasn't as hard as the first time but the patterns weren't drawn very well.  But I worked the best I could with what I had.

The nurse who was in my room before set a tray of food down on my table and walked away.  I yelled after her.  "And if this isn't enough?"

She turned with a bright smile.  "We'll bring you more.  Drink plenty of water as well."

I nodded, "Always do."

There were three bottles of water on the tray and a lot of fried food. I sighed.  I pressed the call button again.  She showed back up and I smiled pushing the tray away.  "This will make me sick."  I asked, "Can I have my phone?  I'll just order something."

She shook her phone.  "No, I can't let you order food to be delivered.  Your family can bring you food, but ..."  

And as if I had summoned him Jace showed up at my door bearing bags of food.  The pretty blonde nurse turned and smiled, "It seems your family knows you well."

Jace laughed, "You brought him fried chicken and french fries."  Jace picked up a french frie and popped it in his mouth, "Still hot too.  Darling, don't feed him junk.  Protein and vegetables - a little grains and unless it's pasta or fancy smancy bread he won't eat it." Jace grinned, "Just a tidbit."

He stepped inside and placed two paper bags on my table and moved the trahe other one in the room and started eating from it.  "Unless of course you are bringing food to everyone else who might be visiting him.  Then most of us will eat whatever it is."  He rolled his eyes.  "The man is too picky for his own good.  Doesn't know what's good and what's not."  Jace bit into the fried chicken leg and juices ran down his chin.

I rolled my eyes.  "Thanks Jace."  Whatever was in the bag smelled wonderful.  "Mia make it?"

"No I did.  Of course she did.  She figured you were awake now, and that needle in your arm wasn't going to stay in long so she's been cooking for four of you since she found out you had woken up."

I didn't hesitate to open up the bag and find all the glorious smells pushing past my nose.  Mia could cook.  Not as good as me, but she was damn fine.  I didn't care what I pulled out first I ate whatever it was and it was delicious.  The nurse looked at me like I was some alien or something shaking her head as she left muttering something about manners.  So what, I was eating with my fingers.

Jace looked at the laptop screen and frowned.  "You aren't your puzzles."

I only smiled at him and continued eating.  "So.  Dorian?"  There was that certain lit to his voice that implied he wanted details.  

I finished chewing the asapargus I was downing.  "I don't kiss and tell, you know that."

He stuck his tongue out at me.  "Awe, come on.  He's a good lay, the least you could do is share some of the details."

"I haven't slept with him yet, Jace.  There's been like one day where I was seeing him."

Jace stared at me unblinking, "Seriously?  Why the fuck not.  You've been pining over him since the Academy."

"I have not been pining.  We came close.  But I carded him."

"Jeez Nox, what he do?"

"Nothing wrong.  Nothing he wouldn't know not to do."

Jace frowned, "You broke your own rules, how unlike you."

I sighed.  "I wasn't intending to go anywhere with him at the time, it just happened.  His hand, his mouth..."  I could replay everything in my head but my stomach growled and I started the next bowl.

"Damn it boy.  Mia's gonna be cooking for a month if you are eating like this."

"If they let me out of here I can feed myself."

Jace sighed.  "From what I hear they ain't letting you out soon."

I continued eating the homemade mushu pork with my fingers and stared at the laptop screen.  Something clicked and I set the food down and licked my fingers clean.  My fingers were still sticky but the keyboard would just have to be cleaned later.  I moved the peices of the bad drawing around and saw it formed the same general shape as the last one.  It nagged at me, but this one was different it was inverted.

Jace had moved to sit next to me and was watching me manipulate things.  I swapped out the new one for the old one and tried to invert the drawings I had made.  Jace whistled.  "You've only gotten better.  I haven't seen your stuff for a while."

I just nodded as I tried to make the program do what I wanted.  I sighed in fustration, I wanted to push the table away from me in anger but that would do little go so I flung a small fireball at the wall.  No sensors went off and there was only a small spattering of char on the wall.

Jace asked, "What's wrong?  Can I help?"

"I need to invert the peice, it's drawn backwards.  Does that make sense.  I don't know this program well enough."

Jace grinned.  "You never were terribly handy when it came to figure the easy stuff out.  Give you a fucking puzzle with a billion peices and you'd have it done in an hour.  Finding your socks that were under your bed, that took days."

I stuck my tongue out at Jace and picked up my food again.  Jace reached into the bag and handed me a fork.  "There are things called forks.  You eat with them.  Grow up man.  You are fucking a man who likes everything in order."

I sighed.  "I've not fucked him yet Jace."  I heard the anger in my voice and Jace turned to look at me.

"Dude, chill.  I get it.  Just friends."

I sighed, "Sorry.  It's not just friends either."

"What you falling in love with him?"  I could hear the joke in his voice but when I didn't answer him with a revernt denial he turned to look at me, "You're joking, right?"

I shrugged.  "I came back to do just that didn't I?"

"Yeah but with Dorian Vega.  Man you can't start a family with another guy. At least not easily.  He's good in bed Nox.  But he ain't that good.  Not that special to give up your dreams for."

"Who said I had to give up my dreams?  Do you know how many women are throwing themsleves at me?  I already have sex planned with one.  And she doesn't want the kid."

Jace looked at me with astonishment in his eyes.  "You are one lucky S.O.B."

I shrugged and Jace turned the laptop back around to face me.  "That it?"

I nodded, "Fuck me!"

Jace laughed, "Don't mind if I do."

I shook my head.  "I gotta go find someone."## The Chase

Jace was looking at me with curiousity but he didn't try to stop me when I tried to get up out of the bed I was staying in.  I could feel the weakness in my knees but I managed to stand without too much wobbling.  Jace never once attempted to stop me.  This time no buzzing went off.  I was not connected to any monitors as long as I ate they didn't care about me.

I found my bag put in a corner.  It had been neatly packed - Dorian must have gone through it.  I found my phone lying on top of the clothes inside the bag.  I sat quickly dialed a number and set it to speaker phone.  I didn't care what I was wearing, I pulled on the top pair of jeans and a t-shirt as the phone was picked up.  "Nox?"

"Dorian, I know who it is."

Dorian's voice came over the phone but it still sounded surprised. "Know who what is?"

"The one who hurt you."  My voice was filled with venom even I knew that I didn't have.  That's when I noticed Jace was standing beside me waiting.

I stood up and tried to walk around him.  "Nox, someone else can handle this.  Just let me call your dad, he's been working the case while you've been in here."

"Jace, get out of my way."  

Dorian spoke quickly. "Jason do not let him leave.  I'll be right there to help."  And then the line went dead.  I couldn't imagine Dorian sprinting his way here no matter the cause but I had to be gone before he got here.  I knew he'd make me stay and he'd use every tool in his aresenal.  But he only needed to ask me and I would...  What did that mean?  

I pushed the curious thoughts away as I took another step to get around Jace but he moved to interept me.  "Jace, move or I will move you.  I don't want to hurt you."

"I know that.  But you can't go running off half cocked after whoever this person is because you aren't in your right mind.

"Jason.  Move!"  It was his last warning.

He stood his ground.   I watched him make ready for anything I could do to him.  He thought I would use magic, my ability.  He was faster and stronger than I was, but Jason Hill knew me better than any person ever.  He knew my first instinct, so I didn't go with it.  I rushed past him in a spurt of energy that I barely knew I had.  He looked at me with agony in his eyes as he toppled over out of surprise and worry.  I could see both emotions etched clearly on his face when I turned back to see him before walking out the door.

He could have caught me, but I threw up a wall of air in the doorway and he stood staring after me.  He didn't even bother trying to get out. 

I didn't take the stairs. Dorian knew I would avoide them, so the elevator it was.  I headed for the Dorimitory floors.  My anger fueled me, the fear slide around the anger not to bother my determination.  I would find Levi, and he would be put to justice.  I had every right to hunt him down and kill him.  Venatori law was Venatori law and I was a hunter, it was my job to put him down.  But even though he'd hurt Dorian I knew I coldn't just do that.  He was just a kid...

I walked through the elevator doors to the boy's dorms and found Mr. Larry sitting at his usual desk.  I could speak to him for hours about anyhing and everything when I was a child, but today he looked up at me and I only had one question.  "Where is Levi Hughes?"

"In his room."  Mr Larry said flatly.  "I'll go get him."

I shook my head.  "Just tell me where it is I'll get him myself."

"What's this all about Nox?"  he asked me standing up to block my way.

"He's marked."

The shock of what I had said registered.  "He's only a child.  Surely he didn't do anything that bad."

I just looked at him.  "Tell me where he is."

"Of course, Venatori."  He handed me a slip of paper with his room number on it with a note that said, "Don't kill him. please."

I looked at Mr. Larry.  "Apparently you know nothing of the man I became."  I didn't wait for his response as I headed for the door to the wing Levi's room was on.  I turned he corner and I saw Levi standing in his door talking with Garrett.  I froze in mid step.

Garrett left the other direction and Levi went into his room and neither of them noticed my frozen self standing in the hall.  I don't know how long I stood there willing myself to move.  The fury had been replaced with fear.  Why was Garrett talking with Levi?  Where they working together?

I started moving.  I had to figure this out.  Levi had to answer for his crimes but I would no be the one to kill him.  I was about to knock on the door when I heard the building go into lock down.  The lights went dim and the halls turned a sickly shade of red.  All the electronic doors released and would lock the moment they closed until someone in security shut them down.  I didn't have time to wonder what was going on before Levi opened his door and ran straight into me knocking me around.  

He stumbled and picked himself up and started running towards the stairs.  I didn't know why he was running he couldn't know why I was here unless he suspected...  Why had Garrett been here.

I ran after him.  The electroic doors to the stair well had recently been opened or theyd have been locked shut.  But I missed them, so I cut through the lock with a fine thread of fire.  I heard footstes racing up.  I followed.  I was weaker than I should be.

I could feel my knees straining with the effort of taking the stairs three at a time but I was gaining on him.  Levi was trying each door at every landing but nothing would budge.  He'd catch sight of me and start moving again.  He never even thought to use his gift.   How unfortunate or him.  

Three flightes before the roof Levi stopped checking doors and kept running.  What did he think he was going to do ... jump.

I had given him the key out.  I increased my pace.  He was full Venatori and faster than I was, and he was already out on the roof, the door was busted beyond repair, he'd finally decided his power was a worthy tool to use.  He stood by the edge of the room looking over.

I yelled over the howling wind that threatened to bring rain down upon us.  "Levi stop!"

He turned around and looked at me.  He was smiling and started walking back towards me.  "It had to be you.  You know you won't stop us.  The Venatori will fall."

Stupid villians always spouting their egotistical plans.  I let him continue speaking.  "I didn't kill the head of the snake, but someone else will.  But you won't catch me.  You are a poor excuse for a Venatori - half human.  They should have killed you when you were born."

Levi turned and ran towards the edge.  I followed.  He jumped and soared over the edge tucking himself into a ball to increase speed.  But he didn't spread any elements, he plummeted down faster than I'd ever dared.  I thought as quickly as I could and I sped down in his direction the same way, softening the ground as I did, I had wings of air ready for the moment I caught the stupid boy.  

When my body rammed into his I finished the pattern but there was only a few more seconds of falling before we rammed our selves into the ground - no matter how soft it was it was going to hurt like hell.  I thickened my wings and tried to slow us further but it wasn't enough.  I felt my body shatter on impact and then there was nothing but darkness...# Part II: Terror

## Rise and Fall of Nightmares

There was only darkness at first.  And then the pain.  The bone shattering, blood boiling pain radiating through every cell in my body.  Clarity never resolved, everything remained black and pain filled.  Seconds, minutes, days of nothing but soul crushing pain waved through my body.  And then clarity came - a voice in my head that said, "You are mine."

The red eyes of my demons tormmented me from that moment out.  Unable to move, unable to breathe or see anything else.  The demon rode the waves of pain and was the only illumination in the darkness.  Weeks?  I'd lost track of any amount of time.  I watched the demon's eyes get clearer, watched as the tentacles grew shape and formed and raked my body in places it never had.  The pain made me want to scream out but my mouth was dry and raw and no sound escaped my throat.

The soft scent of vanilla followed quickly by cinamon rode in on currents of the winds in my mind.  Images drifted in my head along with the floating red eyes and tentacles.  A man with deep blue eyes, his hands touching my face - a soft kiss and my mind went blank.  There was nothing but the soft presence in my soul.  

But it too was replaced by the pain and darkness.  Months?  Years?  There was nothing but pain, the demon crept back in, making hmself known again.  "Mine," it claimed in a rasping voice that tore through my head like a sledgehammer.  "Mine!"

The pain became normal.  The pain waxed and waned on the currents of the air.  For every up there was a down and for every in an out.  It pulsed in me like my heart beat.  

And then when I thought the pain had become nothing more than a dull ache I saw a light. The light called to me, I blinked and my eyes were stunned by the light - it was too bright.  I covered my eyes with my hand, my skin felt cold and clammy and there were wires restricting my movment.  My heart started to race.  Panic flooded my body and I tried to sit up but pain lanced through my body.  Instruments of fleshy heat touched my arms holdng me down.  Sounds like words never touched my ears.  I wanted to scream but I couldn't.

A soft rush under my skin and then there was darkness.  And in the darkness the demon returned.  "It's about time."  And the demon shown his face, his eyes no longer read.  The world had solidified in my mind and I knew the man in front of me.  He worse a smile that I hated, his eyes gleamed with a dark lust.  He touched my skin and I felt the hfire burn my skin.  

My eyes shot open and I was looking up at the man.  He smiled down at me and laughed.  "You are mine!"

I couldn't speak, I couldn't think as I drifted back into nothingness.  The dull ache of pain left and was comforted by the soft touch against my hand.  A familiar voice spoke to me but the words didn't reach me.  I moved towards the voice.  I tried to open my eyes but the tender touch covered them.  "Don't move, Nox."

I grabbed the wrist holding my eyes close and tried to push it away.  But it was unmovable. The grip moved from gently touching me to pinning my wrists above my head.  I felt a hot breath against my neck as the voice whispered in my ear.  "Nox.  It's okay don't move.  Keep your eyes closed and don't move and I'll let you go.  They will restrain you if they come in here and you are like this.  Lie still. Please."

I did as I was instructed unsure of why I complied.  Lips brushed my ear in a gentle kiss.  "Good.  Listen to me."

I relaxed more and I felt the presense leave.  I heard a chair scraping against the floor and smelled vanilla and cinamon.  I knew it meant something but my brain was foggy and I was barely managing the little control I had.  "You've been hurt badly."  I felt his hand touch mine.  It was warm and soft in my hand.  It hurt to move.  I groaned.  The sound of my own voice sounded foreign - strained.

"Shhhh... Don't move."  I tried to open my eyes, but his hand touched my eyes.  "Just stay still, quiet and don't open your eyes.  Please?  Let me talk."  His hand slid down my face and caressed it I leaned my head into it.  I heard him smile.  "Touch, is what you want?  I can do that.  Just no more moving.  You jumped off the roof Nox.  You almost died.  You broken nearly every bone in your body. They almost lost you a few times, but your body started rapidly healing, and then stopped and would start again.  You've been trashing around and making things worse."

"You told me I could share my energy to help before.  You never showed me how."  He sounded sad.

A wave of images flahsed through my mind.  Sitting in a hospital room flirtig with Dorian.  Dorian... I thought about the patterns in my head that I had wanted to show Dorian and I wove them weakly from memory.  I heard Dorian gasp as saw what I was doing.  He put his hand on my chest and tried to make me stop.  "Nox.  Stop.  You are too weak."

I tried to speak but my voice only cracked.  I kept trying.  "You. to help."

I could feel my energy depleting.  I felt the fog settle over my mind as I drifted yet again off into oblivion.

There was pain, worse than before but the demon didn't come, there was only he soft scent of vanilla and cinamon and images of Dorian floating through my mind.  His deep blue eyes staring back at me.  

I opened my eyes, the room was dim and I could hear the soft beeping of machines nearby. My mouth felt dry and I was hungry.  I moved and it hurt but I found the nurse call button and touched it.  There were no voices from the little speaker, but the door to my room opened and she walked over slowly.  "Nox?"

I tried to speak but only one word came out audible. "Hungry."

She smiled at me and laughed.  "Okay.  But it's a liquid diet. "  She picked up a cup and dropped a few ice chips in my mouth, "This should help."

And it did a little.  I tried to sit up and she put her hand on my bare chest, "Stay still I'll raise the bed and then I'll let your doctor know you are awake."

"Dorian?"

She laughed.  "I sent him home to sleep about an hour ago.  After you started improving, I told him he had to sleep in a proper bed."  She smiled.  "I was surprised he left."

I smiled.  "Can I have my phone?"

She shook her head.  "No sorry.  I will call him and tell him you are awake. But your Doctor is first."

I sighed.  "Do I have to keep this thing in my arm?"

"You at least haven't ripped it out yet.  But yes you do.  Let the doctor see you first."

I sighed, "You are luck it hurts to move.  I want to see Dorian."

"He'll be here when he gets here.  You had other visitors too."  

I shrugged.  "Who wouldn't want to come stare at me while I sleep."  

She smiled.  And I asked, "I didn't catch your name last time."

"Shannon."  She smiled brightly, "And you never asked before."

"That is completely my bad."  I started coughing.  

Ana handed me a cup of ice, "No more talking.  No moving.  No nothing until the doctor sees you."  She grinned at me, "Or I won't call Mr. Vega."

I mimed the motion of zipping my lips with a smile and sucked on the ice chips until a familiar face was standing in my doorway. 

Ana stepped in and said, "The first of many doctors who you have to see today.  Behave, or I will keep my promise."

I rolled my eyes and then pointed out my window then stuck my tongue out at her.  Dorian was standing in the hallway leaning against the nurses station speaking to another nurse there, a brunette with a purple streak in her hair that I was pretty sure I knew but at the moment I couldn't place her.  Ana closed the blinds and stuck her tongue out at me and I grinned.  Well played.

Margo closed the door after Ana left.  "How are you feeling Nox?"

"I hurt - everywhere."

Margo sat down in the chair beside the bed.  "That happens when you break every bone in your body."

"Why are you here?"  I asked.

"Evaluating your mental state."

"So they think I jumped to kill myself?"  I sighed.  It wasn't the first time that they'd tried to keep me from the roof by claiming I was trying to kill myself.

"That's their angle."  But Margo didn't sound convinced.

"I'm not entirely sure they are wrong, Nox."

"Seriously?  You think I'd kill myself?"

Margo sighed. "It's not like you've not tried in the past."

"I was seven."

"And again at 14."

I was angry.  "I didn't try to kill myself when I was 14.  It was a fucking accident.  I thought you beleived me when I told you that."

Margo sighed.  "I reserved judgment Nox.  You jumped from the building and you almost killed yourself, landing on the cement sidewalk instead of the grass you claimed to be aiming for."

"I was messing around.  I was playing with patterns.  I only got bumps and bruises and broken arm from the bad landing."

"And this time?"  Margo asked.  "Were you saving the boy like Dorian?"

I shook my head and it hurt.  "No.  He jumped I was trying to catch him.  He was the one setting off bombs."

"And you told no one.  No one knows what you and that boy were doing."

"I told Dorian.  I called him.  Told him I knew who it was.  Who had hurt him.  Jace was there."

Margo nodded.  "They both said the same thing, but you didn't tell them who.  Dae'lin says that Dorian believes you are correct based on the puzzle you were putting together together.  But Dorian isn't a hunter Nox."

I sighed.  "No he just has a fucking photographic memory for **everything** he sees.  The puzzle pieces were inverted.  The second one made it click it filled in the tell tale peices that were missing from the first.  Levi showed me that weave.  He created it the testing room for me to see him ability to work with all the elements at the same time."

"So you what?  Chased him to the roof and he jumped.  Why would he do that?"  Margo asked.

"Because he thought he'd get away.  He thought he was better than I was and that I wouldn't follow him but I was the one who showed him how in the first place."  I sighed.  "In hindsight I shouldn't have followed, he was going to die either way.  But I was blinded by anger.  I wanted him to pay for what he'd done.  For hurting Dorian, and Nick and Mrs. Vega."

"I'm sorry Nox.  There will be a formal investigation.  Now that you are up and awake they will move you to the pschye ward for sucide watch until further notice."

I shrugged.  "Whatever.  It's not the first time and I doubt it'll be the last time."

Margo stood up and sighed.  "Nox.  They will take away children if they think you are a risk to their safety."

I growled, "No they won't."

"You really think your childhood was that bad?"

I crossed my arms and frowned.  "I'm done talking since no matter what I say is going to be used against me anyway."

"Nox."  Margo took a step and touched my check with the tips of her fingers.  "You know I beleive you."

"Yeah.  You beleive me but as usual you have too little power."

She sighed.  "Dr. Wilton will be in to see you in a moment.  He will give you the offical ruling and will be your doctor in the interim.  I've been found unreliable."

I asked, "Why?"

Margo looked at me with sadness.  "I've been dating your father for the past three years.  He came to me interested in you, but I couldn't speak to him about you.  We hit it off, and have been seeing each other since."

"It figures.  Why not have my motherly figure fucking my father."

She slapped me hard and I could feel the blooming hand print against my cheek.  "That is uncalled for.  I will forgive you this one - act a child again and you and I will terminate this relationship."

I looked down.  "I'm sorry."

"Really?"

"Yes, ma'am.  I shouldn't have said that.  My anger got the best of me.  I'm not angry at you.  Or my father. Just another thing to deal with."  I rolled over on to my side with my back facing her, "I'd rather be left alone now."

Margo put her hand on my shoulder and I had the urge to jerk it away but I hurt just rolling over so I didn't bother.  "Two more doctors and you can see Dorian."

"Such generoisity."## Doctors

Margo left the room and I could feel the tears rolling down my cheeks.  I had been delibrately mean.  I wanted to apologize more than I already had, but she was gone.  A new set of footsteps followed her wake.  I could tell by the smel of his cologne that he was older and male. 

"Mr. Sétanta.  I'm here to discuss things with you, if you can turn and face me."

I complied only so I didn't embarass Margo.  I couldn't imagine the face the man saw I was thankful for the lack of eye make up.  He didn't look like much, his hair was bristly and his eye glasses were thick.  I wondered if he were pretending to be human or if he was really this bad - Venatori with glasses was nearly unheard of.  Possible but very improbable.

"Tell me about yourself."

I frowned, "Really?"  He nodded and I sighed.  "You know my name and all that stuff.  I'm an improbable Minorem Cesari ranked the highest this generation.  I'm reckless and obnoxious and I don't have any friends.  Well that's a lie.  I have one friend."

"And this is what defines you?"

"For the most part."

Dr. Wilton sat down and jotted a few notes and then looked upa at me.  "I have read your files from Dr. Silverman and Ms. Rivera.  I see you have several attempts on your own life.  Can you tell me about the first time?"

"What do you want to know?  You want to know how it felt to take a razor slice of air and run it down my wrists?  Or do you want to know the feeling of the life running out of you before you passed out?  How about how it felt waking up in the hospital strapped to a bed so I wouldn't hurt myself.  Or what about.."

"Tell me why you did it?"  He interrupted.

I sighed and stared up at the ceiling.  "I was depressed.  I was 6.  I had been beaten for a year, my mother left me in the care of my abuser and I had no friends.  Life wasn't worth living anymore.  I was afraid, but I didn't understand what being Venatori meant at the time. I didn't know I couldn't hurt myself fast enough to do permanant damage."
 
"And the second time?"

I rolled my eyes.  "I didn't try to kill myself but the one time.  Margo taught me to value my life after that.  Gave me assignments to deal with my issues.  We stopped talking about what happened with my teacher and started dealing with my mental health.  It helped.  Knowing I was wired differently.  We tried medicine, but I reacted badly to Venatori meds and the human meds didn't work.  So we had to find other mechanisms to cope.  That's when I started jumping."

"Jumping gave me control of my fears.  It gave me hope.  If I could defeat my fear of heights to do that, I could do anything."

"So the second time ..."

"Was an accident.  I jumped.  I was experimenting with different weaves.  The wind caught it unexpectedly and I was carried over the cement and I got bruses and broke my arm."

"What about this time?"

I sighed.  "I was catching a bad guy.  I was doing my job.  It's that simple."

"You weren't authorized to go after this person.  No one knew what you were doing.  That was against protocol."

I shrugged.  "Whatever.  I jumped after him to keep him from running.  He ran when the place went into lockdown.  Tell me why they beleived Dorian enough to shut down, but not that I was chasing him.  But you are just doing your job so just tell me what I need to know and let the next egg head sit here in your seat and do their job so I can go sit in some holding cell twiddling my thumbs."

Dr. Wilton's face light up like a christmas tree with reds and blues.  He vein pulsed.  I was tired of being nice.  "You are here-by reprimanded to suicide watch until the investigation of this negligence is finalized."

He stood up and swung the door open and it smashed against the wall.  He stammered at the nurses.  "I'd sedate him before he's seen by another."  And he walked off down the hall I hoped I didn't have to see him again, but Margo wasn't to be my counsel on this one.

The third doctor stepped inside her green eyes sparkled and the patterns around her swirled and swayed and I had to look away.  I couldn't make myself stop seeing her patterns she was so uncontrolled.  I had never seen anyone with that much lack of control even a child who was first coming into their power.

"Mr. Sétanta.  I am Dr. Amara Eriksen.  I'd like to ask you about what Mr. Vega did."

"I don't know what you are talking about.  I have been unconscious for a while now.  No one's even told me."  I stated flatly.

"While you were unconscious you were nearly dead.  You started healing, stopped and would start again.  Until Mr. Vega came in here and spoke to you.  You were lucid for a few moments we have it on video.  But nothing came through."

"What did I say?"

She sat down.  "Dorian said you had wanted to show him how to share energy."

I smiled.  "Did I say anything?"

She nodded.  "You.  To hep."

"I must have showed him how to feed me resources to help my body heal."

"Can you explain that?"

I shook my head.  "Not right now.  I'm starving. And I'd like to see my ...."  I smiled.  "I'd like to see Dorian." I had wanted to say boyfriend, but I don't think Dorian would appreciate that sentiment yet.

"I will be stuck in a holding cell until futher notice, and you can ask me all the questions you like.  Until I see Dorian, and eat for a few days I will not speak to anyone else."  I closed my eyes and leaned back against the pillow.

"So that's it?"  She asked.

I didn't answer I was quiet in the darkness behind my eyes.  I was going to stand my resolve.  She sighed and left the room.  The door was almost closed when Dorian stepped inside with a frown on his face.  "Nox you have to talk to these people."

"No I don't.  I have days or weeks to talk to them.  But I wanted to see you."

Dorian smiled.  "They are monitoring everything in here."

I nodded.  "I'll behave.  I can barely move anyway."

Dorian chuckled.  "Good to know.  But watch what you say as well."  He sat down on the edge of the bed and touched my cheek.  "You need to shave."

I ran my fingers over my chin and thought I did as well.  "How long have I been out?"

"Almost two months."  Dorian said flatly.  "Most of it you were thrashing around and they had to tie you down.  Until you showed me what to do.  I didn't get it at first but then you passed out and I could only try."

I smiled.  "Thank you.  We are probably even now."

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  That only counts as one.  You've saved me twice. And if we get technical you saved my mother and I owe you for that too."

"Fine, but at least it's closer now."  I grined at him.  "I'm hungry."

"I placed an order and you should have food soon."  Dorian ran his fingers through my hair, "Your roots are showing too."

I laughed.  "Do I need to freshen up after my two months of sleep?"

Dorian smiled. "I don't mind.  But you shouldn't be shaving.  I can help if you'd like."

"I'd like."  I grinned at him.  "We can leave the color out though if you'd prefer."

Dorian ran his fingers through my hair again.  "I told you I like the color."

The door opened and a tray of food came in with an orderly.  He smiled at Dorian and when Dorian was taking the tray from him the orderly was checking him out.  I winked at the orderly as he left and smiled.  Dorian was busy with the food as the orderly left.  I grinned at him.  "He was checking you out."

Dorian sighed.  "That's been happening a lot these past two months.  Openly involved with a man seems to bring them out of the woodwork.  With the females too it seems.  I've had three propositions."

I picked up a peice of chicken with my fingers and popped it in my mount.  Dorian handed me a fork.  "You have no manners."

I stuck my tongue out at him.  He leaned in and kissed my cheek.  "Eat."

I ate as instructed while Dorian rummaged through another bag sitting in a corner.  "You weren't very nice to Dr. Silverman earlier."

"You saw that?"  I asked through mouthfuls but I didn't look at Dorian.  I didn't want to see his expression.

"Yes."

"I shouldn't have said it.  I don't have a problem with Margo with my father.  I hate that they use it against her."

Dorian put his hand on my shoulder.  "She knows.  At least that's what she said.  She said you'd feel bad, she said don't be surprised when he gets all mushy about it."

"I don't get mushy."  I grinned.

"That's what she said."  Dorian sat down on the bed next to me with shaving cream and a straight razor setting on the table.  He just watched me eat.

"So you really are going to help?"  I nodded toward his little kit. "And the old fashioned way."

He nodded.  "It's been a while since I've shaved another face, but yes."

I swallowed the last of what I had been eating.  "Are just going to stare at me whileI eat, or would you like me to stop.  I could be a while otherwise."

He grinned. "I don't mind. My day is clear."

"Clear?  Why did you clear your day?  You have kids to take care of."

Dorian smiled.  "I have you to take care of.  When I found out Jace was the only one coming to see you I came more often.  Your father has been here, but he's been out in the field with my father more often.  Nurse Morganstern says he doesn't stay long, and he didn't like watching you thrashing around.  She also said the only time you were ever calm was when I was here."

I smiled and looked down trying to look like I was busying myself with looking for the napikin I had dropped.  I knew why that was.  I'm not sure Dorian did.  He put his fingers under my chin and made my eyes meet his.  "It's alright."  He smiled and starte lathering the shaving cream in his hands and dabbing it against my skin.  It was cold, but his hands were warm I closed my eyes and rested while Dorian worked.  "I could shave it all off."

My eyes bolted open and he was grinning at me.  "I take it you don't want that."

"Preferably not."

Dorian smiled.  "I'll be careful."

I closed my eyes again as Dorian sharpened the blade on the leather strap, the sound was not comforting but I tried not to panic.  I trusted Dorian - I trusted him with my life.  I counted down from ten to try and calm my anxiety.  Dorian caught on to my anxiety and started humming the song my Nanny had sung to me as a child.  The razor touced my neck and the cold steel sent shivers down my spin.  I was really going to let him do this.  Dorian worked with percision.  "I found the name of the song.  Though the lyrics were in Draconic I'm not surprised you don't remember the words."

"What's the name?"  I managed to get out after three attempts.

"Sleep little dragon is what it translates to.  I can't speak draconic."

I tried not to move but it made me smile.  Dorian was careful.  He even used scisors to trim what he had left of my goatee and mustashe.  By the time he was wiping my face clean I had dozed several times.  I was completely woken up when Dorian stood up.  I opened my eyes and frowned.  "Not going anywhere,"  he said.  "Just putting things away.  You should sleep though."

"I'll have plenty of time to sleep over the next little while."

Dorian frowned.  "Sorry about that.  I wished they'd beleive me but aparently I'm not quite as impartial as they'd like."

"Because we've kissed."

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  I doubt they care about that.  The first day I gave them an ear full about how they needed to help you.  I cited a few Clandestine laws at them.  After you started getting a little better I gave them another and asked them why they stopped helping before I realized that you'd just run out of your own resources."  Dorian sighed.  "I started looking through your laptop in hopes that I'd find something on what you did to me.  But you didn't seem to have anything.  Someone wasn't happy I had been borrowing your laptop and reported it.  Theft is not looked highly upon, and since you were in a coma I couldn't exactly get you to say I hadn't been stealing it."

"I gave you the password.  I wouldn't have cared."

Dorian nodded.  "Thanks but it took some of my credibility away.  Ruining my image in all sorts of ways for you."

I frowned despite the smile that played on Dorian's face.  "Move over."  Then he looked at me a little closer, "Can you move over?"

I nodded and moved slowly to one side of the bed.  Dorian laid down on his side next to me draping an arm over my stomach, the added weight hurt a little, but I wasn't about to make him move it.  He settled in next to him his head against the pillow and I leaned in against him.  "I am not ruining anything by the way - my image.  I'm just adding you to it.  Now sleep."

I closed my eyes and leaned my head agaisnt Dorian's chest.  It wasn't quite comfortable but I was soon drifting alone in the darkness the only thing dancing in front of me was images of Dorian.  He hummed softly and I could smell his soft sweet scent and I felt safe as I let oblivion take me into the depths of my own darkness.## Relocation

I woke feeling slightly more rested but there was pain still everywhere.  I woke to Dorian's shallow breathing of sleep.  His arm still draped over my body.  I shifted uncomfortablly and he stirred.  He smiled down at me, "Hey."

"Hey yourself."  I said sleepily.

The table had been moved to the side I was sleeping on and I picked up a peice of bread.  There also looked to be more food than I remembered on it.  With a note.  I tried to sit up but that failed in a massive shootin pain everywhere in my body.  "Don't move Nox. Or they will have to strap you down again."

I nodded.  "There is a note."

Dorian sat up and reached for the folded peice of paper and handed it to me as he leaned back down and laid next to me.  I opened it.  "You need to stop doing this.  I'm getting tired of cooking for you.  Love you.  Get better.  - Mia"

I grinned and set the card down.  "I'm sure I will hear all about how she walked in on us later."

Dorian smiled lazily at me.  "If she's friends with you I'm sure you will."

"She's family."  I said absently.  I picked up the bowl closest to me and popped open the lid and started eating.  My stomach rumbled the second it smelled whatever delicious concontion lie in the plastic container.  

Dorian got up and I watched him stretch out the kinks, sleeping that way couldn't have been comfortable.  He smiled at me as I watched him.  He didn't come back to sit with me he busied himself with other things in the room.  Packing bags and looking for something.  He dropped a pair of shorts and a clean shirt on the bed.  "They will be moving you today I'm sure you'd like to be in something a little more suitable than a hospital gown."

I laughed.  "What you don't want all the pretty nurses and orderlys checkout out my ass?"

Dorian chortled.  "Whatever you want love."

I smiled happily.  "Love?"

He looked at me with a steady gaze before he answered.  "You started it."

I nodded.  "I did.  I..."

Dorian took a few steps and put his finger against my lips.  "I already know.  I am not sure why, or how this happened after one day, but I feel the same.  I would watch you from the other side of this room.  The window was always open and the door always closed.  You'd thrash with whatever nightmares you were having in your coma.  But the moment I opened the door you'd settle down into a quiet slumber.  It was like you knew I was there.  Nurse Morgenstern said it only happened with me.  I had asked even when Mr. Hill visited and she said, he'd come in lie down with you never working about whether or not you'd hurt him, but you never stopped twitching even though he was lying next to you."

"Jace hever made me feel safe.  He made me feel loved, but the nightmares were still there.  Always there.  Jace is used to my nightmares, he'd sleep with me like that when we were kids.  He'd push me out of bed some days because I was worse than other nights."

"Have you ever had a good nights rest?"  Dorian asked softly.

I shook my head.  "Not since I can remember.  There may have been a night or two but they are hardly worth remembering."

Dorian frowned.  "They will have to strap you down again while you heal."

I nodded.  "Probably.  Though if you try again, it might take the pain away."

Dorian smiled.  "I can try.  With your conscious instruction I might get more done."  He didn't hesitate he stepped closer to me and put his hands above me.  "First thing is to get all the elements flowing.  The threads were thin, the pattern you showed me was simple enough."

Dorian started with air.  "Start with water," I suggested.  Dorian nodded and started creating water, then air, fire and earth.  He rotated through all four elements.  I grinned at him.  He moved faster through each pattern before he touched my chest with one hand and my stomach with the other.  

I couldn't see the weaves but my back arched and I could feel the crawling of every cell in my body.  I wanted to scream but the pain was so bad I couldn't even open my mouth.  I don't know how long Dorian stood there feeding me his energy but he took a step back and almost stumbled.  He was smiling at me.  "I need to eat now."

I did my best to nod in the direction of the food.  He took a peice of bread and started nibbling at him.  "Did it help?"

I held up one finger from the hand on the bed that he could see.  He nodded.  and ate fully.  He looked ravenous.  

I managed to move and it didn't send shooting pains through my body.  "Yeah.  It helped I think.  But it hurt."

Dorian frowned.  "Did I do soemthing wrong?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I assume it's suppose to hurt when your body is doing double duty healing."

"It didn't hurt when you did it to me"

"I think it's the nature of the injury.  The worse it is the more painful it is.  It's hurt when I've done it to myself.  It could just be my reaction." I tried to reassure Dorian.  "I feel beter.  Honest.  Moving isn't kiling me."

The door to my room opened and a brunette with a purple streak stepped inside.  "I see you are both awake now.  Mr. Vega can I speak with him alone."  Her voice was familiar as was her face but I couldn't quite place her.

I shook my head.  "He's not going anywhere unless it's an emergency."

She frowned at me and I remembered her face then.  "If that's how you want to play it."

I smiled at her.  "He'll just watch from the camera on the other side anyway so what's the point Madison."

"You remembered my name.  I'm suprised."  she sounded incredulous - she didn't beleive that I'd remember her.  Remember the first person I ever had sex with.

"I can hardly forget you.  Even in the pain induced haze I'm in now.  One doesnt' forget their first, Madison."

She rolled her eyes.  "Can we put that behind us where it belongs.  We are adults now."

Dorian chuckled.  "You might be but I have my doubts about him."

She grinned and nodded her head towards Dorian.  "I like him."

I smiled. "Me too."

A deep blush rose in Madison's face.  "Sorry didn't mean to..."

"It's alright.  What do you need Nurse Pratt?" I asked.

"We are moving you today.  And I will be your nurse in the ward.  Now that you are awake, we need you to voluntairly submit yourself.  It will look better if you do it instead of court issued."

"I'm not admitting I'm sucidal to anyone.  I didn't try to kill myself."

Madison sighed.  "Okay.  But you won't be able to leave and you'll be under strict supervision if the court refers you to us.  Meaning no visitors, no contact with other residents."

I looked at Dorian and I couldn't imagine not having him there at least for a few minutes.  "Fine I'll sign the paperwork." I asked, "Why didn't you just get my father to sign it."

"We did try.  He wouldn't sign it.  Dr. Silverman wouldn't sign it.  Even Ms. Rivera wouldn't sign it.  You had no legal guardian.  Mr. Vega was never asked because as far as all records are concerned both of you are single."  

"We've been on one date.  And that wasn't exactly a date either."

Madison laughed, "You don't act like you've only just met.  The way you calmed down with him around, Nox.  The concern Mr. Vega shares for you.  You act like a couple hwo's been together for years."

I realized that there was a lot more to our relationship than I had originall thought.  I wasn't the only one who'd fallen fast.  I smild at Dorian then back at Madison, "We are just that perfect."

Dorian laughed and Madison rolled her eyes.  "I'll bring the paperwork in and you can sign it.  Mr. Vega, if you'd like to help him get dressed since moving is a bit rough right now for him.  I'd appreciate it.  We'd like to show him to his new room."

I sighed as Madison left.  So much for spending more time with Dorian alone even if it was in a hospital room.  The door shut and Dorian closed the blinds on the windows.  I grinned at him as he walked my direction.  "What you don't want them seeing what I'm sure they've already seen?"

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  That's not it."

Dorian sat me up and untied the knot at the back of my neck holding the gown closed.  His hands grazed my skin sending shockwaves through my body.  My attention was completely on Dorian as he helped me sit with my legs over the edge of the bed.  My body was starting to ache which was good and bad - partly because most of it was real pain and the other part was my lust for Dorian's touch.  

I sat naked on the bed once the gown had been completely removed the sheet was covering the more intimate parts of my body, Dorian had left it descretely in place as he pulled the gown from my arms.  He was protecting my modesty - as if I had some.

He knelt down and I watched him help me slide boxers over my feet.  I had to steand up, my knees felt like jelly as I stood there incapable of doing anything else.  Thsi was going to suck if this remained the same for more than the day.  

I sat back down and Dorian's fingers lingered on my hips before he started with the shorts.  He helped me stand up again and pulled them to my hips.  He was careful  with me.  Every touch carefully placed but still eliciting the same sparks through my body.  My heart was racing in my chest.  My mouth was dry and everything pointed towards a panic attack but I knew that wasn't it, there was no fear.

Dorian helped me sit back down before he started with my t-shirt.  Lifting my arms above my head hurt worse than standing up.  I tried not to show the pain but Dorian moved faster than he had before when he looked into my eyes as he pulled the shirt down over my head.  I leaned forward and felt the pain in my back muscle spring to life, but I kissed Dorian anyway.  I wanted to feel his lips against mine.  He stepped closer alleviating some of the strain, his hands running along my sides as his lips parted mine and the kiss pushed us both into a breathless moment.  He pulled away slowly and looked into my eyes.  I could see the heat in them.  I smiled.  "Thank you."

Dorian nodded still catching his breath.  "Anytime."

I laughed.  "I'd rather next time you take them off instead of put them on."

A small blush rose in Dorian.  "Maybe next time."

"Only when you are ready."  I lifted my hand to his cheek.  "I'll wait forever for you if I need to."

Dorian smiled.  "You don't need to wait, Nox."  He leaned in and kissed me softly.  "I'm waiting on you."

On me?  I didn't get a chance to ask him before the door opened.  "You ready to move Nox.  Mr. Vega..."

I interrupted.  "Dorian.  You make him sound old, he's your age."

Madision nodded.  "Dorian is welcome to join us while we settle you in.  But he will have to follow policy and only join you during visiting hours from here on out.  If you could sign here."

I sighed and signed the dotted line - willingly submitting myself to the pschye ward for sucide watch.  It was the only way I was going to be able to see anyone other than my nurses and doctors and I truly didn't want to miss out on Dorian.## Confessions

I hated feeling like an invalid, but I couldn't stand more than a few seconds before my knees buckled so Madison had a wheelchair waiting.  She pushed me while an orderly followed with my things which at the moment consisted of mostly paper bags full of food Dorian and Mia had brought me.  Dorian walked beside me.  I wanted to hold his hand, well I wanted to do more than that but it was uncomfortable to move so I kept m hands to myself.  Even sitting in the chair was painful.  Had I really broken every bone in my body?  I remember the pain I felt on inpact, it didn't surprise me really, but every bone?  It did feel like it though.

We took the elevator as the wheelchair wasn't going to manage the stairs.  Dorian knelt down next to and tried to distract me some.  He hummed the little tune again.  I grinned, "You are getting good at that."

He smiled.  "It seems to work for both of us."

"I'll have to remember that."  I said as the doors dinged open and Madison rolled me out of the elevator.  It was a short trip from the infirmary to the level of the pschye residences.  It was a wing in the adult residences with much better security and monitoring.  It said a lot about the Venatori that we had such a wing in our residences.  But then, when there were issues around the world, they came here too.  It was the best place to keep the mentally unstable Venatori and other supernatural creatures.  I heard there were a few dragons and were's here.  Vampires are usually killed my their own kind when they are mentally unstable - they aren't likely to get better.

Madison wheeled me through the locked double doors and stopped by the entrance desk.  She handed them my paperwork.  "This is Mr. Nox Sétanta.  He will be staying with a while.  And this is his friend Dorian Vega.  Mr. Vega needs to be added to the guest list for Nox.  He'll sign the needed paperwork and then you can show him to Nox's room.  He's been given family access."

Family access... I liked that.  They hadn't even asked.  Had Dorian.  But from the questioning look he gave me he hadn't either.  I shrugged and he smiled.  "I'll see you in a few.  I'll take care of this and see you soon."

I nodded but it wasn't like I had a choice Madison pushed me through another set of double doors.  "This is the common room.  You'll spend a good deal of your time here with the others.  It's breakfast time right now so no one is in here."  Madison pointed through another set of double doors.  "In there is the dinning room.  We'll show you that at lunch."  She pushed me through another set of double doors that lead into another hall.  "These are the rooms.  All rooms have windows and cameras with mics so we can hear you.  There is an intercom system if you need something.  Doors are key carded from the outside.  And unlocked during free time so you have access to your rooms if necessary."

We past mostly open doors inside of one I saw a man who's fire element was scattering everywhere, I knew a fire would start shortly and as we passed two doors down the fire alarm went off.  I nodded to myself and found the familiar sound of the blasts almost comforting.  "I can help him."

Madison asked, "What was that?"

"The man they were trying to sedate before he got angry enough to start a fire.  I an help him."

Madison shook her whole body when she spoke, "They've tried everything.  He can't learn, the mental capacity is not there."

I grinned at her.  "I can teach a three year old control I'm sure I can show him what he needs to keep his lid on."

Madison stopped in front of a room that looked very much like the others except the window was large, the door was locked and closed.  She waved her card over the locking mechanism.  "Because you submitted freely we can allow you access to other rooms, but when you aren't with the others you will be in your room with the door locked.  Your visitors will sit with you in here under observation."   She pointed to the three cameras that covered every corner and nook of the room.  "This is Sucicide Watch Level 1."

She sighed, "There are three level.  The next has no windows and really nothing in the room.  The last is complete isolation in a padded room.  I hope you never see the insides of that room."

"I'm not suicidal.  I haven't tried to hurt myself since I was 7." I said with fustration.

"Do you want me to help you out of the chair?  Or do you want to wait for Dorian?"

I shrugged, "The bed is probably more comfortable.  How long can Dorian stay?"

"Today he can stay until visiting hours are over.  They start in two hours and last for three.  That should be enough time to get you settled in."  Madison smiled.  "You really like him don't you?  I don't think I've ever seen you smile that much."

"I do.  Surprises me just as much as anyone else."

Madison helped me stand up and I tried not to put too much weight on her but she was Venatori and a lot stronger than she looked, she helped me with no problem.  By the time Dorian's shadow graced my doorway I was in bed and Madison had set up the table with food.  I was hungry still.

Dorian shook his head.  "I don't think he's ever going to stop eating."

Madison laughed.  "That's a good thing right now.  Today he's on bed rest, tomorrow we will try to get him up and moving and into physical therapy.  He'll need more food during that time I suspect as well.  Nox, I'll have the meal planner sent your way so you can set that up."

"I already gave them that.  Dr. Silverman gave me his unchanged list and I left it at the ront desk with the rest of his paperwork."  Dorian smiled. 

"Seriously, he's that predictable?"

I laughed.  "I've been eating near the same thing for most of my life Madision."

"Alright.  I'll be back in a few hours.  If you need anything there is a button on the bed and one by the door you can use to talk to us.  If you need to use the restroom we will need to have a male nurse go with you."

"I know the drill.  I've been here before."  I sighed and started eating the spread that was laid out in front of me.

Dorian sat down on the bed facing me and dropped another bag in my lap.  "It's all approved.  I figured you could use some distraction."

"A present for me?"  I grinned at him.  Inside the brown paper bag with handles was a composition notebook with blank pages.  "They wouldn't let your usual notebook in - the metal spiral was a danger."  The next thing I pulled out was a box of crayons.  I laughed but Dorian frowned, "They would only allow crayons.  No pencil pens or other implements of that nature."

I grinned at Dorian.  "No this is fine.  I can work with it."

There were several paper back books inside, I didn't recognize the titles, "I figured you could do with a little bit of mind stimulation as well."

I smiled at Dorian.  "Thank you.  What would you like me to draw?"

"Whatever you usually draw."  Dorian said with a smile.

"My drawings are of my nightmares, that's what the journal you must have found was.  Or you'd not know I like to draw."

Dorian blushed.  "I wasn't going to say anything.  I didn't look at much of it.  I liked the last image in the book though."

I smiled.  "Me too.  What would you like me to draw?"

"Whatever Nox.  I figured it could help you pass the time."

"You are no help.  I don't want to draw my nightmares with color.  I guess I'll figure it out."  Dorian just smiled at me.  

I sighed.  "You don't have to stay with me.  This is going to get boring rather fast."

Dorian nodded.  "I know.  But I like seeing you awake.  I can try another session if you'd like."

"Not today.  You nearly passed out.  We don't need you in here too."

Dorian laughed, "That could be interesting."

I raised an eye brow at him and pushed the table to the side and beckoned Dorian to come closer.  He did by scooting up still facing me.  I hurt bending forward but Dorian pushed me backwards and readjusted.  He sat on my lap which was only slightly more comfortable with his weight on my legs. But when he kissed me I forgot all about the discomfort and the pain. Electricity ran through my body when his lips touched mine.  He tasted of wine.  
Dorian's hand lifted my shirt and he touched skin underneath.  I could feel the feather light touches tugging at things much lower.  I let out a soft moan and Dorian smiled through the kiss.  He pulled back and I whispered, "We should stop."

Dorian nodded.  "When you are ready."

I grinned at him.  "We have an audience and I hurt."

"An excuse but don't worry about it Nox."

"You are really waiting on me?"  I asked Dorian.

"This means more to you than me.  I'm not saying I don't care or that you feel more than I do.  But sex for you meant something different.  Yes?"

I nodded.  "You've been talking with Margo or Jace."

"Both actually."  Dorian paused only breifly to touch my cheek and down my neck with his hand and I leaned into his gentle touch.  "I wanted to understand things so I didn't make you feel more at odds with your life.  Dr. Silverman was glad to have me come talk to her, but she said she couldn't tell me specifics.  Not without your written conscent.  Jason forged that consent however without my knowledge, apparently something the two of you did often."

I nodded.  "I don't mind.  Dr. Silverman didn't think you would and filed it with your records before handing me a copy of them.  Everything."

"Everything?"  I grinned, "So you've read her notes after I set Garrett on fire, and after my suicide attempt.  After Dylan beat the shit out of me and after I saved you?"

"Among other things.  Why do you mention those particular times?"  Dorian asked much like Margo would have.

"Because those are the major events that shaped my life.  There are others there as well.  Like the man going to jail, but I don't think Margo knew about it precisely.  She didn't like hearing about my sex life.  That was someone elses department."

Dorian nodded.  "I've his notes too."

"You do?"  I was shocked.

"Do you want me to read them?"  Dorian asked.  "I haven't touched them yet.  We hadn't discussed the situation so I wasn't sure if it was knowledge you wanted me to have."

"You can read anything about me Dorian.  I'm not shocked you have them, I'm shocked that he gave them to Margo after I left the Academy."

"You've not see him since then?"

I shook my head.  "I stopped seeing him when I was 16.  He told me he's taught me all he could and that I was capable of handling my own self in all possible encounters."

"What did he teach you?"

I smiled at Dorian.  "He taught me to control myself, my fears, my anxieties in situations where I lost control.  I met Adrian after Tim went to jail.  I was trying to fill the whole he'd created, Adrian knew I was underage but still he was game if I was.  He pinned me to the wall much like you did the other day but instead of telling him I didn't want to do that I froze, I became obideinet and complient.  I couldn't say no even if I wanted to.  Garrett had beaten it out of me.  That particular situation was beyond my control."

"Adrian stopped then and released me from my prone position and let me free of that fear with a simple 'I can help you.'"  I paused to take in Dorian's expression. "He taught me other words to say no, because I couldn't do it.  It took a while, but I found the safe words worked for me.  He taught me how to be in control whether I was on bottom or top."

I didn't have anything else to add to what Adrian meant to me.  He wasn't a lover, but he was a mentor of sorts.  We sat in silence for a while before Dorian asked, "Did you ever sleep with him?"

I nodded.  "Yes, a few times, but I was 16.  It was more of a final test than anything."  I added, "When I was 13 sex was just a tool to get people to be close to me - to hurt me without having to hurt me.  After Adrian sex was enjoyable.  I still used it to cope and push people away.  But I was in control of it.  It was like learning how to jump off a building.  It was freeing.  Without it I wouldn't be here.  I wouldn't be able to even think about more with anyone and certainly not you."

"Why not me specifically?"  Dorian asked.

I smiled weakly at him, "Because my feelings are so strong for you that I would have hurt you the most because you could hurt me the most."  I leaned back against the bed and stared up at the camera watching us.  "I have wanted you since we were kids.  Saving you was one of my better days.  The feel of your hand in mine when you helped me up.  The way you looked soaked in mud and grime it still tugs deep down inside.  I'd forgotten how I felt about you until I saw you when I came out of the elevator.  And everytime you kiss me or touch me now I can't help but want to have more of it."

Dorian's hands reached around my neck and he pulled me forward and kissed me.  My heart raced and my body ached for him.  When he pulled away he smiled.  "I will do my best not to hurt you, Nox.  I can't promise you I will succeed because relationships aren't something I'm good at.  And certainly, I'm not good at being in this place in a relationship where I have never been before either."

I smiled, "We'll learn together."## Little Blue Pills

I ate more than my fill and there was still enough food for later. Dorian even ate some.  I was tired but I didn't want to sleep while I only had a few hours of time to spend with Dorian.  Which he convinced me I had to do my hair.  He trimmed it carefully.  I didn't like being the complete center of his focus but then I didn't want it anywhere else either.  It felt strange having Dorian fussing over me like a child.  It took all my effort not to feel like I needed to smart off to him or to be rebelious against his instructions.  

His fingers in my hair made me shiver.  And then when he started filling in the dark color at the roots of my hair I felt even more awkward.  I had never liked going to a hairdresser for things like this - something I could easily do myself, but when I tried to do it myself against Dorian's instructions I found my arms hurting.  Physical Therapy was going to hurt big time - even more so than the burn.  I didn't think anything could be worse than that.  Now I know better.

Dorian was careful with the tips as well he said I couldn't see the color he'd chosen to dye my hair.  I was a little worried.  I wasn't fond of bright colors and prayed he didn't choose one.  While we waited I drew and Dorian watched me.  I felt even more childish as I sat with crayons and paper sketching out patterns before I set to sketching out him.  He was staring at me I could repay the favor.  He had only grinned at me as I'd flipped the page and started.

But the crayon's weren't working well so I flipped the page and conjoured up a pencil from nothing.  Dorian laughed.  "If I'd know you could do that I'd not have brought crayons."

I grinned.  "Crayon's don't work well when you need to erase things. And besides I like crayons."

Dorian sat up and watched as I started sketching his profile on the page.  "What else can you conjour up like that?"

I looked up at him.  "Anything I've studied the pattern of.  Any object with no mechanical parts.  I can conjour the parts but not moving ones all at the same time.  So things like guns I can't do, but the trigger, or the hammer and all the small peices together but it wouldn't be perfect and I wouldn't want to fire it."

"Anything living?"  Dorian asked.

I shook my head and set the paper and pencil aside.  "You know you can't create living things."

Dorian smiled, "And before the other day I thought healing was impossible."

"It is in the sense that you are healing them.  You aren't healing someone.  You are providing extra resources so the body can heal itself.  I don't expect you could do the same thing with a human who heals slowly."

"So tell me the mechanics then."

I nodded.  "There really isn't much to it.  There are technically five elements."

"That is new."

I smiled.  "The fifth element isn't bendable.  It exists between all patterns living or not.  If you were to zoom into the spaces between a pattern you could see little sparks.  Those sparks can be coased into things, like healing.  But you can't make it do anything, bend it to your will.  It's like an willful child and disobedient.  It has a mind of it's own.  Some scientists might call it the god particle.  It is the essense of everything living.  It sparks and transmits life.  You fuel a body with these life particles and the elements of the universe.  Together in unison they can heal a repairing body.  You can't replicate something from a once living thing, but you can from a living one, like cutting off a leaf and allowing it to take root.  You can dulpicate a plant because that is how it works in nature.  Our cells don't work like that on a large scale.  Could it be possible to clone a human from a cut off finger, or a peice of hair, maybe with years of study on the subject in genetics and dna and the patterns of life, but one without the other is doing to not work."

"Most of what I do is pure chemistry and physics.  I learned the basics in school and it lead me into different studies once I realized that the laws and such were very similar."

Dorian was wide eyed and listening carefully to every word I said.  "If I can get you a laptop can you write it all down?  Everything that's in your genius head?"

I shrugged.  "If you want me to, but I'm no genius.  Just a kid who plays with patterns."

Dorian stood up and started taking the headgear off.  His internal clock must have told him it was done, because we didn't set a timer for it.  I didn't even have my phone because I could use it to hurt myself.  I doubted they would let me have my laptop, maybe under supervision.

I closed my eyes and let Dorian finish his task.  I enjoyed his touch this time more than the last.  I was getting used to his care.  

When he was done he ran a comb through the top and styled it how he liked.  I didn't normally do anything other than run my fingers through it.  He helped me stand up and look at my reflection in the window.  Dorian had chosen a saphire blue color to highlight the tips of my hair, there were still stands of red running everywhere.  I grinned at him as he helped me sit back down in the bed.

He glanced down at his watch.  "I should get going.  I don't want to make them mad at me on the first day."

I nodded.  "Okay.  Thank you Dorian."  I paused, "For everything."

Dorian stood over me with a smile.  "Anytime love."  He leaned down and kissed me tenderly before he nicked the pencil and tapped it against my head.  "No more pencils I don't want you to get in trouble."

"Yes, sir," I said with a smile.  

He kissed my forehead and headed for the door.  "Tomorrow I will see about pooling our resources again.  I will eat well and sleep well tonight to insure that I'm well rested."

"Okay."

Dorian left just as Madison was opening the door.  Dorian let her in the stepped out.  She smiled.  "I was just coming to tell you visiting hours were over, and dinner will be served soon if you'd like to join the other residents."

I shrugged, "Why not?  I'm not sure I can walk that far today."

She smiled and flicked her purple locks from her face.  "We'll get a wheel chair for now.  Until you can move freely."

I sighed.  "I suppose."  

Madison pulled the wheelchair in from the hall and helped me get in the contraption and pushed me towards the dining hall.  She asked, "Did you have a good time with Dorian?"

She flicked a stray hair back into place.  I grinned.  "I always have a good time with Dorian."

"I assumed you have him naked and breathless when I walked in.  Didn't even look like you two were more than friends.  So not the Nox I remember."

"We all grow up sometimes."  I said flatly.

The dinning room was larger than I thought it would be.  It was full of people considered mentally unhealthy for whatever reason.  I could see several Magnus in the place, and a few other supernatural beings but what I saw more than not was Tacet.  They made me shiver, the fact that they had their givtl purged from their souls left mine aching in return.  To not have my ability would be a fate worse than death.  I wouldn't be me, and I was sure that they weren't who they had once been.

Madison rolled me up to a table.  "This will be your table from here on out."  She pointed to a little girl with blond braids and said, "This is Lori.  The girl next to Lori sat slightly taller than the blonde.   Her name was Jo and I could tell she was a were, but she was different than others I'd seen like she wasn't fully formed.

Madison pointed to a very large black man, "This is Julian."  He gave her a dirty look.  "He likes to be called Duke though."  She leaned forward and whispered, "And I'd call him that no matter what."

The final person who came later than I did Madison introduced, "This is Cliff", Madison hesitated and pointed to the empty chair next to him, "And this is Ameilia."

Ameilia's chair was sitting next to me so I offered her my hand and mimed shaking it and pulling it to my lips with a kiss.  "A pleasure Ameilia."  The look on Cliff's face made him light up.  I had acknowledged his friend.  

Madison just shook her head and muttered, "Always a flirt."  Her voice rose to include everyone, "This is Nox.  He'll be staying with us for a while."

Lori giggled.  "He likes Ameilia."

I smiled.  "I like everyone."

An orderly with a cart full of pills placed labeled pill cups in front of everyone and I looked down at the pill with two little blue pills in them and frowned.  "What's this?"

Madison leaned in a whispered.  "Everyone takes something.  It's an inclusion thing to help those who have to.  It's a sugar pill if you aren't on anything."

I nodded.  "Down the hatch."  I swallowed the pills without water.  They had an aftertaste that I didn't particularly like.  I decided water was best suited for the task next time.  

Food arrived under covered trays and everyone waited until everyone was served.  My stomach rumbled at the sudden sight of food.  It ached; I ached.  

The last plate was served and everyone in near unison was uncovering their plates.  Lori looked at my plate and laughed.  "You can have anything you want next time."

I grinned.  "This is what I want."  

Lori laughed.  "You ar weird.  What happened to you?"

"What do you mean?"  I asked.

"The wheel chair, or do you not walk ever?  You don't look frail like the others who are chair bound."

"Ah.  I shattered the bones in my body catching a bad guy.  They think I did it to kill myself.  Thus why I'm here."

The little wolf spoke softly, "Suicide watch sucks.  I'm surprised they let you have a knife, or anything sharp at all."

"Voluntary admission.  Suppose to help.  This is not the first time, nor the last, I'm sure."

The little blond twirled her hair as she poked at the pancakes with strawberry's on top with her fork.  She didn't look hungry, or act hungry but I was famished and hadn't realized that I'd finished most of the vegetables on my plate as we spoke.

Cliff interrupted.  "Ameilia says that you are cute."

I grinned at the man, "Of course I am.  But thank you Ameilia I appreciate it coming from someone so lovely herself."

Cliff blushed and hid himself behind his hands as he ate.  

Jo growled and rolled her eyes.  "You know she's not real right?"

I shrugged.  "She's real to Cliff.  We all see things a little differently.  Maybe Cliff here is seeing a ghost of some lost soul who doesn't want to move on.  Yeah it could be in his head, but I know things in my head are real."  I sighed as I finished the last bite on my plate and my stomach rumbled again as if I'd not eaten at all.

Lori giggled and handed me her plate.  I looked at it with disdain but I ate it anyway.  I was going to pay for this later.  I could feel the carbs sitting on my hips.  Duke laughed, "He's eating like a horse.  How do you stay so thin?"

"I don't normally eat this much, but my body needs healing fuel.  I did a number on myself before the jump, now it's worse."  I said and I hoped that's all it was.  My body just healing I didn't want to keep eating this much forever.  I felt like the Flash in the comics always hungry and always eating.## The Little Werewolf

Lunch, dinner, whatever it was was over sooner rather than later and Duke rolled me into the common area with the rest of their group.  He said as he pushed me, "We have arts and crafts today."

"Just like Kindergarden," I joked and the big black man chuckled and I could feel it reverberate in the chair itself.  I was impressed with the man's lung capacity and his sear strength.  It made me wonder why he was here, or why any of them where.  Cliff clearly was seeing things that made people think he was crazy.  I didn't think he was crazy.  But I couldn't prove it, and I wasn't a pschologist.

He pushed me up to a table with a bunch of art supplies, no scissors I noted as I pulled a blank peice of paper over.  Lori sat down next to me and Jo next to her.  The two men took up places at the easel's to paint something.  Nox had never given it a shot, he prefered drawing, it came naturally to him.

I started doodling things I saw around the room.  Lori's hand next to mine, the pattern around Jo, the objects across the room.  It wasn't much just simple sketches.  Jo commented as she glanced at my paper. "You are pretty good."  He hand reached across Lori and put her finger on the sketch of her pattern and asked, "What's this?"

I grinned.  "You."  

"I take that back you are a horrible artist."

I laughed as I sketched her into the blank spaces where her features would go, her hair, the way she was pouting as she watched me finish the drawing.  "It's how I see you, more or less.  The way the patterns move around you."

"I don't get it."

Lori giggled, "He's a Magnus.  He can bend an element."

"Actually I can bend all the elements."  I held my hands in front of me and four balls of identical size and shape formed above my hands.  I'd done it so often as of late that the particular trick was becoming instanteous.  "At the same time."

Lori's mouth feel open in the shape of an O. "He's Cesari."  She snuggled up against my arm and patted it.  "I'm in love."

I laughed as a voice behind me said, "Well that was fast."  I turned to see Madison sitting down on the opposite side of me.  "What will Dorian think?"

I grinned at her.  "Flirting?  I honestly don't know.  He's not said anything yet and I've flirted with several people in front of him."

Lori asked, "Who's Dorian?"

I smiled but Madison answered before I could say anything, "His boyfriend."

I'd have denied it except it had been the precise thing I was going to say.  Though it wouldn't have come out like, you are wasting your time with him, he's gay.

I expected Lori to pull away and pout but she didn't she curled up closer, "I'll love him from afar then."

I laughed again, "Yeah, that's real far away."

She poked me in the ribs and I jerked away too fast hurting my already soure self.  I sighed.  "Be nice."

Lori poked me again and I dropped the ball of water on her head.  "I said be nice."

She pouted now.  Jo laughed. "I like him."

Madison smiled and leaned in to whisper to me.  "I put you in the right place."

I asked, "How so?"

She nodded towards the girls, "They haven't been overly open with anyone we've put to the group.  Cliff and Duke were here before them, and they are like father figures to the girls.  These two are very quiet."

I grined.  "I bring out the best in everyone."

Madison rolled her eyes.  "Alright.  You girls take care of Nox here. But don't get drawn in by this pretty face like I did."

"Oooooh," Lori said.  "You two know each other?"

I nodded. "She was my first."

"Your first what?" Jo asked.

"The first person I slept with - male or female".  It was the truth I spoke there wasn't any point in lying but Madion smacked me in the arm.  "Ho that hurt.  I'm not lying."

Madison rolled her eyes.  "Its for saying it so loud."

Lori asked innocently, "Was he your first?"

The question turned Madison's face the color of the rose pinned to her shirt. She muttered something as she left.  So I answered the question. "No.  I was a pitty..." fuck is what I wanted to say but I opted not to finish the sentence at all let them imply what they wanted.  "I was a too skinny kid who had problems and I was fawning over the same guy she was crushing on at the time.  It was a one off thing.  We never really talked much after that."

Jo asked, "But I thought you liked guys?"

"Why does it seem to be one or the other with most people.  I grinned at the two girls, "I enjoy sex no matter who it's with."

Jo whispered, "But you like one more than the other?"

I shrugged.  "If you made me choose, yeah probably."

Lori laughed, "So choose."

I sighed, "Fine.  If I had to choose one or the other it would at this moment be men.  I like men."

Jo whined, "Why?"

I laughed, "I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you."

Duke laughed behind me.  "Don't get any ideas magic boy."

I turned around and felt my muscle strain with that effor to look at Duke behind me.  "I won't, big man.  I'm firmly in play with someone else."

Cliff added from behind his own canvas, "Ameilia is dissapointed."

"Ah, she can come over anytime Cliff - anytime."

A bell rang and everyone scattered, I caught Jo's arm before she passed me completely.  "Can you take me to my room?"  Jo looked around and saw that the room was empty and sighed.  I asked, "Have you changed yet?"

"What?" Jo asked.

I put my hands on the wheels and stopped us, I grabbed her hand and pulled her so I could look at her, she came hesitantly.  "I know you are a were, have you changed?"

"I don't understand."

I sighed.  "Take me my room, can you stay and talk?"

"Yeah I guess.  Curfew isn't for a few more hours."  Jo wheeled me to my room.

She pushed the door open and pushed me through.  "By the bed please?" I asked.  I didn't think I needed help to move if I was close enough.

Jo obliged me and I lifted myself and literally fell on to the bed with an amazing sprawl.  It hurt so bad.  I tried to pull at my power to heal myself a little but I couldn't hold the stream for long, it was sapping my strength. "This so sucks."

Jo sat down in the chair by the wall.  It was bolted in not that it would matter if I really wanted to get violent.  I was suprised I wasn't in a fire-starter room.  I know they had them, I'd been in one before when I was 6.  I pushed those thoughts away and looked across at the brunette staring at me.  

"So what did you want?"

I nodded.  "Tell me how you came to be here?"

"Why?"  Jo sighed, "Oh never mind, I'll tell you.  I came her because a man dropped me off here after he caught me because I had a violent episode - rage induced something or other they said in a store and I hurt some people pretty badly."

I asked, "Was it anywhere near the full moon?"

"How would I know?"  She was about to leave, she was getting up annoyed at my questions.

"Please don't go.  Really I'm just trying to help?  Were you ever bittien by a dog or a wild creature?"

"Yeah.  About two years ago, my parents were killed by the pack of wolves that attacked us.  I was in a foster home until that man told them i would be better of here."

I nodded.  "So you don't know you are a werewolf then?"

"What?"  She didn't beleive me, the sound of her voice was telling me that.  "There are no such thing as werewolves or vampires."

"And there is no such thing as magic."  I could barely muster up a fireworks show from nothing.  She didn't looked impressed, but then I'd done the same earlier.

"It's all just a trick."

"Actually it's all very real.  I'm a Magnus.  You are a werewolf.  Most of the people here aren't overly special except they are Venatori not human.  There are a few exceptions like yourself."

"I don't believe you."  She rolled her eyes and walked out of the room leaving me to my self in the darkness of my room.## Dreaming of Dorian

I laid down on my new bed and found it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.  It wasn't a cot so it really was better than what I slept on while out in the field.  My body hurt.  My stomach ached with hunger pains but the left over food Dorian and Mia had brought me was on the other side of the room and I didn't feel like calling a nurse in so I could eat yet again.

I closed my eyes and thought about the one person who had made my day today - Dorian.  Not only had he spent a majority of his day with me, he was intersted in thing I said.  Not that I didn't like listening to my own voice, but no one really ever listened when I said anything.  I was just that obnoxious kid who happened to be Cesari.  Everything else I was only detracted from me.  I was nothing amongst the Venatori.

I drifted to sleep with Dorian heavy on my mind.  The darkness overcame me as usual.  But it wasn't filled with the glowing eyes.  It was a happy scene - me and Dorian close, very close together our bodies interwined as much as humanly possible.  It felt good to be close to him - to someone who wanted more than just sex.

The darkness drifted in again on wisps and soft breezes until there was nothing left of the happy scene.  The glowing eyes grew and I fell into the darkness alone and afraid.  A meancing laugh echoed in the darkness.  Fire light everywhere surrounding me.  The glow of the fire made the shadows move.  I saw figures in front of me and I started awake the moment I saw the demon tentacles had embraced Dorian around the neck and he was limp like a rag doll.

My heart was pounding and my body was covered in sweat.  This was the first time my dreams had centered around hurting someone else.  I could hardly breathe.  

This was not how I had envisioned my life, dreaming of my own pain and suffering I was used to but now, it threatened Dorian.  I wanted to call him, but I didn't have my phone, which also meant I had no idea how long I'd slept.  I just knew it was dark and everything was quiet around me.  

So I got up and started doing push ups and sit ups and other things to keep my mind occupied, it hurt like hell, but the counting always helped. It was why it was a usualy go to when I couldn't sleep.  Some people thought I pushed myself too hard, but it really was a coping mechanism.  And tonight was no different.

Except this time it did little to calm my anxiety.  I tried to take deep breaths but I couldn't even focus on that through the pain.  I ended up sitting at the table in my room with a floating ball of light above my head as I sketched my nightmares on the notepad Dorian had brought for me.  It was probably the most detailed drawing I'd ever done for a dream.  The details screamed at me in my head, I couldn't shake them even as they were recorded on the paper in crayon.  

I didn't so much as feel the sun on my back but I could tell the sun had risen as things started to move outside my locked bedroom door.  A familiar beep sounded and Madison walked into my room and stopped just inside with the wheelchair she'd brought with her.  "What are you doing out of bed?"

I flipped the notebook closed and sighed.  "Nightmares."  She pushed the chair towards me and I stood up.  "I'll walk."  I could feel the pain in my legs radiate through my body as Madison frowned at me.

"No you won't."

"Yes I will."  I put my hand on the door frame and started walking towards the cafetria area.  "I won't be helpless anymore."

"Nox, you'll hurt yourself worse."  She hurried up with the chair still in front of her.  "Nox.  Sit down."

I shook my head and kept walking one foot in front of the other.  I made it to the table I was assigned and sat down.  My heart was racing, and my body ached from the exertion and I collapsed in the chair.  Madsion frowned at me as she left shaking her head.  

"You look tired."  The big black man sitting next to me said.

I grinned at him.  "Between nightmares and walking here I'm not so much tired as I hurt."

"Well why did you walk you idiot?"  Lori asked.

"Because I'm stubborn that way."  We were still waiting for Jo and Cliff and Ameilia to show up so I decided to fill the silence. "When are visiting hours?"

Lori giggled, "Why you expecting someone?"

I gave her my brightest smile, "Of course I am.  I'm popular.  And I was really hoping to get some from Dorian."  Which was not exactly a lie, but Lori turned the color a beat.  I hoped Dorian did as promised and slept and ate well, I could really use the help, I didn't want to walk anymore like this, but I didn't want to be pushed around either.  It was a no-win situation.

I looked at Duke and winked; he moved his chair away from me a few inches and his voice rumbled, "Don't get any ideas."

I laughed.  "I could show you a thing or two."

Jo took that moment to sit down with a curious look on her face.  "Do you flirt with everyone?"

I nodded.  "I try to.  But see that wasn't flirting, that was making my main man Duke here uncomfortable since he found my having sex with men uncomfortable.  It's a habit."  I turned to the big black man and smiled. "I'm sorry.  I will attempt behave myself."

Duke grumbled something that sounded like don't worry about it but it didn't really matter.  Cliff joined us and I offered my hand to Ameilia and brought it to my lips, "A pleasure as always Ameilia."

Lori giggled and Jo rolled her eyes.  Duke was the only one to comment, "You shouldn't realy encourage him."

I smiled.  "I encourage everyone to live their lives the way they wish to.  And since you don't particularly enjoy my advances at least someone else does."  I wanted to stick my tongue out at the big man but he rolled his eyes and me and I afraid he might actually try to hurt me.  

The medicine carts rolled through and everyone swallowed their pills.  I still felt wrong doing it.  I didn't need meds.  I hated faking it.

Breakfast arrived, a perfectly cooked frata that had Jo and Lori oggling and this time I did stick out my tongue at them.  "Mine."  I covered my plate with my arms and grinned at them.  Jo pouted until I offered her a fork full of my food which she took  delicately with her fingers and pulled it off my fork before tossing it in her mouth.  Lori pouted and I handed her a peice too. They both looked at me with delight.

I took a bit and found it passable, not the best I'd had.  "I make better."

Both of the girls eyes shot open, and Jo asked, "You cook?"

I nodded and waved my hands over my body, "You think a bod like this comes from eating fried food and grease laden cafeteria food?"

Both girls burned a light shade of pink before they settled into eating their own food.  I finished mine in three more bites and was still starving.  This was not good.  I was still draining too many resources.  I could barely move, my ability was scant.  I wasn't like it at all.  I disliked being disconnected from who I was.

Madison interrupted our breakfast, "Nox, Dorian is here.  He's in  your room waiting.  He said he didn't have long."

I nodded.  "I'll get there on my own."

Madison only shook her head.  "Bull headed boy still."

I grinned at her.  "Yup."  I turned to my table with a wicked grin.  "I'm off to see the wizard."  And I got up slowly and walked - rather I hobbled to my room.  It didn't take me as long to get back as it had to get there, the food supplying much needed energy.

I stood in the doorway while Dorian was staring at the drawing I'd been working on.  "Hey you."  I smiled.

Dorian looked at me with a frown and flipped the notebook closed.  He took me by the arm and sat me down on the bed with a furious glance.  "Why are you up?"

"Because I can't stand being wheeled around."  I said flatly.  "You aren't even going to ask what that was in the journal?"

"I presumed a nightmare.  Am I wrong?"  Dorian said with confidence.

"No.  But it's not my normal nightmare.  I don't normally dream about you like that."  I grinned at him as he helped me lie down.  There were very few rods exchanged as I saw Dorian start practicing the patterns need to heal me and he set to work.

I could feel the pain of the bones healing, and the muscled strengthing.  It was crude and painful and I wanted to scream but I didn't, I didn't want Dorian to stop.  When he did it was like a crushing weight had been lifted from my entire body but I sat up without help and only a small twinge of pain.

Dorian looked a little tired.  "I'm sorry that it saps so much strength."

Dorian grinned at me and put his hand on my knee closest to him. "It's okay.  You needed it.  You already look better.  I'm only glad to help."  He stood up and offered me a hand to stand which I took gratefully but not because I needed the help but because I wanted to touch him.  He pulled me close, "You dream about me?"

I bit my bottom lip and lowered my eyes and nodded.  Playing coy wasn't a usual thing for me but with Dorian it happened without a thought.  "It's mostly day dreams, last night was the first dream and it turned horrible.  I wanted to talk to you so badly last night but I don't have a phone."

Dorian sighed, "I'm sorry."

I grinned up at him.  "It's not your fault.  I'll learn to deal with it.  I'm not used to worrying about someone else like that."

Dorian smiled, "Now you know how I feel."  He pressed his lips softly against mine, it was a just a small kiss before he pulled away.  "I have to do alot of catch up from yesterday.  I will stop by for lunch.  I already made sure that was alright."

I nodded.  "Okay."  I caught his hand as he turned to walk away.  He looked back at me.  "Thank you Dorian."

He kissed me again softly this time there was a lot more behind it but it was still too short.  But a throat cleared in the hall and Dorian smiled as he pulled away.  "I'll see you at lunch."

Jo stood in the doorway and stepped aside as Dorian left.  "He's cute."

I sat down on the bed and waved her in, "He's more than cute Duckling."  Jo sat down next to me on the bed which was a bit of a surprise, "What's up?"

## Father and Sons

Jo stared off at the wall in front of her before she finally said something.  "I'm sorry about last night."

I shrugged and leaned back against my bed, my head resting against the wall.  "No worries.  Finding out you are a werewolf is kinda a shocker to anyone.  I take it you've not turned yet."

Jo shook her head.  "Our were professor says it happens at different ages for different creatures, but a werewolf in their early twenties.  You shouldn't be in here you should be with a pack."

Jo was pale and staring straight ahead.  I wasn't sure she was even listening to me.  "I might know an alpha who can help you.  Though he's not part of a pack.  And fledgling wolves do better in packs.  If you were a tiger you'd probably be alright with finding another to teach you as they are solitary creatures even out in the wild."

Jo turned and looked at me, "You sure know alot about werewolves for being ... what did Lori call you?"

"Magnus.  Cesari specifically.  But I'm Venatori - well half anyway.  It's my job to know about the supernatural races.  I can't exactly hunt them if I don't know anything about them can I?"

I didn't think Jo could get any lighter but she did, all color washed from her as she whispred, "You hunt us?"  Her eyes grew angry and hateful, "Do you kill us too?"

I shook my head.  "I try not.  But I'm rare in that department.  I've killed those that attacked me.  But I tend to capture and let there be a trial."

Jo leaned back like I was and curled against my side which I thought was odd, but I didn't object.  She whispered, "You smell like a forest."

I grinned, "That's a new one.  Usually I smell like a campfire."

I feel Jo taking a deep breath against my skin with a soft nod, "That too."

There was a soft knock on my door and Jo sat bold upright and scurried out the door before I even had time to tell her it was alright.  I watched her hurry past my father who was staring at me in wonderment.  "Does Dorian know?"

"Does he know what?"  I asked.

Kai nodded after Jo, "The girl scurrying away from your bed."

I shrugged.  "I wasn't doing anything."

Kai only nodded and pulled the chair to the side.  "You look better.  Dorian told me you could move today?"

I nodded.  "Since when do you talk to Dorian about my well-being?"

"Since he spent nearly every night sleeping in a chair by your bed while you were unconsious."  He smiled at me.  "Don't hurt him, or I'll Emilio have you."

I grinned at my father.  "I have no intentions of hurting Dorian, Dad.  I like Dorian."

"Dad?"  Kai asked with a smile.

"It felt right."

He stood up and offered me a hand, "Let's go to the gym, get you back in shape.  I'll take it easy on you."

I took his hand and we walked to what the ward called their gym.  It was mostly cardio equipment, but there was an area where it looked like yoga or other cardio classes too place - there was not a weight in sight.  I sighed.  Kai only laughed.  "Sparring?"

I nodded, "Alright."

I took my socks and shoes off and stretched a little while my father watched me.  "You are moving stiffly, a little more stretching than usual."

I nodded and continued with what I'd been doing, I agreed with him.

I could feel the ache in my muscles despite the healing Dorian had done.  I still could barely touch my gift, but at least I could move more freely without too much pain.  

I stood up and took a fighting stance and my father followed suit.  He grinned at me, "No cheating."

I stuck my tongue out at him.  "I can't touch my ability which puts me at a disadvantage."

Kai smiled, "I'll go easy on ya.  This time."  

But I knew better than that, his easy wasn't going to be the same as my easy and he proved that point when he threw the first punch which I blocked and I felt the bruise blooming on my forearm.  My father was full Venatori which meant super human strength to my normal strength.  But I reached for my ability and cased myself in air.  My father frowned.  "That is not fair.  I thought you said..."

I smiled.  "I'm not going to walk around looking like you beat me up.  I can't do much more than this though."

He nodded, "Fair enough."

We danced around each other gauging the other's speed and ferocity before my father let loose.  He jabbed me in the stomach and smacked me upside the head twice but I got in a few good licks before he held up his hands breathing heavy.  I bent over to catch my breath as my father patted my back.  "Well done, and for being injured I'm impressed."

That was high praise coming from my father.  He sat down and stretched again.  I followed suit, there was no need to hurt myself further.  He looked over at me, "That girl.  Who is she?"

"Jo?  She's a werewolf - though she didn't know that before yesterday when I told her."

"She looks familiar."  Kai mumbled to himself as he popped the water bottle he had with him and handed it to me.

We didn't speak much more until we were in the hall and heading back to my room.  I needed a shower.  "How are prospects coming?"

I frowned at him not knowing what he was talking about, he added, "The Dowager girl and several others had appoints with you before all this happened."

"Ah."  I shook my head.  "Reschedule them I guess, they can come visit me here.  Same with all those other people who wanted to talk to me."

Kai nodded, "Would you like me to do that for you?"

I shrugged, "Dae'lin usually handles it but that's up to you.  I've limited time here and Dorian gets first dibs."

"You really are serious about him?"  He shook his head.  "I find it very hard to believe that two of my sons like the same sex."

I smiled at my father.  "I like women too, unlike Nick."

"I know but that doesn't make it any better.  I wonder where I failed."

"You didn't fail either of us.  You had no chance with me and Nick just likes guys nothing you could have done either way.  I like Dorian a lot.  I get he's a family friend, but to me, he's just a kid I want to school with and had a crush on.  I wasn't part of the Viddens Vega family relationship until now.  I'm not going to hurt your best friends son on purpose.  Dorian's a good man."

Kai laughed, "I never saw you for the settle down type."

"I want a family.  A big happy family one day.  I doubt it'll be traditional since I'm not exactly follow the rules sort of guy."  I opened the door to my bedroom.  "I need a shower, Dad.  Come by again and we can do it again."

Kai nodded.  "That sounds like a plan.  I'll schedule that in too."

I grinned.  "You are getting the idea."

Kai shook my hand and I stepped into my room to grab a change of clothes before heading down to the showers.## Confessions

My days in the ward drew closer together, I forgot from one day to the next what day of the week it was.  Everything was perfectly scheduled, it was probably the most at peace I'd been in the past ten years.  I knew exactly where I was supposed to be and when.  

I had lunch daily with Dorian and sparred every other with my father.  I met with Margo once a week, and Dr. Wilton everyday for 30 minutes or so.  I even met with Dr. Eriksen about things she wanted to know about - mostly me and how was doing, but she asked some very weird questions.  Things like how I was feeling that day, if I felt sorer than usual even though I'd been doing better.  Dorian had even stopped giving me his energy.  Of course it had been at my prompting.  I could touch my ability again and do drips and drabs to continue the healing process.

I hung out more with Jo and Lori than with anyone else at our table.  I think Cliff was stepping back because he had a crush on me and Duke was afraid I had a crush on him.  Neither of them really paying any attention to the fact that I was completely smitten with Dorian.  So much so that both Lori and Jo commented on it nearly everyday.

I also had a few conversations with women who supposedly wanted Cesari children.  Anabel Dowager had come one day handing me a slip of paper with scheduled times over the past few months.  She said we'd plan specifics once I was released.  She also informed me that her mother was pushing for a much earlier release.  Which I wasn't going to argue for.  The more people on my side the better my chances of getting out of this joint were.

The large girl from the cafeteria had also come to see me, her name was Amanda Brighton and she did want what everyone else wanted.  I turned her down, but not because of her looks because she expected that I would enjoy a foul mouth on a woman.  I don't mind dirty talk in the bedroom but before we get there it's a bit much.  I think my reputation had preceded me with her.  I didn't remember her being part of my crowd, but then very people were ever part of my crowd.  Though the rumors were always pretty bad anyway.

Today I had a meeting with Dr. Eriksen about my health.  I wasn't looking forward to it.  After than I hoped I could get Margo to get me out of here, but she wasn't officially my pschyologist at the moment so I'd requested Dr. Wilton's presence as well.  

My meetings with the docotors were after lunch and I was looking forward to spending time with Dorian.  He'd come everyday for the past few weeks as I sat in this place doing absolutely nothing.  He always gave me something to draw while he was gone, so I had a notebook full of things I'd drawn at his request along with my recurring nightmares.

Dorian sat at my little desk flipping through the latest drawings and back to other drawings he'd asked me to draw.  I could see the wheels turning as he searched through the pages for something.  I was tired of him being so far away so I went to him and put my hands on his shoulders and looked over his head at what he was looking for.  There was a momentary stiffening as I touched him, but he relaxed into my hands quickly enough.  This was still a very public location for Dorian even though it was currently my bedroom.

Dorian flipped between two drawings, one more recent than the other and back to one I'd done earlier in the week.  He asked, "These aren't the same, but they feel the same."  He commented.

I took the notebook from him and carefully cut both pages out and laid them down on the desk for him to compare.  He looked up at me like I'd ruined something.  I grinned at him.  "I can fix it."

I put them back in their places and essentiall glued them back together with fibers made from my own creation.  He shook his head.  "Do you use your abiltiy for everything?"

I nodded and winked at him, "Not everything.  Though that could be interesting.  A few extra hands and appendages could come in useful."

Dorian blushed knowing exactly what I was talking about.  I handed him the papers again and he set them down and examined them.  "These?  What are they?"

Dorian pointed at the shining stars between the patterns.  "Life."  I said simply.  

"That's how you see it?"

I nodded.  "If I look close enough, yes."

He blinked at me and then wove a pattern of pure air in front of him and I could tell he was focusing hard on the pattern.  "It's always there?"

"Always."

Dorian sat there staring at his own creation until a slow smiled spread on his face.  "But you can't manipulate it?"

He looked up at me with curiousity and eagerness.  He enjoyed learning new things, and this he was in heaven.  He'd asked me the same questions over and over again but he never quite beleived.  I nodded at him. "You cannot manipulate life."

He sat studing different weaves he could create, he was becoming rather adept at it without any formal training.  I wondered if he tried to test himself in the wee hours of the night when no one was in the testing rooms.  I doubted Dorian really cared for all his research into things.  I kneeded his shoulders as they grew tense with concentration.  I felt him relax into my fingers and groan softly as I worked the knots in his shoulders.  

Dorian grabbed a hand and pulled me around in front of him and down into his lap.  I sat in stunned silence as his fingers played with the belto loops of my jeans.  I looked down at him bitting my bottom lip wondering what he had in mind.  I could feel his body react to being this close to me and I responded in kind.  We still hadn't done more than pretend we were teenagers making out on my bed - all hands and lips over skin and not much below the belt.  And I really didn't expect more with cameras in the room.  But that didn't stop my body from wanting so much more.

"Don't do that."  Dorian's hand rose from my hip to my lip and ran his finger over my bottom lip until I released it.  

I leaned forward and pressed my forehead to his and whispered, "But you like it."

Dorian pulled my chin down and kissed me deeply as he stood up.  I gasped into his mouth and I had little time to protest the maneuver as he carried me with Venatori speed to the bed and had me lying on my back with his body over mine.  I didn't have time to fight the panic attack before Dorian's mouth envolped my entire consioucness.  There was nothing but he and I.

And as always when we got going, hands and lips someone opened the door with a studdering, "Oh, I'm sorry."

Dorian looked up and rolled his eyes.  "It's not like it's the first time Madison dear.  You've walked in on everyday this week." Dorian was sitting up and straightening his shirt that I'd pulled out of his pants to get to his skin underneath.  "I suppose that means Dr. Silverman is here with Dr. Wilton?"

Madison nodded, "They are early."

Dorian leaned over and kissed me fully on the lips and pulled away breathless then whispered, "Dream about me tonight."  He got up and headed for the door.  He smiled at Madison, "We should start charging."

Madison blushed as Dorian walked out the door closing slowly behind him.

I didn't bother with straigthening myself as Dorian had.  I didn't really care what Margo or Leroy saw.  Madison walked beside me to the small room used for pshcye consults.  She stopped at the door and smiled, "He's more braizen each day."

I laughed, "I think it's more to do with need rather than actually changing."

"Meaning?"

I leaned over and whispered to Madison, "He wants me that bad.  And he knows it's mutual and we've yet to actually **do** anything about it."

She blushed as I opened the door.  "Knock next time."

Madison nodded and I entered the small room where my two lovely therapist sat.

Margo sat in a folding chair while Dr. Wilton sat in the plush one leaving me with the stupid couch.  I hated the couch.  I sat down and smiled at my long time therapist.  "How goes it?"

She smiled at me as she always did.  "I'm fine.  Did we interrupt something?"

I grinned at her.  "I don't kiss and tell."

Dr. Wilton cleared his throat.  "You know that is a lie.  In saying it you imply what you were doing."

"If you are implying we were kissing I will say yes to that.  But if you want more details too bad."

The man pushed his glasses up as they slid down his pointed little nose.  "And if it were part of your recovery you'd be required to tell me, but your love affair with Mr. Vega is not any of our business.  Shall we?"

I sighed.  "Fine.  What is on today's agenda?  Am I still suidical?  Nope.  Am I going to jump off building for the hell of it?  Yep.  Am I trying to kill mysel? Nope.  And anything I'm leaving out?"

Dr. Wilton jotted down my answers and sighed.  "Why do you insist on jumping from the building?"

"Because I can.  Because it feels good to fall for those 8 seconds it takes me.  I trust my ability."

"But you just recently got that power back after taxing yourself too hard.  It could fail you in the middle of the jump."  He honestly sounded concerned for my well being.

"And do you not drive a car because it could blow up any second?  Or fly in a plane because it will crash into the ocean drowning you?  Do you stop eating because you could choke on your unchewed bite or swallow a bone that could peirce through your larnyx?  No you don't because the probability is slim and you trust in it.  I trust my ability.  I trust myself implicity.  I will not jump if I feel weak.  I will not use my ability unless I know I can fully function.  I am not an idiot.  I value my life more than I value most things."

Margo whispered, "Except maybe Dorian's life."

I grinned at her.  "Yes.  I value Dorian's life above my own.  I would do anything to keep him alive.  Anything!"

Dr. Wilton.  "Mr. Setanta..."

The door opened and Dr. Eriksen poked her strawberry blonde head into the room.  "I'd like to speak to all of you together if I might."

Dr. Wilton waved her in and gave her the cushy chair and unfolded another folding chair in the corner.  The room just got a whole lot smaller with little miss doctor with chaotic patterns.

The doctor sat down and I averted my eyes from her I felt like I was going to vomit her pattern was chaotic and I could not make it go away because it was too strong.

"You're healing power is exemplary Mr. Setanta."  Dr. Eriksen said as if it were something she was proud of.

"Nox.  And I didn't do most of it."

"Then who did?"

I shrugged.  

"Who did Nox?"  She repeated herself.  I didn't answer.  I kept looking at the floor.  "Why won't you look at me?"

I grinned.  "Because you make me sick." 

The room grew quiet and I laughed.  "What I mean to say is.  The pattern around you makes me sick to my stomach.  I can't look at you without seeing it."

"I am not Magnus."  She sounded like she believed what she said.

"Whatever you say Duckling.  You are untrained and Eruditus, but you are Cesari."

Margo leaned forward, "Cesari can never be learned, Nox."

"Why not?  Dorian is close, I feel it.  I see it."  I nodded towards Dr. Eriksen, "And she is one.  There is no doubt in my mind."

"And by the way if you hadn't figure it out yet, Dorian is the one who helped me heal fast.  Until recently touching the elements has been rather painful for me.  Without Dorian I would still be in need of a bed and a wheelchair."  I kept my eyes averted the whole time we'd been speaking.  I could tell Margo was annoyed.

Dr. Wilton made a suggestion, "Can you help her with the chaotic pattern then?"

I shrugged, "If she's willing to try."

I made four balls of elements above my hands.  "Draw a colored line in  your mind from you to the ball.  You have to see it in  your head, not just say it's done.  You have to beleive it's done."

I watched from hooded eyelids and saw that her pattern was calming down.  I turned my face up to look at her directly and smiled.  "See was that hard?"

Dr. Eriksen frowned, "That could have all be a ploy."

I shrugged, "Whatever.  I don't typically lie inside these walls."

Margo nodded her agreement, "He's right, he may not give you the full truth, but he rarely lies.

I didn't care what she thought.  I rarely cared what anyone else thought anyway, why should this woman be any different.  I looked at her with indifference.  "You wanted to tell us something."

She nodded.  "I have a confession to make.  There were multiple reasons you have been placed here.  You are a danger to yourself, but we needed more time to explain what happened to you."

Dr. Eriksen took out her notes.  "When you first came to me you were on the verge of dying, every bone broken, internal injuries so severe we didn't want to operate.  But with in days you were better.  Still in a coma, but you were healing impossible wounds."

I just stared at her waiting for the ball to drop, there was some sort of catch.

There was a slight flush in the woman before me as she continued.  "The pills you have been taking have been a very specific poison."

Dr. Wilton stared at her with a slack jaw and I could see Margo ready to say something.  I stood up and reached for the door then looked at Margo.  "You will get me out of here, now."  I turned to the woman before me.  "If you don't allow Margo to sign me out of here, I will leave.  And there is nothing you can do to stop me.  I am not some guinea pig you can run experiments on.  I will see your liscense abolished."

I opened the door and slammed it behind me.  I heard a painting crash to the floor but I didn't stop walking.## One Last Night

I walked the cooridors of the pschye ward for about an hour before I found myself walking past a room just as a peircing scream let lose and a large crash followed by a scrambling orderly running out of the room.  I caught the door before it latched closed and found Jo cowering in a corner.

A voice came over the intercom, "Nox, you need to get out of there, it's not safe."

I looked up at the camera and shook my head.  "She can't hurt me.  I'm at full capacity."

"Don't be an idiot.  Get out of there."

"Sorry, can't do that."  Nox threw a wall of air in front of the door and it wouldn't open no matter how hard they tried to shove things around.

There was low rumble coming from the corner of the room where Jo huddled against herself.  I sat down in the middle of the floor and just sat there watching the small girl turn her snarling face my direction.  Her eyes had gone amber and her lip quivered as she growled.  "How has no one understood what was going on?"  It baffled me what Venatori went through to be ignorant of things.  This was clearly a case of werewolf close to the full moon.  Anger and agression, even her eyes changed colors.  People really didn't pay any attention in their classes.

I don't know how much time passed before I moved a little closer.  Jo had stopped rumbling until I'd done that.  I wove a shield of air around my body, so close it almost hurt.  I didn't want to put up a wall and hurt her but I didn't want her to bite me either.  Venatori die when bitten, it's worse than not surviving the disease.  It was like lycanthropy was designed to kill Venatori.  And I wouldn't put past whatever created us to do just that - we were immortal once.

I moved closer to Jo whenever she calmed down and understood I wasn't going to hurt her.  I don't know how long I sat there on the cold cement floor.  My legs were going numb but I was with in arms reach of her.  I reached out and touched a lock of hair that had fallen in front of her now amber eyes.  She sniffed at my hand much like a dog did and nuzzled it softly.  That was a good sign.

I moved closer and removed the barrier from my body.  I could easily defend myself but I wanted her close.  I pulled her against me and leaned against the wall.  

I could feel the sun go down and when the moon rose Jo started to whimper.  It woke me from the shallow sleep I'd drifted into.  Surprised to have driftec I was awake as I heard the first cry of pain from the girl in my lap.  I held her close as her body quaked and quivered against me.  I watched as her body transformed underneath my arms, her back arching against me and she turned over in my lap on all fours.  Her face against my neck and I started to feel panicked.  My heart started to race as the change continued.  

I don't know how long it took it felt endless as I held her and told her was going to be alright until she was lying in a large brindle fur coated wolf on my legs pressing her head against my chest.  I kissed the top of her head and she sat back and howled at the moon.

There was an howl outside the window of another's call and another.  She returned their cry and began to dance around.  She needed to hunt, but that wasn't going to happen in here.  I got up in her bed and pulled her with me, she struggled and I could feel an eager energy about her and I could see it wafting in waves around her.  I reached out and touched the patterns around her and she looked at me with curiousity in those amber eyes.  

Jo, the wolf, climbed into her bed and curled up next to me and put her head on my shoulder.  I sat there with a large wolf leaning on me until we drifted off to sleep.

I woke from a nightmare of wolves hunting my demon and ending up dead themselves.  Jo lay curled up naked laying her head on my legs.  The sun was streaming through her window up on high and I touched her shoulder tenatively.  She stirred and scrambled away from me clutching at her sheets.

I held up my hands to say I surrender, but she blushed and hurried towards her dresser gathering up clothes and tried to get out of her room.  I'd forgotten the barrier on the door and she stared at it with confusion.  "Sorry."  I removed it.  "You can go through now."

She turned with the pale sheet wrapped around her, "What happened?"

I grinned at her.  "You transformed last night."

She asked, "Why aren't you dead? Or am I not?"

"I don't know really but you trusted me, I guess."  I smiled at her.  "Things should go better now, Jo."  I stood up and straightened out my shirt and jeans before stepping up to the little wolf girl with a grin.  "I will speak with the local pack and try to find you a home here in the city.  You don't need these walls, you need a pack."

Jo still didn't look like she believed me but I'd met enough werewolves to know that a pack can do you a lot of good - much better than the mental hospital that has no idea what they are handling.

I stepped into the hall and Madison was rushing my way.  She hurried Jo into the bathroom and guided me away from her room.  "Nox, that could have gone very badly."

"I told you she wouldn't hurt me."  I walked where she guided me which was back to my room.

We stood outside my open door.  "Why were you so confident?"

"Because I'm a cocky bastard?"  I gave her that look that said I beleived it, and in a way I did.  "Because I knew she couldn't.  I'm not your run of the mill Venatori.  I could have locked my self behind walls of air, like I kept everyone out all night long even in my sleep.  But I knew she wouldn't hurt me."

"But you didn't know."  Madison sounded exasperated.  "You have a visitor."

I raised my eyebrow and stepped inside my room and grinned.  "Well Hello you." 

I heard Madison stomping off the other direction and I laughed.  Dorian smiled at  me as he turned around.  "What was she mad at?"

I grinned playfully at Dorian.  "I spent the night with a girl."

He arched an eyebrow and I laughed.  "The little werewolf transformed last night.  I kept her from hurting anyone or herself."

I saw Dorian relax as I told him about Jo.  He really had thought ... "You really thought I'd sleep with someone else?"  I closed the distance between us and stood as close to Dorian as possible.  

There was a momentary frown before Dorian spoke, "It's not as if you are the mangomous type."

I asked, "Is that what you want?"  I added, "With me?"

Dorian took a deep breath and stepped back.  "I don't know Nox.  I like this."  He waved his hands between the two of us and I smiled but I didn't say anything I'd let him continue.  "But you aren't exactly the most reliable partner.  So many hurt girls and boys from  your past and those are only the ones that were here in the Academy."

I nodded.  "You ever think it was because I hadn't found the right partner?"  I wanted to touch Dorian, but I held my ground.  "Look Dorian.  I know my past is a lot to take in, but I have no intentions of hurting you."  Dorian looked like he wanted to say something but I held up my finger asking him to wait while I finished. "I do not intend to sleep around, or tarnish your image, or anything else that might hurt you.  But I'm fallable, I will fuck up.  I do better with rules.  If there are things about my lifestyle that bother you, you need to speak up so I can adjust before they become too much."

I held my hand out palm facing up and nodded giving him the chance to talk and Dorian smiled.  "I don't know what's going to turn out to be too much Nox.  Never dated a guy like you."

I grinned at him.  "I'm improbable."  I took a step to close the distance between us but not so close I would impose upon Dorian this time like I had last time.  "If you don't know then I'll ask some questions now."  Dorian nodded.  "Do you want me to stop flirting with guys?"

He gave a slight nod and my heart sank, "Is that flirting in general or just guys?"

Dorian backed up and sat down on my bed.  "Nox.  You would stop being you to please me?"

I stood in the middle of my room and nodded, "If it bothers you that much yes."  I stepped up to Dorian and squatte down in front of him taking his hands in mine.  "I will do my best to not flirt with people.  It will be hard."

Dorian shook his head.  "I won't change a fundamental peice of your persona, that's not fair."  He smiled, "But keep the physical flirting to a minimum."

I grinned, "I will touch no one but you in any flirting manner.  I can handle that."

Dorian pulled me close and I fell to my knees and he leaned down and kissed me.  We hadn't even got started when someone cleared their throat behind me.  I knew who it was just from the singular sound.  She'd done it often enough when I was a child.  "Hi Dae'lin."

I stood up and turned around.  She handed me several folders and an envelope.  "Work for the next few weeks while you remain out of field duty.  The envelope containes your release instructions.  First and foremost, Dorian is to escort you to Dr. Silverman's office for your release consultation and go over those contents."

I nodded.  "Alright."

Dae'lin smiled past me.  "Nice seeing you Dorian."  She grinned then back at Dorian.  "You could do better than this Dorian."

Dorian chuckled.  "I'm not sure about that, Dae'lin.  He's quite the catch from what I've seen.  Even your neice seems interested."

I turned around and gave Dorian an incredulous look.  He really said that.  He really told Dae'lin that Daneilla had flirted with me.

Dae'lin sighed, "Nothing new.  She seems to have a thing for men who are so not what she needs."

"Her friend seemed to just want sex.  I hope she's careful."

Dorian stood up and wrapped his arm around me.  "Yeah she slapped him for his comment."

"Do I want to know what it was?"  Dae'lin asked.

Dorian shook his head.  "No, you don't."  

Dorian picked up my bag and handed it to me.  "Shall we leave this dreadful place?"

I nodded.  As we walked out Dae'lin joined us and I asked, "Can you get me the number for the local were wolf pack leaders here in the city?  I need to contact them.  I can call a friend, while he's an alpha he's not exactly in a pack."

Dae'lin nodded.  "I'll email the list to you."

We stopped at the front desk while Dae'lin kept on going.  I was handed yet another stack of papers to carry out.  Which Dorian took from my hands  so he could hold my hand as we exited the phschye ward and headed to Margo's office a few floors down.
