# Fear of Flying

My flight out of Denver International Airport was early but not too early at least not for me.  By the time most people's alarm clocks were going off I was already up, had a quick work out and was showered.  I had a light breakfast - completely not my usual thing consisting of cereal and milk - a sugared cereal at that.  It was all the free Continental breakfast had at this early hour that I would eat.  There was plenty of food just nothing I was overly fond of.  Things like pastries and donuts or other sugary type foods.  

But this morning was already stressful might as well add a bad breakfast to it as well.  I was thankful that my trip through security wasn't too bad well unless of course you count rude men and crying babies.  Security had a long line.  In front of me was a man wearing a fedora and a long trench-coat.  He looked like the kinda guy who you'd worry about having a bomb underneath that jacket.  But he shed it like the rest of us, hat and all and waited for his turn to place his things on the conveyor belt.

In front of him was a small redhead toting around a toddler.  The toddler wasn't happy with situation and started screaming when the woman tried to take off his shoes.  Instead of offering to help or politely waiting the man in front of me went around her - butt in front of her with a side remark.  "You shouldn't travel alone miss."

The look the small redhead gave him mimicked my thoughts exactly _How rude!_ but I didn't say anything either.  I stood behind her and watched as she struggled with the little man and he refused to be put down and she couldn't hold him.  I asked, "Do you need some help?"

The woman shook her head.  "I got this."

I couldn't help but chuckle at the irony because she clearly did not have this.  "Are you sure?"

She nodded.  "Yeah."  But she didn't sound very convincing.

I gently moved her hands from the tiny shoe and carefully untied the knotted laces that were giving a one handed momma a hard time.  The shoe slipped off quickly and she looked relieved.  "Thanks, I guess," she said to me as she placed all of her things on the belt and stepped through the medal detectors without being further assaulted.  

I didn't have the same luck.  I was randomly chosen to be searched a little more throughly, I hadn't even stepped through the metal detector when the man pulled me aside and started waving the wand over my long arms.  He was a short stocky man build like a truck.  But when the wand neared my junk I had to comment despite the beat down I was likely to get.  "Don't ya think you should be me a drink first?"

The man gave me this look that was a cross between pissed off and completely taken back.  I grinned at him.  "Sorry, man, had to lighten the mood."

The security officer rolled his eyes and went back to work.  As a parting gift he used the small want to swat my backside.  I turned around with a laugh, "Next you buy me drinks first!"

He let out a loud guffaw and went back to work.  At least some people can take a joke I wasn't always so lucky.  I'd been beat down on a regular basis because of my sexual preferences.  I'm not saying I don't like women because I do - a lot.  I just also happen to like men.  And bigotry and homophobic tendencies run high in the land of the free.  Everyone seems entitled to their right way - sure the land of the free is free but only if you are exactly like us.  Dicks!  

I knew my train of thought was only going to make shit worse when I actually got on the plane so I found a stall that sold water and I bought two bottles and a cheap magazine to read while I waited in the terminal to distract my mind.  But I can't stop being me even when I know it causes people to stair at me.  The magazine was a teeny-bopper glam magazine meant for teenage girls.  I was far from teenage and short of the eyeliner I applied everyday I wasn't really into make up.

The terminal was empty except for a one other passenger, and elderly lady with an oxygen tank sitting next to her seat.  I sat two seats away from her.  I was a social butterfly.  Jace asked me more than once, "Do you ever not talk to people?"

I could only shrug at my best friends question.  I was looking for something in someone.  I don't know what.  But I wanted people to make up their mind about me out of the gate so I could move on.  People were dicks in most cases.  They refused to talk to you or they ignored you.  Even when I didn't hit on them, they were still dicks.

I dropped the magazine in the chair between us and the woman looked down and then back up at me and I grinned at her.  "You can read it.  I'm sure a lovely young lady like yourself doesn't need any tips, but hey it can't hurt either, can it?"

The woman smiled at me and for a woman her age I was certain those were her real choppers.  I grinned at her, "Great smile."

The elderly woman turned a pretty shade of rose and waved her hand in front of her.  Bingo!  Job well done.  I added, "I'm sure all the gentleman at home notice too."

The blush deepened just as a woman sat across from us.   From the way she'd plopped down in the seat she had a rough time of something.  I beamed my best smile at her and continued with the charade, "This must be your sister."  It was likely she was her daughter or grand-daughter judging by her age, but if I were take a guess she was a spitting image of the older woman.

The elderly woman's blush was all but gone at the compliment, "Oh dear no.  This is my grand-daughter, Erin."  

"A pleasure.  Nox."  I turned back towards the elderly woman and offered her my hand, "And what may I call you other than sweet-thing?"

I gained another slight blush as the woman too my hand in hers.  "It's Erin too." 

"A pleasure, Erin."  I raised her hand to my lips and could smell the tale-tell signs of a hospital on her - she was clearly from a nursing home or a stint in the actual hospital.  I kissed the top of her middle knuckle and she pulled her hand from my light grip.

"You indulge an old lady.  You shouldn't waste your flattery on me.  My grand-daughter would be far better suited for it."  She chided.

I laughed, "Duckling, she probably hears all that all the time.  You on the other hand are a doll and I'm sure no one tells you enough."  I patted the magazine on the chair between us - tapping at the biggest article on the cover "How to be better in bed".  She glanced down at my tapping and blushed.  "I wasn't lying when I told you you probably didn't need any advice on the topic.  I'm sure you are a wild cat."

She lowered her head and I could see the rose color rising to her ears.  The younger version of her self picked up the magazine and tossed it at me.  "Leave my grandmother alone you pervert!"

Score number 2 I managed to piss off the young one.  "Pervert?  That's all you got?"

The younger Erin rolled her eyes at me and helped her grandmother stand.  "Nana, let's move over here so you can rest in peace."

I called out after them, "Ms. Erin, don't let them put you in the grave before you are ready.  We are only as old as we think we are."  I added as a second thought, "And nice ass."

I could hear the younger woman grumbling as she walked away from me with her grandmother in tow.  I listened to their conversation for a short while before I notice a small hand wiggling it's way towards the magazine.  A boy of about 3 years old was sneaking the magazine from my lap.  I looked around for his mother and found her busy trying to situated the stroller, a car seat and several small bags into a means to carrying them all and her son. 

I handed the boy the magazine and picked him up in my lap.  He turned and sat down with the magazine in his lap and flipped to the first page.  I started reading, figured that's what he wanted.  It was the Table of Contents but hey, the kid didn't care.  The moment I read the "How to be better in bed" title the redhead looked up, snatched her son from my lap and glared at me.  Her little voice squeaked before she was actually able to make any words come out of her mouth, "How dare you?  First you assault that old woman and now you assault my son - again!"

I shrugged.  "If that's how you want to see it fine by me.  But you should pay more attention to your son, he was over hear trying to take it from me."

She turned a color almost as read as her hair.  "I'm so sorry.  That was uncalled for."

"No harm no foul."  I stood up so I wasn't looking up at her, not something I enjoyed, being 6'0" I was usually the one being looked up to.  "Name is Nox.  Let me help you.  Reorganize your gear, or hold your son while you do it.  I'm getting on this plane and I'm not going anywhere until it leaves.  I give you my word."  I held up two fingers in scout's honor.  

She laughed, which was better than yelling at me.   I handed her my ticket.  "You hold this to prove I'm not going anywhere."

She looked down at it and then at her ticket in her pocket and sighed. "It seems I won't be getting away from you any this morning."  She held up her ticket and the seat was right next to mine.  

I smiled.  "I'll behave.  Promise."

I took the little boy from her hands and sat back down on my seat with the magazine in our laps and we pointed out pictures.  He was pretty good at finding even tiny little letters in the print.  A smart kid.

She started fixing her things again and then looked up at me and her son with what I could only explain as fear I had left with her son.  I smiled at her to reassure her but I doubted that would work.  She spoke to me a few moments after going back to her work.  "Stella, and that's Aidan."

I nodded.  "A pleasure.  I'd offer you my hand but it seems both of them are rather occupied."  Aidan had taken to moving my hands to open and close the magazine and he was giggling softly to himself.

Stella giggled herself and sat down across from us and watched her son play.  I spent the greater part of my wait tending to the squirming child in my lap.  I missed Jace's kids.  I was glad that he was picking me up when I landed.  It would be good to see JJ and Naya.

A woman, who was clearly a stewardess, came over to us and looked at me.  "Would you like to board first?"

I looked up and was surprised to see Cindy - a regular flight attendant on other trips out of town just not usually to New York.  She frowned and then smiled.  "I didn't know you had a son."

I laughed.  "I don't.  This is her son.  I don't want to sit on that death trap any longer than I already have to." I looked across the floor to Stella, "Do you want to get on first?  I'm pretty sure she meant to ask you."

Stella looked up at her.  "No, we'll board when he does, he's rather helpful."

I laughed. The stewardess smiled sweetly at me.  "Alright, sweetie.  I'll see you on board."  She winked at me. 

Stella was staring at me.  "Friend of yours?" she asked.

I shrugged.  "A girl I slept with."

"So you really are that playboy? You weren't just being nice to an older woman."  She sounded like that was a bad thing.

"At least you know what you get."  I said with my inflated ego voice.

Stella rolled her eyes at me as the intercom called the first rows.  "Why didn't you want to get on early?  It'd have been easier."

"Afraid of flying.  I'm putting it off as long as I can. So my anxiety doesn't spike prematurely."

Stella laughed, "Does that happen often?"

Oh I liked her.  I grinned at her.  "No.  I make sure they are satisfied before hand."

The rose color of her embarrassment rushed to her face and she took Aidan from my hands and sniffed his bottom then wrinkled her nose.  I laughed.  "That's sexy."

And I was rewarded with a deepening red as she sat her son in her lap trying to look all casual like.  But she didn't try to speak.

I winked at her.  "Come on, let's get on the plane so you can change him."

Standing up I grabbed her things and mine but Stella hesitated.  "But.."

"I'll be fine."  I offered her a hand up with a grin.  She took it carefully adjusting her son to her hip.  Her hand was warm and I could smell the sweet scent of roses as she drew near.  Aidan didn't smell like he needed to be changed to me, but then again I wasn't focusing on that.  It must be a mother thing.  

Stella had our three tickets in her hands and I had everything else except Aidan and we stood impatiently in line to get on the stupid, flying, death trap they called an airplane.  I really hated airplanes.  # Distractions

I was afraid of flying, it wasn't the airplanes fault, or the pilots.  It was my mother's fault.

I had just turned five when I was on my first flight.  It probably wouldn't have been so bad if it were not for the fact that only hours before my mother was spiting at me and calling me a monster.  And hours before that I had sparked.  I watched as a time flicker of flame caught fire on the curtains.  I remember it clear as day.

I remember that tiny little pattern coalesce and form and take light with only my thoughts to guide it.  I know it was me.  I knew then it was me.  My mother knew it was me too.  

I took a deep breath and swallowed the memory into the depths of my mind again.  I disliked thinking about her - about my mother - the woman who gave me away without a second thought.  I hated her.  I could hear Margo's words screaming back at me now.  _"You don't hate her.  You are angry.  You have every right to be but hate is a very strong word."_  It was something she said to me often when the topic of my mother came up.

There was a warm hand with rose scent wafting up from my arm that brought me back to my senses.  Stella asked, "You okay?  We are almost there."

I nodded my head.  I didn't trust my words as I shifted our things to the other side so I could get my ID out of my wallet in my back pocket.  It was a Colorado issued drivers license however I had never taken a driving test so to speak at least not in Colorado.  I had in New York City where I grew up but that was a long time ago.

The picture was a poor representation of myself but it at least looked like me.  Jace's never had, but then again he had a black eye the day he took the picture.

It wasn't the stewardess at the counter that I knew who took our tickets.  She didn't think twice about the fact that we weren't actually together.  Two separate parties but our seats were together and we looked like a happy little family, but we were complete strangers.

We walked down the narrow cat walk that connected the terminal to the airplane and I could feel my heart starting to race.  I could feel the sweat starting to form at the base of my neck.  Stella was in front of me and for that I was grateful.  She turned around to make sure I was still following and she frowned.  "You really don't like to fly do you?"

I shook my head.  "No, but I'll be fine."

Several other passengers behind us rushed passed us as we stood in the catwalk.  I drapped my arm around the tiny redhead and rubbed the little boy's shoulder and hurried us along the rest of the way.  There was no better way to do this than to just get it done.  Stella commented, "Like a band-aid."

I laughed softly, "Did I say that out loud?"

She patted my hand, "Yep."

I apologized, "Sorry.  I'll try not to let that happen again."

Stella squeezed my hand and we entered the plane single file with her things trailing behind me as I lugged everything through the narrow passage ways.  My friend greeted me at the door way and winked at me slyly.  I rolled my eyes once I was past her.  I wasn't exactly in the playing mood right now - she knew this.

Stella found our seats and stopped to set Aidan in the seat and asked, "Can I have his seat?"  

I managed to get it undone from the set up Stella had manuevered and  handed it her without knocking anyone in the head.  There were people waiting behind us to get past and I turned and apologized to them  but the were rude anyway.  I didn't hurry on principle then.

Stella got Aidan in the seat by the window strapped into his car seat and the airplane seat and she was trying to get inside the row so I could put things away.  The man behind me tried to push me and I turned and grinned at him.  "Sorry.  Women and children first."

He gave me a nasty glare.  I laughed and picked up the stroller and started to put it away in the overhead bin with the rest of our things.  I grabbed the magazine I'd bought and my earbuds from my things and sat down slowly next to Stella as she fussed with her son.  He was not happy to be strapped in from the sounds of things.

Stella busied her self with changing Aidan while we awaited on the plane. I could hear my pulse in my ears.  I knew that my palms were sweaty as I gripped the arm of the chair.  Stella patted my hand, "It'll be alright."

"It always is."  I said flatly.  "Give Aidan the magazine.  It should keep him quiet."

"He'll just eat it."  Stella said.

"No.  Trust me."

"I know my son."  I could hear the anger in her voice.

I shrugged.  "Fine."  I pulled my hand from under hears and put it in my lap and squeezed my knees instead.  I could feel the strength of my own grip and was thankful I didn't have the strength of the Venatori or I'd have bruises.

The flight attendants started their spiel and I couldn't pay attention to the words.  I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing.  This was worse than the elevators in the AU building back home.  It was a long drawn out process one I had to endure for hours.  I don't think I could actually make a flight over seas.

Stella fussed with her son over sitting still and squawking.  The plane started moving and my heart skipped a beat as I clutch my leg.  Landings and takeoffs were the worst parts.  Once the take off was complete I could zone into my headset and meditate and keep most of the anxiety at bay, but right now without the music as a distraction I was going to have issues.

A hand snuck across the chair arm and snagged the magazine.  I heard Stella, "Here.  Just stop, Aidan."  

I was too preoccuppied to notice what happened next.  The plane lifted off the ground and my stomach reeled.  I could feel it flipping inside.  I took a deep breath and held it until it hurt too much.  

Stella grabbed my hand and squeezed it and put it on the arm chair clasped under hers.  I looked over at her and notice Aidan was happily flipping through the magazine she'd taken from me.  I gave her a half smile and turned back towards the front and focused on my breathing, and not crushing Stella's delicate hand in mine. It was soft and warm.  I could smell the sweet scent of roses.  I turned my focus to the soft scent and the warmth of her hand, it helped to focus on something real - something in my control.  It was the basis of one of my anxiety rituals - five things I could see, four things I could touch, three things I could hear, two things I could smell and one thing I could taste.  

The idea of tasting pulled at more primal things inside me with a beautiful woman sitting next to me holding my hand.  I pushed away those thoughts Stella was far from my type.  Well not my type, but those I allowed myself to become involved with.  She was a mother, and likely had a significant other.  And if there wasn't, I'm not the type of guy who wants to get involved with someone who wants more than just sex.  I didn't do relationships.  I could see Margo rolling her eyes at me as I say the same thing to her.  I can feel the smack across the head from my now present father.  Don't treat women like that.  

Yet my father had more children with more woman than most Venatori.  He was a sought after sould apparently.  I was still trying to get over my past with my father.  I hated him for so many years for not being there for me.  And when I found out at my graduation from the Academy that he'd been around me my whole life.  I was pissed.  I'm still pissed.  Though Margo would remind me that I'm not angry at him.  He was a victim too.  He hadn't known about me until I knew about him.  I shouldn't blame him.

A call over the intercom brought me back to the present.  Stella squeezed my hand and I turned my attention back to her.  "You okay?" she asked.

I nodded.  "Yeah."  I squeezed her hand and pulled from of her warm grip.  "Thanks."

She smiled at me.  It was such a prett smile underneath those great green orbs.  "You should go get a drink of water."

I shook my head and pulled a bottle of water from the pocket in my cargo pants.  Stella laughed as I cracked the top and slugged back the water.

Aidan started squawking again.  I nodded, "His ears hurt."

Stella sighed and took out a sippy cup and handed it to him.  "How do you know what he wants?"

I shrugged, "Sixth sense I guess."  It was in reality.  It wasn't a gift like empathy, it was more reading body language, and understanding what the patterns around a person meant.  It was the first time that I'd actually let my mind see what it had been seeing around Aidan the whole time.  His aura, not really the psychic kind, I didn't see those, but the way the patterns moved around him I could see things I shouldn't see.  He couldn't be Venatori.  She wasn't, she was human, I could see that.  "Why are you going to New York City or is it just a stop through?"  I had a very bad feeling about this.

Stella smiled.  "Job interview."  She frowned and then looked out the window.  I didn't even want to think of what she saw but she smiled and turned back to me.  "I lost my job a month ago.  I can't seem to land another one, but my mom talked to Aidan's father who I didn't know she was talking to until recently and he's arranged for an interview in New York City at his company."

"A dead beat father?  I know that feeling."  I said without thinking.

Stella sighed, "It's not like that.  I didn't tell him.  The day I was going to tell him, he told me he didn't love me, couldn't love me and he had to go.  I forgot about what I wanted to tell him and I asked him why and he confided that he liked men."

"So you didn't tell him you were pregnant?"  I paled.  If Aidan was Minorem - half human half Venatori like he looked to be she could have died. Fuck!  She has no idea what danger she was in.  "When did he find out?"

"My mother contacted him when she found his phone number in my phone still after Aidan had been born and she was helping me out.  She called him and told him.  She said he was ready to get on a plane and wisk me away to New York but she talked him out of it.  But here I am using his so-called connections to try and get a job."  She looked out the window again. "Apparently he works at some school and is a big wig, and they are always looking for people with my skills to help with the office work."

"What company?" I asked to confirm.

"It's some subsidary of Apex Unlimited.  They are putting me up in Hotel Pennsylvania and I have an interview at their building."  She turned to me and sat up straight in her chair and asked, "You know anything about Apex Unlimited?"

"I work for them, in a round about sort of way.  A subsidary of a subsidary or something."

She asked, "Are they good to work for?"

I nodded.  "I've never wanted for anything since being with them."  Which was true.  The Venatori took care of their own.  They didn't pay well in human standards, but you were garunteed a place to live, three squares a day and all your needs tended too.  They paid you a measley stippened for your wants.  And I had been with them a long time.  I added, "The daycare system is excellent.  Provided housing is adequate.  Their cafeteria is acceptable but I prefer to cook myself."

"What do you do for them?"  Stella asked.

I didn't know if she knew anything about my world so I had to go with the half truth.  "I'm a secuirty consultant.  I travel around the country taking care of problems for them.  I'm flying back for a conference they are having this week because I have a unique view of some of the problems."

"Oh that sounds wonderful." 

I shrugged, "I suppose.  I'm a little afraid of talking in front of this crowd.  I'm not a shy person, but these people are the big wigs of everything and I'm just a little lowly field worker.  What do I know?"

Stella took my hand in hers and squeezed it.  "Apparently more than them if they asked you to speak."

I shrugged again.  Aidan crawled out of his seat and into his mama's lap and then  into mine with the magazine.  I grinned at her.  "Apparently we are talking too much."

Stella laughed softly.  "I'm sorry.  He seems to like you."

"Kids normally do."  I grinned at her.  "Something about the age difference."

She chuckled as I put my attention to the little lap stealer and his magazine.  For the next twenty minutes while drinks and snacks were passed around Aidan and I pointed and near naked women in ads and discussed the finer points of body parts.  It was entertaining to see a three year old exclaim boobies on the plane.  Stella covered her mouth in embarassement and I could only laugh.  He was going to be a breast man.

I siped at the water I'd brought with me and refused the refreshments they had provided.  Stella instead prompted me to get her a coke and she downed both of them.  I imagined that she was up late nights with her son.  Or worrying over what she was going to do with her life.

I asked.  "Do you intend to let his father into his life?"

Stella shrugged.  "I hadn't thought about it.  I suppose I should. I mean he has tried to take care of us, but I won't let him."

I nodded.  The man was at least honorable at that rate.  And it made me realize that maybe I needed to try harder with my own father.

Stella interrupted my train of thought.  "You go blank often, what's on your mind?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing.  Just reminded how similar this is to my own childhood."

"Oh?"

"My mother left me in the care of strangers when I was five.  My father didn't know I existed until I was 18.  I hated him for not being there as a child.  But it was my mother's choice to keep him out of my life even though she wasn't in it.  I was just thinking I should try harder with my own father.  It wasn't his fault."

Stella laughed.  "You are making this up to make me feel guilty."

I shook my head and stared down the aisle in front of me.  "No.  My mother spit at me and called me a monster and left me with people who could help me."

"That's horrible."  Stella sounded revolted by the thought.

I shrugged.  "Whatever."

"Have you talked to your mother since then?"  she asked.

"Twice.  Once when I was 18 when my father was introduced to me and the second time a few months later when she died."  My mother had been hunting a werebear and I was assigned the task to find it on my own and kill it.  It was part of my first hunt with my handler. My mother didn't want to give up the job so she came with us and insisted we do it her way.  So she was the first one in the werebear's cave and the first one attacked.  

She suffered massive injuries to her chest and I received a rake to the chest before I was able to kill it.  We rushed my mother to the Boulder Infirmary but she'd been bitten.  And the disease that makes a human a were creature tore my mother apart.  I watched her suffer through the window in the door because she refused my presence in her room.  I watched her die hating me.  

Stella tapped my arm.  "You did it again.  You okay?"

I nodded.  "Yeah, bad memories."

Stella squezed my arm, "I'm sorry for your loss."

I shrugged.  "I'm not."

"You can't hate your mother."

I nodded.  "I do.  She hated me.  Even in the end she hated me.  I watched her die from the other side of the door because she wouldn't let me in to her room."  I shook myself just as the seat belt light went on and we started our decent.  Just what I needed as we landed - more fucking anxiety.

# Best Friend

The landing made me sweat and my heart race as it always had, but Stella's warm hand on mine helped keep the worst of the panic attack away.  Thoughts of my mother were never good.  We waited until the plane was nearly empty before we got stood up and started gathering our things.  Aidan had passed out.  "I'll help you get to your car."

Stella smiled and nodded her thanks.  "Alright.  I appreciate it."

"No problem."  I said as we walked down the narrow passage of the airplane to the exit.  The catwalk made me just as nervous.  The long arm of steel and flooring suspended off the ground wasn't much better than an elevator if you asked me.  I took a deep breathe once we reached the terminal and I stopped at the first row of chairs and sat down for a moment to catch my breath and slow my heart rate.

Stella stood swaying next to me as she rocked Aidan's still sleeping form.  She asked, "You okay?"

I nodded and stood up.  "Yeah.  Better now.  Thanks."  I smiled at her and grabbed the stroller and unfolded it so Stella could drop the little one into it.  

He squawked a moment before he was passed out again with his little stuffed animal.  I couldn't quite make it out as Stella placed it in his arms.  It was yet another reminder of my first flight - holding on to my little stuffed Mushu and crying into his red plush fur trying not to upset my mother more.

I shook my hands and my body and we moved forward.  Stella didn't ask and I was grateful for not having to fully dredge up that memory.

We walked slowly through the cooridor of terminals in JFK's airport.  I had landed her often, but I remembered walking down the same path my first time.  Garrett houlding my hand and talking to me about what we were about to embark upon.  

I fought back the bile that started to rise in my stomach at the thought of my tormentor.  I hated him more than I hated my mother.  And for good reason.  But I shook the memories off as we reached the baggage claim area.  I expected to see Jace standing there with some stupid sign like he always did but he wasn't anywhere to be seen.  I pulled my phone out of my pocket and checked the time.  We were late - which means Jace got busy or forgot.  I would lay my bet on forgot.  It wouldn't be the first time.

Items had already started rolling around the carosel and Stella was pulling at her bags as they passed.  I stepped up beside her and helped her get the heavy bag off the belt and on to the floor next to Stella.  "What do you have in there?" I asked.  It wasn't overly heavy for me, but it was bulky and not really what I'd have brought with a child in tow, but it was the only bag other than her carryons so it was full utility it seemed.

Stella shook her head, "You've never traveled with a kid before."

I grinned.  "Can't say that I have."  My things made their way around.  One backpack filled with camping gear, the pots and pan I used out in the field were tie wrapped to their holsters for safe keeping, and my duffle full of my entire wardrobe and my life at current.  If it didn't fit in either, or my carryon backpack I didn't need it.  Was as simple as that.  My gun and survival knife were stored in a lock box in the camping bag and I had permits that said I could carry then on the plane in proper storage.  I hadn't gotten any complaints when I declared them.  I was a liscensed private invesigator among other things in order to get when I needed done - as were all hunters.  The human world was always getting in the way of things.

Stella giggled.  "Regular old grizzly adams."  She reached up and the beard on my chin.  "Though your beard could use some work."

I rolled my eyes.  "I like it like this."

Stella blushed, "So do I."  She started walking towards the car rental stands and I followed behind her pushing Aidan while she carried the suit case.  He had grabbed it on purpose.  

I stood back and waited for Stella to finish up with her rental and I looked around for any sign that my best friend would show up.  I didn't see him.  I pulled out my phone and dialed his number.  The phone rang for half a ring before I heard, "Fuck! I'm sorry."

I laughed.  "You forgot - again?"

"Yeah man.  Sorry.  I'll be there in an hour can you hold tight."  Jace sounded rushed and I knew he'd not be here in an hour.

"Nah.  I'll just take a cab."  

Stella stood next to me. "No you won't.  I'll drop you off anywhere you want.  It's the least I can do."

I smiled at her then I heard Jace, "Did you pick up a girl?"

I laughed.  "Not so much as picked up as she helped me through the flight."

I heard Jace groan on the other side.  "Dude, you better pay her back real well."

I smiled.  "I think we are even man.  I'll call you later, let you know the plan."

"Alright dude, but Mia expects you at the house tonight."

I nodded.  "I know.  I'm looking forward to it.  Can't wait to see Naya and JJ.  And Mia.  You I'm mad at."

Jace barked a laugh.  "Fair enough.  I'm sorry man. Really.  We'll be leaving her around 5pm so call before then."

"Alright, Jace.  Love ya babe."

"Love ya too.  See ya soon."  Jace hung up the phone and Stella was looking away.

"Babe? Your boyfriend?" She asked.  She looked a little down

I shook my head.  "My best friend.  Just a term of endearmant we toss around.  Use to be to make people uncomfortable, now it's just habit."

"And you love him?" Stella seemed a little taken back by my exchange of words.

"He's like a brother to me.  Yeah. I love him."  

"Oh."  Stella stammered without really wanting to say what she wanted, I could hear it in her voice.

"Now you are questioning things?  About me?  And Jace?"  I leaned down and whispered in Stella's ear.  "I like men, yes. But I also like women."

"Oh."  Her voice rose up in a cresendo and I knew I had taken her off guard by telling her what she had been wondering.

I grabbed the baggage handle before Stella could and hoisted my dubble on my shoulder and said, "Lead the way."

Stella sighed. "Alright."  I followed the short little red head to the SUV they had rented for her.  It was a safe enough model.

She packed her things in first then I set mine in behind her minus the bag I'd brought on the plane with me.  Stella handed me Aidan as she finished putting the stroller in then moved to the passenger side rear seat and started strapping in the car seat.  I watched as she worked.  She'd done this many times from the look of it.  It made me wonder what kinda guy doesn't step up to a girl like this.  I urked me a bit.

Aidan was groggy in my arms and laying his head against the crock of my neck and humming to himself as I rubbed his back when Stella turned around with a smile.  "I've never seen him take to anyone like you."

I grinned.  "I told you it's the relative age distance."

She strapped Aidan in and I climb into the passenger side.  I had no problems letting a woman drive.  As long as I wasn't driving in New York City I was happy.# Hotel Penn

We chatted on the short route to the LIE and on our way into the city.  I asked, "Where did they put you up?"

Stella nodded towards the GPS display on the dash.  "Hotel Pennsylvania."

I whistled.  "Posh.  Your ex must have some pull."

Stella shrugged.  "I dunno.  Why is it fancy?"

I nodded.  "Yeah, fancy is a word for it."

"How far is it from the building?"  Stella asked.

"About a 15 minute walk.  You can catch a train and make it in half that.  But really no point in it."

"So I really don't have to drive too far to drop you off." Stella seemed surprised.

"You can take me to the hotel.  I'll walk from there."  I would enjoy the walk.  I hadn't walked in my home town in many years.

"No.  I can drop you off, it'll let me see the building."

"I'd rather walk."  I insisted.  "Walking is good, it'll give me time to think."

"You need time to think?"  Stella asked.

"Always.  It's Sunday and I have a big presentation tomorrow.  I will miss my weekly check-in with my therapist and that's going to throw a whole new kink into the works." 

"Your therapist?"  Stella giggled.  "Your dad trying to straight you out?"

I shook my head.  "No, ma'am.  I've been in therapy since I was six.  The drama with my mother was only worsed by a year of ... well not so good treatment.  There was an accident and to insure it was really an accident they had me in pschye eval for a while.  I've continued the sessions because the PTSD and the OCPD never really went away.  I cope and manage everyday."

"Sounds rough.  Any other acryonyms you want to toss out there?"

I laughed.  "None that need to be said."

She grinned at me.  "So you have someone back home?"

I turned to look at the little red head driving.  "Are you asking me if I have a girlfriend?"

Stella blushed answering my question without answering.

"No.  Nor do I have a boyfriend.  I don't do relationships.  But for the record, this is home.  There is work."

Stella frowned.  "What are you a monk?  'I don't do relationships.'"  She laughed but it wasn't an I find you humorous laugh it was nervous and worried.

I leaned back in my chair.  "No, not a monk or celabate.  I've had plenty of sexual partners since I was 13 years old.  Just no relationships."

"That sounds lonely."  Stella sounded sad.

"Maybe.  But no one can hurt you if you don't let them in."  I said as I stared off into the distance watching the city draw near.

"That sounds really lonely."

I shrugged and we rode the rest of the way in silence.

Stella pulled up into the parking garage nearest the hotel and parked her rental car and got out and started to pull out our things from the back.  I got out slowly.  I had not intended to sleep with her, but now that I was fairly certain that particular card was off the table I was wanting to persuade her to let me into her bed.

I heard a squawk from the back seat and opened the rear door I had just passed and unbelted Aidan and shifted him to my hip and he clung to me like he was used to doing it.  His head was leaned against my shoulder and his little hand played little circles on my shoulder blade.  

Stella looked up and smiled shaking her head.  I asked, "What?"

Stella handed me my duffle bag and gear bag and took her son fro me.  "Nothing.  You look good with kids."

I grinned at her.  "Thanks."  But the reminder that she had a son had tempered my prior emotions.  I was okay with that which was odd.  "I'll help you inside if that's alright?"

Stella nodded.  "I'd like that.  I think Aidan would too."

We walked to the hotel which was across the street and down the block.  Stella hadn't wanted to use valet, something about not feeling right.  We got to the door of the hotel and the door man kindly opened it up and I followed Stella inside to the desk.  A bell hop brought a cart over and I set Stella's things on it and he stood there waiting for room number and information.  

The woman at the desk was a pretty blonde and I smiled at her as I stood behind Stella waiting for her to get through.  She turned and handed me a squirming Aidan, "Can you hold him while I do this.  He's being a worm."

"Sure." It wasn't like I had a choice in the matter she'd pretty much thrust him in my arms to begin with.  I tickled the little man in my arms and he giggled and squrimed until his mother returned pulling him gently from my arms.  

Stella looked at the bellhop and handed him a ten and said, "503."  He nodded and started for the elevator.  Stella looked at me with a grin.  "Do you want to come up?"

I looked at my phone for the time and decided that I did have time.  But I said, "I really shouldn't."  What the fuck was I doing, turning down this girl.

She smiled at me.  "Please?  You can tell me more about Apex Unlimited and we can order in while Aidan takes a nap.  I could use the company."

I looked at my phone again hoping that I could find some way out of it but there was nothing.  "Alright, I have time before Jace leaves.  I'll have him pick me up here."

We approached the elevator and I had to swallow hard as I stepped into the small cramped space with the bellhop cart, and two other adults inside.  I closed my eyes and clutched the metal rail.  Stella placed her warm hand on top of mine, "Don't like elevators either?"

I shrugged.  "I don't like heights at all."

I could feel the small woman step closer to me and pressed her leg against mine and Aidan climbed into my arms.  I had no other choice but to wrap my arm around him and around Stella's shoulder.  She settled against me with ease and I could feel the all to familiar tightness increase.  I thought to myself _I don't do relationships that's what she wants._

By the time the elevator stopped my heart was racing for more than one reason.  I was the last one off the elevator I followed Stella and the bellhop to her room and I was ready to leave.  I had to leave before she got the wrong impression.

Stella opened the door and the bellhop took our things into her room.  I took a deep breath and stepped inside.  The room was lavious and smelled clean.  I found no hints of any other odors not even the scent of cleaning fluid.  It was perfect.

I looked around while Stella unpacked.  I set Aidan down and he squawked and bounced with his hands in the air.  "Up," he demanded.

I lifted the little boy back up and moved to sit down on the couch.  He slayed himself on top of me and was soon snoring softly against my shoulder.

Stella smiled as she came and gently lifted him from me and took him to the play pen she'd set up.  I noticed a small patch of drool on my shirt.  It wasn't the first time, and it wasn't likely the last but without Aidan to create a buffer I was feeling axious.  And I don't get anxious around girls - even pretty ones.

Stella sat down next to me and I pulled my phone out I had to call Jace or I'd forget.  He picked up the phone quickly.  "Already?  Damn you are fast."

I laughed.  "Can you pick me up at Hotel Penn on your way home?"

I pulled the phone away from my ear and glanced at the time.  I still had time.  My hearts started to race faster.  Fuck.  

Jace answered.  I'd missed part of it, but I got the part I needed.  "I'll be there at 5pm sharp.  Don't be late."

"I'll be the one outside with my leg showing."

Stella giggled.  

Jace laughed.  "Don't do anything I wouldn't do."

"Bye Jace."

We hung up and Stella reached down and pulled my pant leg up.  She sighed.  "I thought you might have shaved."

I rolled my eyes.  She ran her fingers under my eyes, "I mean you do wear make up and all."

Again I rolled my eyes.  She had manuevered herself to her knees and was too close.  And the look in her eyes said more than words every could.  And I had enjoyed her touching me.  All day she had been touching me and I had enjoyed her soft rose scent and her warm touch.  I missed the touch of others.  I had been out in the field too long alone.

A small sigh escaped as her fingers played with the hair behind my ear.  She was flirting and she knew the reaction she was getting from me.  I said in a low husky voice filled with the lust I was feeling, "I don't do relationships."

She whispered, "I know," in my ear.  I could feal her silky breath on my skin.

"You aren't typically my type."

She pulled back and slapped me upside the head, "And what type is that?"

I sighed.  Fucked that up again.  "A single mother.  A mom with a toddler to look out for."

I stood up and took a step back from the couch.  "Stella, I have rules.  I don't sleep with married individuals.  I don't sleep with anyone who may want more out of me than just sex.  I don't do relationships."

Stella stood up and stepped closer to me and looked up.  "You sure know how to kill the mood.  What if I just wanted sex?"

I smiled down at her and took another step back.  "I'd have to ask you why?"

Her face turned red.  "I need a reason to want sex?"  She was angry now.

"Well.  No."  She advanced on me and I took a step back for every step she took towards me until her hands balled up in a fist and my back hit the wall.  Fuck.  A gear in my head slipped and I could feel the panic and the fear rising up.  I tried to explain myself but nothing coherent came out of my mouth.  "I...Um.."

Stella stood inches from me with her fists balled up and staring up at me with fury.  "Spit it out."

As commanded I spoke cleanly and clearly in the voice I hadn't heard in a long time.  "You don't need a reason, but I wouldn't think a parent like you would want a casual relationship around your son.  One based on sex and sex alone.  As a single parent I'd hope your priority was your son."

The anger rose in her and then as she looked at me pressed against the wall in fear she frowned and stepped back.  I felt a little lighter but the panic still coursed through my veins.  The fear was riding my mind and I was truly afraid of the little red head in front of me.  She cocked her head at me and sighed as she sat back down. "You really are messed up aren't you?"

I stayed pressed agains the wall only relaxing enough to shake my hands out.  "You have no idea."

Stella sat on the couch and wrung her hands in front of her.  "I'm sorry."  Her voice had cooled dramatically the prickling against my skin lessened and relaxed a little.  "Aidan liked you.  I liked you."  She turned a shade of crimson just slightly lighter than her hair.  "I figured if you were a player at least I could feel..."  She stammered.  "I've not been with anyone since Aidan's father left me."

I didn't know what to say.  So I apologized.  "I'm sorry."  I sighed.  "It's not that I don't want to.  God, I want to.  But you have a son." I took a step from the wall and then another until I was standing behind the couch Stella was sitting in.  "I don't want you to find what you are looking for in me.  I'm not the kinda guy who's going to stick around.  You need that guy.  Not me."

Stella continued to look at the floor.  I took a deep breath and bent over Stella's small form then kissed the top of her head.  I could smell the sweet scent of roses and I could feel that small tightening in my body again.  I whispered against everything my body was telling me.  "I'm going to go now."  

I took a card out of my wallet and set it on the table near the door.  "Call me after your interview, let me know how it went.  If you move here maybe I can show you around.  Have a play date with Aidan."  I grinned at her.

Stella looked up at me with tears in her eyes.  Fuck!  I hated crying, I was weak when girls cried.  But she smiled at me.  "I'd like that.  See ya round Nox."

"See ya round, Stella."  I opened the door and hefted my things to my shoulder and I headed for the nearest stair well.  It was no where near time for Jace to pick me up.  I'd tell him I was stopping back at HQ and find my new room to stop by there.  But first I had to get as far away from the prickling fear that was chasing me down the stairs.
# Proposition

I dropped my gear off in my crap room.  It was a simple studio apartment layout with a small kitchenette, with two person table, a tv on the wall and a queen sized bed.  Everything in the room was beige - the most boring color in the world.  I had called Jace and he said he'd meet me here.  He wanted to know what happened, but I didn't want to talk about it. 

There was a knock on the door and I quickly answered it with my duffle bag and carry on from the plane in my hand.  It wasn't Jace.  It was a pretty little brunette with little red gem in the center of her head - one of our Indian natives it appeared.  Like humans the Venatori tended to pick up nationalities and heritages akin to the humans.  There was only one Indian family that I knew of which meant that this little fox was a Dowager.

"How can I help you Ms. Dowager?"  I asked.

"Oh, you know who I am?" she asked.

I shook my head.  "No, ma'am, just a guess."

"Oh.  Well I was told you were coming to town.  I have a proposal for you.  If we can talk in private."  

She was very confident I would say yes so I stood in the door way and said, "I've been back a few hours and already getting hit up with offers of breeding?"

She blushed.  "I'm sorry, but I wanted to be the first."

I sighed then stepped aside.  Come on in."

I dropped my bags at the door as she sat down at the table delicately.  I searched in my cupboards for glasses and found two and poured two glasses of ice water from the fridge and set one down in front of Ms. Dowager.  "I'd offer you something else but I just got in."

"Where you going somewhere?"  she asked nodding to my things.

"To my best friends place for a home cooked meal and some family time."  There was no reason to lie to her.

"I won't keep you long." she said.

I sat down across from her and leaned back against the back and waited for her to continue but she sat and watched me sipping at her water. "Your proposal?"

She nodded.  "I was just examining your features."

"Like cattle.  Thanks."  The sarcasm dripped like honey from my mouth.  I hated being treated like I was nothing more than breeding stock.

"Apologies.  I didn't mean to offend you."  She seemed sincere.  "I'm here to offer you my daughter."

"And what does she think on the matter?"  I asked. I wasn't exactly thrilled with pre-arranged marriages much less pre-arranged sexual partners.

"She asked me to speak to you on her behalf.  She just graduated from the Academy.  Your name has been floating about Academia and the Scrin.  And we beleive your line would be a great addition to our own."

"You do realize I am half human?"

She nodded.  "We are aware.  We have taken that into consideration.  The pure bloodline isn't a determinantal factor in this case.  You are Cesari.  The probability of Magnus is far greater than the small loss of potential ability.  You do not have Venatori speed, strength or agility if I'm to understand correctly.  But you possess our keen senses and from Ms. Rivera's report our senses are sometimes keener than our own.  You have an exceptional healing ability as we do despite being half human.  The lost abilities aren't a concern for a Scrin."    She was highly informed about me.

"And what do I get out of this?"  These things usually benefited all parties.

"Well.  An improved status.  A child to raise without interference with one exception."

"You mean your daughter doesn't want to raise her own child?"  I was shocked.

"You are correct.  Anabel doesn't wish to be a mother, but she wishes to remove her obligation to the Venatori as quickly as possible."  She sighed.  "We only want the child to be Scrin."

"I won't force my children one way or the other.  I can guide them in a particular direction but it is their choice not mine."

She sighed.  "The first child would be ours.   The second your line.  Both raised by you, two years apart."

"I see you have this all figured out.  What makes you think I want to raise children?"  I wanted to know why they thought this was compensation for my genes.

She smiled at me.  "I am aware of your issues with children raised by the community.  I don't expect you would let your children be raised by us as anymore than your father would."

"You know my father?"

"Of course.  Kai Viddens is a good friend."

"The two of you put this together then?"  I knew my father would interfer with my life.

She shook her head.  "No.  We did discuss you but I only did so because it was what my grandmother wanted.  Tradition between families."

"How long do I have to think about this?"

Ms. Dowager stood up and pulled a card from her small glittery handbag.  "You can call me anytime with your answer.  It is a good proposition, Master Sétanta."

I nodded and took the card.  "It is but I want to do my due dillenge as you have apparently done yours."

"Fair enough."  She headed for the door and smiled.  "A true Scrin.  You would definitely find a home among us if you so choose to chase the knowledge."

I laughed.   "I don't think I would be a very good scholar."  I walked her to the door and kissed her hand good-bye.  "It was a pleasure, Ms. Dowager.  I will be in touch."

Down the hall I heard a throat clear and I turned to see Mia Hill standing there in her pixie cut brown hair and a pair of holey jeans.  I laughed.  "Can't you find pants without holes?  I'll have to speak with Jace about upping your allowance."

Mia hugged me then stepped inside my room grabbed my bag and I picked up my duffle and shut my door behind me.  "I missed you Nox."

"I missed you too Mia.  Can't wait to have you cook for me."

Mia grinned back at me.  "Ditto.  I got dinner, you get breakfast."

I nodded.  "Sounds like a deal".# Family Time

Mia took the elevator and I went with her in the plate glass elevator.  She wasn't even tall enough that I could easily hide my fears against her body like I did with her husband.  But she wrapped her arm around my waist and leaned her body against mine - a comforting support hug.  I adored Mia.  She took care of me better than Jace did.  I was more than happy when Jace finally popped the question.

We'd known Mia for years upon years.  She was a year younger than us in the Academy and she ran in the same circle as us outside in the human world.  She like me was raised by the community.  Her parents were from way out west - Hawaii and couldn't live in New York as they ran the island's Venatori contingent.  And who wants to give up their post when your daughter becomes Magnus.  She didn't spark, but the ability came young and she's been her two years less than Jace and I.

She used to hate me.  Which meant she hated Jace.  That was until we ran into her in the same forbidden circles of the human world doing things her parents wouldn't be proud of.  We struck up a friendship and she of all things asked Jace out.  I was never jealous - Mia was never more than a friend to me.  Though we had shared a few moments of pleausre together though the circumstances were not something that we discussed at all.  

Mia squeezed my waist and brought me back to the real world.  "What you thinking about?"

I grinned.  "You and Jace.  How we met."

"Ah.  No wonder the litle drool coming out of your mouth."  I heard the humor in her voice but I had already reached up and wiped the non-existant drool from my mouth.  "Got you. Next floor we get off on.  We can take the stairs after that."

"Okay."  I straighted up and wrapped an arm around Mia's shoulders as she still clung to my waist for comfort.  "Jace is a lucky man."

Mia laughed.  "He is.  Isn't he?  Got me for a wife and you for a best friend.  Can't ask for anything better."

"I was talking about you, but yeah I guess he's got it made now.  Two perfect children, a loving wife, a best friend who's like his brother and house out in the suburbs."

"You sound almost jealous, Nox."  Mia pulled away and took a step back as the bell dinged open on our floor.

We walked down the Academy's lowest level where the day care facilities are and headed for Naya's class first.  I managed to say.  "I am, actually," just as Naya burst out of her class room with the other kids.  She skidded to a hault when she saw me standing there and walked casually up to her mother and gave her a hug.

"Hi Mom."  Mia nodded with a whisper, "Go ahead."

She didn't walk to me - she ran the few steps it took to get to me and jumped into my arms.  "Uncle Nox."

"Hey babe."  She wrapped her arms around my neck and squeezed tight.  I shifted her so she wouldn't be knocking my duffle bag into me the whole time and she settled into me like an old rag doll as we went to go get JJ.  

The toddler aged children were another cooridor over and JJ was happily playing with his friends until his mother gave a little whistle and his ears perked up.  His head lifted over the half wall separating the toys from the classroom and he hurriedly put his toys away when he saw me holding his sister.  If there was anything that boy hated it was sharing hugs with me.  

JJ didn't even bother with a Hi Mom as Naya had. He walked straight up to me.  He punched me in the thigh and Mia scolded him.  "We do not hit Jason Hill Junior.  You know this, even if it is Uncle Nox and he deserves it."

She winked up at me.  "Now because of that you don't get to see him until we get home."

I leaned my head back fighting the urge to say something but this was her son.  And I had no say in the matter.  She was right - no hitting, but I didn't even get a hug from the little man.

JJ startd crying as Mia hoisted him up on her hip with my backpack and we started walking towards the stairs.  "We can take the elevator, Mia.  It'll be easier."

Mia sighed with relief, I could see it written all over her face.  JJ was not making it easy.  Once in the elevator Mia had a private conversation with JJ in the corner.  I leaned against the wooden rail and buried my face in Naya's hair.  It smelled like lavendar which I knew both the younger the Hill's hair did.  It was something Mia did to calm them in their evening baths.  It was a calming scent though not enough to completely remove the anxiety from the elevator.  

Naya whispered in my ear.  "I got you, Uncle Nox.  Nothing to be afraid of."

I grinned across at her.  "Thanks babe."

Another group of parents got in the elevatore a floor down.  A small voice spoke up to us.  "Hi Naya."

Naya scrambled down from my embrace and stood a little under that little girl.  "Hi Cat."  Naya looked nervous.  

The little girl asked Naya, "Is this the boyfriend you are always talking about?"

I raised my eyebrow and Naya blushed.  But she didn't confirm nor deny the fact.  Not good.  What had she been saying?  I looked to Mia and she mouthed, "This is your fault."

I sighed and nodded.  It was.  I flirted with Naya as I flirted with everyone else.  Mia and Jace hadn't said anything when she was younger and once she got older it was difficult to stop.  I would fix this though.

The little girl continued to bully Naya.  "Isn't he a little old for you, what's he like 20?"

Twenty was old?  Damn, kids these days.  Naya was about to say something when I put my hand on her shoulder.  I knelt down and was eye level with both the girls.  "I'm twenty -nine thank you very much.  And I'm not Naya's boyfriend.  I'm her uncle."  I waved my hand in front of the girls and a small ball of fire winked into existance.  The little girl paled.

Naya spoke, "I told you he was good."  She sounded more cocky than I did.  Naya waved her hand like I had and a smaller version of the fireball winked into existance above her palm.  "I have the best tutor in the world."

The little girl stammered and sputtered.  "Mine is better."

Naya laughed.  "Highly doubtful.  Is he Cesari too?"

I stood up and let the fireball wink out as I covered her hand and extinguished Naya's too.  "Okay that's enough.  I am not some thing you brag about Naya."

I looked across at the other parent.  The little girl giggled, "That's my Nanny. She won't say anything to me."

I grinned.  "Please turn around ma'am."  The woman grinned and did as I asked.

I didn't touch the little girl but I flared my power around me and she felt the soffocating pressence.  "You bother Naya again and you will have to deal with me."

The little girl's eyes were wide with fear.  I could smell the aweful stench on her.  On everyone in the elevator.  The elevator dinged on the bottom floor and I pushed Naya ahead of me out the door - Mia followed.

It took me a few moments to reign in my presense.  It was a trick I'd learned so I didn't stand out.  Most Magnus didn't have that control.  But when control is beaten into you as a child you tend to remember such lessens.

Mia took a deep breath.  "Jesus, Nox."

"I'm sorry."  I really was I hadn't meant to scare them too.

JJ giggled, "That was awesome."

I gave him a half grin while we waited for Jace in front of the statue they had nicknamed Atlas.  I had created it when I was 10 - proving to the world that I was Cesari.

Naya asked, "Did you really make this, Uncle Nox?"

Mia nodded, "He sure did.  It was one of his greatest acheivements."

I smiled at Mia.  It wasn't an acheivement I was doing what I was told - art.  I didn't know that what I had done was near impossible - working all four elements at the same time.  Everything but the ants and the grass seeds I had created from nothing.  The large globe above his head was it's own little world.  I had applied our life cycle science to the globe - the greenhouse effect to make a completely isolated world inside the globe.  It sustained itself year round without any interference and it had for the past 19 years.

Jace came up and stopped before me and frowned, "Why do you feel so much more powerful right now?"  He looked at me with a disapproving glare, "What did you do?"

Naya stepped between me and her father with her hands on her hips.  "He was standing up for me."

"Cat?"

She nodded.  "She was picking on me about Uncle Nox."

I sighed.  "Which you need to stop calling me your boyfriend Naya."  I turned her around and knelt down.  "I love you.  You know this.  But you are my family.  That is what I am."

She looked hurt and I didn't blame her I had no tact.  Jace put his hand on his daughters shoulder, "You'll learn to live with it."

My heart sank.  He knew all too well the feeling of loving me without my feelings returned in the same way.  When we were younger Jace had wanted more.  More than just the friendship we had shared.  More than the shared experiences.  More than I could give him.  He was my brother, my family.  My only connection to the world that made life worth living.  He eventually understood why I couldn't be more.

Mia put her hand on my waist and guided me towards their car.  She walked slower than the others, Jace had taken JJ and my bag from her and was walking at a rather fast pace with Naya chattering away at him about what I'd done.  Mia spoke softly, "He understands yu know?"

I nodded.  "I know, but it doesn't hurt any less for either of us."

Mia sighed, "If you'd been with him, Nox.  He wouldn't be with me - not ever."

"I know that too.  You are one reason.  I'm the main one though."  I sighed.  "I do love him.  And it's not that I'm not attracted to him."

"He knows.  You come up often after you've been gone a long time.  And not during sex or afterwards.  Just randomly he'll curl up against his pillow away from me.  And when I ask him what's wrong - he just misses you.  Misses having you around.  You are staying for a while right?"  Mia sounded concerned, "He really needs you."

I nodded.  "That's the plan."  I stopped and turned towards Mia.  "I want to start my own family.  I want what ya'll have."

Mia's face lit up like a beacon.  "That's wonderful Nox."  And it fell nearly as fast.  "That means you have to let someone in."

"Yeah.  I'm thinking kids will be easier.  I've already been propositioned once and I'm assuming there will be more who want a possible Cesari in their bloodline."  I truly hated the world I lived in sometimes.  But it is what it is.

"Wow.  That was fast.  Who?"

"The Dowager line - Anabel's mother specifically came to me about her daughter."

"I know Anabel.  She's a sweet girl.  Heading off to nursing school like I did."

"I haven't given her an answer yet.  I want to do some digging."

Mia laughed.  "Of course you do."

We reached the car.  Naya and JJ were already inside.  But Naya was bouncing around the seat.  "I better get in before she hurts herself."

Mia nodded.  "They love having you here Nox."

"I know."  I got in and sat in the middle seat.  It was uncomfortable but I got to see both kids and they were more than happy to have me sitting there.  Which made it all that better.

Jace drove home and the adults up front held their own private conversation while I chatted with the kids.  I found out JJ was being a bully so we had a deep discussion about what being a better person meant.  I don't think he got it.  But I think he at least understood some of what I said to him.

Naya on the other hand was the one being bullied and I showed her how to do what I'd done.  To be threatening without actually threatening.  Her power was still new to her, but she was learning quickly.  Jace looked at me and gave me a frown in the rear view mirror.  I was teaching his children things he'd rather not have them know.  But what was done was done.  You don't unforget knowledge quite so easily.

The kids ran inside carrying my bags and Mia followed them inside.  "Dinner will be ready in an hour, you two."

We both nodded, "Yes ma'am" I said and Jace shook his head.

"You really shouldn't teach my kids that stuff."  Jace sighed, "JJ's already doing things we think he saw from you."

"Like what?"

"Viels in particular."  Jace said.  "He's always hiding things so we can't find them."

"On purpose?"  I asked.

"He says no, but..."  Jace trailed off rubbing the stubble at his chin.

I grinned at him.  "I can help with that.  I doubt he knows what he's doing.  It's an easy trick to learn and to not know you are doing it.  I did."

Jace nodded.  "You didn't specifically show him did you?"

I shook my head.  "Not on purpose anyway." I removed my personal veil I usually kept up and Jace nodded.  "Something I do out of habit."

Jace sighed, "I don't know why you just don't get those scars taken care of."

"That would make people ask questions.  Questions I don't want to answer."

Jace shook his head.  "I don't know why not.  Everyone who's seen them would love to know the truth."

"Noone would beleive me anyway."  I headed for the door.  "I'm going for a swim."

"It's like 50 out."  Jace called after me shutting the cargo door in the SUV.

"I can fix that, remember?"

I went for a swim and the kids splashed around in the pool with me.  Dinner was roasted chicken covered in herbs and a decadant lemon sauce with mashed sweet potatoes and a healthy serving of wild rice.  One of my favorite dishes Mia knew how to cook.  We chatted through dinner - school projects, me being home indefinately.  Mia offered me a place on her couch whenever I wanted.

The kids were sent to their rooms for homework and lessons and I went for a run. 

By the time I got back the kids were in bed and Mia and Jace were settling in themselves.  I took a shower then laid down on the couch.  I had an early morning.  I wasn't looking forward to getting up in front of smart people to talk about my theories.  Theories I could only bet the would laugh at.# Morning Ritual

My night started as any other - darkness.  The darkness filled with a red eire glow as my demons approcahed in the depths of my mind.  I could feel the tension rising.  I felt the air around me thicken as I was pushed against the wall that had not been there before.  

A flicker of light like lightning outside a window but no thunder followed changed the scene.  The darkness was replaced with billowing smoke that made it hard to breathe.  Shadows moved in the smoke but I couldn't make anything out yet - but I knew what they were. 
Tentacles of earth, air, fire and water slipped and slide over the surface of the earth as the red glow formed into a set of eyes glowing in the smoke.  I would never fully see the figure that tormented my dreams though I knew who it was.  I have always known.  

One tentacle of air reached me and I flinched in the glow of it's aura.  I could see the pattern that made it whole and I froze on instinct.  It slashed at my shirt and it fell to the ground in shreads.  The bile and the fear rose in my stomach I wasn't sure what was worse the nausea or the fear - both a product of my anxiety and nightmares.  My heart raced inside my chest.  It felts like it was trying to escape.  I wish I could escape.

A voice echoed in my head.  "There is no escape."

There were tentacles all around me and when the first lashed out I felt my skin flay.  The second and the third went deeper and I felt my skin knitting back together but the onslaught of the demon's tentacles left my back a bloody mess.  The glowing eyes moved closer, and with all the elements at once one final strick broke my silence and I bit back my scream falling.  I never fell...

I landed on the floor between the coffee table and the couch I had made my bed.  My back ached and my lip felt swollen.  I rolled on to my back and I could feel the wounds healing even know.  I touched my lip with one hand and pulled away blood, but the ache was slowly disappearing from there as my body healed itself.  

My back was a bloody mess.  Which meant that couch and floor would now carry stains of my blood.  Fuck!  How was I going to explain this to Mia.

A groggy figure stood above me and I frowned.  Mia asked, "You okay?"

I shook my head.  "Nightmares."

Mia frowned.  "I heard."  A small ball of illumenscent light formed over Mia's hand as she looked at the couch.  "That'll come out.  Let me see."

I didn't move but Mia stepped around the coffee table and knelt down before me and lifted my shirt.  "It's mostly healed now.  Nox, what's going on?"

I shrugged.  "I'm home."

Mia grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me around violently.  I fell backwards trying to scramble away.  Mia lifted her hands away from me.  "I'm sorry.  Talk to me."

"The first night home is always the worst."  I said in a small voice which made me think of the first time it had happened.  I was so scared, in so much pain as my body healed itself from self inflicted wounds.  

"What's going on?"  Mia whispered as she started crawling towards me.  I didn't move, she wasn't adding to the terror coursing through my veins.  She wrapped her arms around me and held me tight.  I collapsed into her embrace like a small child.  Mia was careful not to touch my back.

"Don't worry about it.  I'll talk with Margo soon."

"Come to bed, Nox.  We'll keep you safe."  Mia stood up and offered me a hand.  I turned and took it without thinking.  It had been a long time since I'd shared their bed and even longer in a platonic fashion.

Mia lead me by the hand to her bedroom and opened the door quietly and we slipped inside.  Jace was lying near the side of their king side bed.  Mia walked over and shoved him over he grumbled but he moved.  "What?" he said groggily.

"Nox had a nightmare."

Jace's eyes popped open and he move to the middle of the bed.  Mia crawled over him and laid down and drapped her head on his shoulder.  "I shouldn't"  I said.  "I will only wake up again."

Jace tossed the edge of the covers over and patted the bed next to him.  "We'll keep you safe, Nox.  Come on."

I sighed.  It was a lie, there was no safety in my dreams.  But the gester was nice.  I laid down next to Jace and stared up at the ceiling before Jace was tugging at me to join them.  I laid down next to him and felt the familiar warmth of his body against mine.  When were were kids he often slept in my bed.  It was like a comforting blanket I had forgotten.  Jace rolled on to his side away from me and I curled up against the length of his body and he Mia's.  My hand drapped over his hip and I felt Mia's underneath my hand.  I moved it aside but she grabbed it and pulled it over both of them.  She held my hand and I drifted off into the blackness again with ease.

The darkness wrapped itself around me.  A chaos of patterns bloomed in my vision.  Reds and greens shifted in swirls of Christmas vomit as the yellows and blue made horrid shades of green as they mixed and mingled.  Patterns became abstract like I was living in a world made by Picaso.  Fires started in every creavice of my mind.  Little children danced in bonnets and bayonets.  One flaying the other before there was nothing but puddles of blood sifting through the kalidescope of colors.

And then it was black again.  The shifting colors were there covered in darkness.  Things would bump against my extremedies.  The cool breeze blew against my skin and it felt plesant until it became ice cold and my skin froze in ribbons. 

The fires from before burned through the darkness until I saw nothing but the flickering flames and I felt their red hot heat through my dreams.  I could feel the sweat beading on my brow.  I wipes my hands across my forehead and they came back blood red.  I was too distracted by the red on my hands to notice the red eyes coming near and when I looked up I saw my nightmare face to face.  His eyes were no longer red and glowing but the amber brown I remember them to be.  He smiled down at me like days of old.  I tried to get away.  

I started awake as my shoulder fell.  My heart was racing.  And my shoulder ached from the fall to the floor but I didn't bother getting up.  Jace was looking over the edge, "You wouldn't wake up."

"Sorry." I stayed flat on the floor while Jace climbed to the other side of the bed and started getting ready.  I could hear his movements towards the shower without another word. 

Mia whispered, "Will he be alright?  Why don't you go help him?"

Jace gave her a quiet laugh.  "He doesn't want my help.  He never does.  Just leave him be, he'll get up once the panic has been righted.  Trust me, I know Nox."

Mia sighed, and in a raised voice meant for me, "You got breakfast still?"

I took a deep breath and sat up.  "Yeah I got it." 

I was up and moving out the door when Mia shook her head, "You might want to change your shirt first."

I took it off and turned it around it was covered in slashes of blood.  "I'm sorry about that."

She handed me one of Jaces from the nearby closet.  "No problem.  It wasn't your fault."

They at least beleived me to a degree.  What I would tell them anyway.  Neither of them were happy I never told them exactly what was going on.  But I couldn't bring myself to say it much less say it outloud.

I pulled the shirt over my head and went into Mia's kitchen.  If one thing was for sure Mia had a great kitchen.  She had a grill right in the middle of her stove top and I would have loved to cook a steak on it, but that wasn't on the menu for today.  The kids wanted pancakes, eggs and bacon when I was over.  They were still in bed right now.

I made breakfast from scratch - well I didn't cure the bacon or fetch the eggs, but the pancakes I made from scratch.  It was one of my own special recipes.  It was healthier than regular pancakes but don't tell the kids that or they'd have your head.

I started a pot of coffee which was a brand new unopened package of a high end coffee that I knew Mia and Jace only bought cause I was here.  It was one of the few things I splurged on even in the wilderness.  They had already ground it which was disapointing but the smell was awesome.  I couldn't wait to have a cup of it.

I started with the batter and got it all mixed up.  Mia had all the ingredients but then she had wanted me to cook too so I knew she would.  Jace and Mia's kitchen was set up perfectly - at least while I was around.  I had a habit of putting things in their places even if they weren't there before.  That was one of my annoying compulsions.  I didn't like disorganized things so I tended to fix them.  I wasn't a neat freak.  It wasn't dirt or dust that bothered me.  Just things out of place.  But I wasn't complex enough to have patterns or such in things.  Just order.  I was thankful my compulsions didn't push the OCD patterns.  No counting things that drop or washing my hands 100 times.  

I started the bacon in the oven on a rack and then started flipping pancakes.  The first few were messy as it had taken me a few tries to get my groove.  I hadn't made pancakes since I was here last and that was over a year ago.

I started hearing sounds coming from the hallway as the kids started to wake up and get ready for school.  At one point JJ was screaming and running down the hall butt naked.  I pointed at the hallway he'd come from and he sulked and turned around the other way and back into his bedroom to finish changing.  

Naya was sitting at the kitchen table watching me flip pancakes.  She was a spitting image of her mother.  Which was a good thing she didn't need to take after Jace.  But she was unlike anyone in her family - quiet and shy and completely reserved.  Not an ounce of showoff in her, which made me wonder what had gotten into her with the little girl in the elevator.  "Hey Naya."

She looked over at me as I started making the scrambled eggs in the frying pan.  "Yeah Uncle Nox?"

"Why did that girl bother you so much?"  I flipped another pancaked and Naya grinned as it landed with a soft splat.  

"She's always picking on me.  Says I'm ugly.  Says I'm stupid."

I sighed.  The last pancake was done and the eggs were starting nicely.  I beckoned her to me with a single finger and she came over and wrapped her arms around my waist and pressed her head into my stomach.  I patted her back.  "Naya."  I lifted her little chin and saw a small stream of tears.  "Oh Naya, baby.  You aren't ugly.  You are a beautiful little girl, just like your Mama.  And you aren't stupid.  And anyone who's calling you names is only jealous.  Baby, you are the greatest little girl I know."

I turned back towards the eggs careful of Naya's arms around me and finished the eggs.  I called down the hall, "Breakfast is on."

I looked down at Naya.  "Set the table please."

She skipped away, and I hoped that what I had said helped and didn't make the whole boyfriend thing worse.

Mia came out searching under things and in corners.  "Naya you seen JJ's shoes?"

She shook her head.  "No ma'am.  He hide them again?"

I started looking around and found a pecicular weave hiding behind the potted plant.  "Mia they are in the corner."

I called out, "Hey JJ.  Come here man."

He ran towards me in his stocking feet and tried to slide but the carpet in the livingroom didn't allow him to do that.  "Did you hide your shoes?"

He looked down at the floor and nodded his head.  "Why?"

"So I didn't have to go to school."

I lifted his chin to look at me as I knelt down.  "Are you using magic on purpose?"

"What?  No.  I don't know any magic.  Except the light you taught me."  JJ produced a no heat dim little light orb above his hand.  

"You sure that's all you know?"

He nodded emphatically.  "Okay I'm going to show you a veil.  But you can't used it to hide things.  If I find out you are doing it on purpose I will have your daddy take away everything in your room and you'll only have a bed to sleep in and clothes in your drawers and closet.  Okay?"

He nodded.  "Yes sir.  No hiding things with this veil."

"Particularly your school things.  Do you understand?"

He nodded again.  "Pinky swear."  He held out his pinky and we shook on it.

I crafted a hidden pattern that JJ could see.  He was a fast learner so I did it slowly and wrapped it around Mia's end lamp table.  It vanished from sight.  JJ's mouth fell open in an O and said, "Cool!"

I undid the pattern and it came back unharmed.  I could explain the mechanics behind it but a four year old wasn't going to understand the idea of bending light.

JJ tried the weave and managed to hide half the lamp and he giggled.  

"Looks like you can only do small things.  The weave will eventually wear off but you cannot do it to anything on purpose do you understand me.  And if they find your shoes under another veil after this remember nothing in your room."

"Even my night light."

I nodded.  "Even your night light."

He nodded as Mia sat him down on the couch and helped him tie his shoes.  She smiled at me.  "Thanks.  Hopefully that will help."

I nodded.  "Hopefully."

While their family ate I slipped in Jace and Mia's bathroom and grabbed a shower.  Mia came in while I was pulling on the pair of dress pants that I was going to wear.  "You weren't hungry."

"I'll eat small before I go.  Don't need to have too much in my stomach."  

I turned to the mirror and started applying the eyeliner under my eyes and Mia giggled.  "I knew you used eye liner."  She rummaged through my toiletry bag, "That's all."

I grinned.  "My lipstick is in the other bag."

She laughed as Naya giggled behind her mom's leg.  "Uncle Nox do you really weare lipstick?"

"No ma'am.  Well I have.  But it's not a regular occassion.  And usually only when I really pushing the gay pride thing."

Mia smacked my arm.  "Nox.  She doesn't need to know that."

"Know what, that I like boys."

Naya giggled, "Mommy I know that already."

Mia shook her head.  "No, the gay pride thing - we don't diferentiate between sexual preferces."

I laughed.  "I wonder why."  I stuck my tongue out at Mia.

But it was Naya who commented.  "Because Daddy likes men too.  But he likes Mommy the most."

"He does at that."  I agreed.

Mia gave me that look that said I was wrong, but she didn't say anything with her daughter present.  It was really the only bad blood between us.  But it had only made us closer so not really bad blood.

I pulled on my dress shirt as Mia left and Naya stood in the doorway watching me.  "Uncle Nox, what are all those scars."

"Which ones?" I asked as I buttoned my shirt.  She came over and ran her fingers across my chest.  "Those are from a were bear that killed my mother.  He tried to kill me too."

"But he didn't.  I'm glad."

"Me too." I agreed.

I picked her up and sat her on the sink and started tying my tie.  She took it deftly in her hands and finished for me.  I watched her in the mirror and she did it perfectly.  I was impressed.  "Your dad let you do that for him?"

She laughed.  "Daddy can't tie a tie."

Jace must let her do it all the time because I know he can tie a tie, he has helped me on a number of occassions when my fingers were too shakey to be of use.

She wrapped her arms around me and rubbed my back.  The healing marks were still tender and I froze under her touch.  She smiled up at me.  "I'm sorry someone hurt you."

I grinned at her.  "It's alright hunny.  I'll survive.  I promise."  And I would.  It was everything I could do to survive my nightmares and fears and I would not let them beat me down.

But right now my biggest fear was two hours away and I hadn't even looked over my notes since the plane.
