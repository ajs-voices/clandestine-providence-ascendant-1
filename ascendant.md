# Part I: The Dawning

## Fear of Flying

My flight out of Denver International Airport was early but not too early at least not for me.  By the time most people's alarm clocks were going off I was already up, had a quick work out and was showered.  I had a light breakfast - completely not my usual thing consisting of cereal and milk - a sugared cereal at that.  It was all the free Continental breakfast had at this early hour that I would eat.  There was plenty of food just nothing I was overly fond of.  Things like pastries and donuts or other sugary type foods.  

But this morning was already stressful might as well add a bad breakfast to it as well.  I was thankful that my trip through security wasn't too bad well unless of course you count rude men and crying babies.  Security had a long line.  In front of me was a man wearing a fedora and a long trench-coat.  He looked like the kinda guy who you'd worry about having a bomb underneath that jacket.  But he shed it like the rest of us, hat and all and waited for his turn to place his things on the conveyor belt.

In front of him was a small redhead toting around a toddler.  The toddler wasn't happy with situation and started screaming when the woman tried to take off his shoes.  Instead of offering to help or politely waiting the man in front of me went around her - butt in front of her with a side remark.  "You shouldn't travel alone miss."

The look the small redhead gave him mimicked my thoughts exactly _How rude!_ but I didn't say anything either.  I stood behind her and watched as she struggled with the little man and he refused to be put down and she couldn't hold him.  I asked, "Do you need some help?"

The woman looked up and frowned then shook her head.  "I got this."  She looked back down to fiddle with her son's shoe.  I'm sure she was reacting to my outer apperance, the t-shirt under a hoodie with holey jeans that were all the rage.  I'm sure the eye liner and red tips in my hair that hung over my right eye didn't help matters either.  I probably looked like some wanna-be goth emo kid to her.  But I couldn't help but chuckle at the irony because she clearly did not have this.  

I asked. "Are you sure?"

She nodded.  "Yeah."  But she didn't sound very convincing.

I gently moved her hands from the tiny shoe and carefully untied the knotted laces that were giving a one handed momma a hard time.  The shoe slipped off quickly and she looked relieved.  "Thanks, I guess," she said to me as she placed all of her things on the belt and stepped through the medal detectors without being further assaulted.  

I didn't have the same luck.  I was randomly chosen to be searched a little more throughly, I hadn't even stepped through the metal detector when the man pulled me aside and started waving the wand over my long arms.  He was a short stocky man build like a truck.  But when the wand neared my junk I had to comment despite the beat down I was likely to get.  "Don't ya think you should be me a drink first?"

The man gave me this look that was a cross between pissed off and completely taken back.  I grinned at him.  "Sorry, man, had to lighten the mood."

The security officer rolled his eyes and went back to work.  As a parting gift he used the small want to swat my backside.  I turned around with a laugh, "Next you buy me drinks first!"

He let out a loud guffaw and went back to work.  At least some people can take a joke I wasn't always so lucky.  I'd been beat down on a regular basis because of my sexual preferences.  I'm not saying I don't like women because I do - a lot.  I just also happen to like men.  And bigotry and homophobic tendencies run high in the land of the free.  Everyone seems entitled to their right way - sure the land of the free is free but only if you are exactly like us.  Dicks!  

I knew my train of thought was only going to make shit worse when I actually got on the plane so I found a stall that sold water and I bought two bottles and a cheap magazine to read while I waited in the terminal to distract my mind.  But I can't stop being me even when I know it causes people to stair at me.  The magazine was a teeny-bopper glam magazine meant for teenage girls.  I was far from teenage and short of the eyeliner I applied everyday I wasn't really into make up.

The terminal was empty except for a one other passenger, and elderly lady with an oxygen tank sitting next to her seat.  I sat two seats away from her.  I was a social butterfly.  Jace asked me more than once, "Do you ever not talk to people?"

I could only shrug at my best friends question.  I was looking for something in someone.  I don't know what.  But I wanted people to make up their mind about me out of the gate so I could move on.  People were dicks in most cases.  They refused to talk to you or they ignored you.  Even when I didn't hit on them, they were still dicks.

I dropped the magazine in the chair between us and the woman looked down and then back up at me and I grinned at her.  "You can read it.  I'm sure a lovely young lady like yourself doesn't need any tips, but hey it can't hurt either, can it?"

The woman smiled at me and for a woman her age I was certain those were her real choppers.  I grinned at her, "Great smile."

The elderly woman turned a pretty shade of rose and waved her hand in front of her.  Bingo!  Job well done.  I added, "I'm sure all the gentleman at home notice too."

The blush deepened just as a woman sat across from us.   From the way she'd plopped down in the seat she had a rough time of something.  I beamed my best smile at her and continued with the charade, "This must be your sister."  It was likely she was her daughter or grand-daughter judging by her age, but if I were take a guess she was a spitting image of the older woman.

The elderly woman's blush was all but gone at the compliment, "Oh dear no.  This is my grand-daughter, Erin."  

"A pleasure.  Nox."  I turned back towards the elderly woman and offered her my hand, "And what may I call you other than sweet-thing?"

I gained another slight blush as the woman too my hand in hers.  "It's Erin too." 

"A pleasure, Erin."  I raised her hand to my lips and could smell the tale-tell signs of a hospital on her - she was clearly from a nursing home or a stint in the actual hospital.  I kissed the top of her middle knuckle and she pulled her hand from my light grip.

"You indulge an old lady.  You shouldn't waste your flattery on me.  My grand-daughter would be far better suited for it."  She chided.

I laughed, "Duckling, she probably hears all that all the time.  You on the other hand are a doll and I'm sure no one tells you enough."  I patted the magazine on the chair between us - tapping at the biggest article on the cover "How to be better in bed".  She glanced down at my tapping and blushed.  "I wasn't lying when I told you you probably didn't need any advice on the topic.  I'm sure you are a wild cat."

She lowered her head and I could see the rose color rising to her ears.  The younger version of her self picked up the magazine and tossed it at me.  "Leave my grandmother alone you pervert!"

Score number 2 I managed to piss off the young one.  "Pervert?  That's all you got?"

The younger Erin rolled her eyes at me and helped her grandmother stand.  "Nana, let's move over here so you can rest in peace."

I called out after them, "Ms. Erin, don't let them put you in the grave before you are ready.  We are only as old as we think we are."  I added as a second thought, "And nice ass."

I could hear the younger woman grumbling as she walked away from me with her grandmother in tow.  I listened to their conversation for a short while before I notice a small hand wiggling it's way towards the magazine.  A boy of about 3 years old was sneaking the magazine from my lap.  I looked around for his mother and found her busy trying to situated the stroller, a car seat and several small bags into a means to carrying them all and her son. 

I handed the boy the magazine and picked him up in my lap.  He turned and sat down with the magazine in his lap and flipped to the first page.  I started reading, figured that's what he wanted.  It was the Table of Contents but hey, the kid didn't care.  The moment I read the "How to be better in bed" title the redhead looked up, snatched her son from my lap and glared at me.  Her little voice squeaked before she was actually able to make any words come out of her mouth, "How dare you?  First you assault that old woman and now you assault my son - again!"

I shrugged.  "If that's how you want to see it fine by me.  But you should pay more attention to your son, he was over hear trying to take it from me."

She turned a color almost as read as her hair.  "I'm so sorry.  That was uncalled for."

"No harm no foul."  I stood up so I wasn't looking up at her, not something I enjoyed, being 6'0" I was usually the one being looked up to.  "Name is Nox.  Let me help you.  Reorganize your gear, or hold your son while you do it.  I'm getting on this plane and I'm not going anywhere until it leaves.  I give you my word."  I held up two fingers in scout's honor.  

She laughed, which was better than yelling at me.   I handed her my ticket.  "You hold this to prove I'm not going anywhere."

She looked down at it and then at her ticket in her pocket and sighed. "It seems I won't be getting away from you any this morning."  She held up her ticket and the seat was right next to mine.  

I smiled.  "I'll behave.  Promise."

I took the little boy from her hands and sat back down on my seat with the magazine in our laps and we pointed out pictures.  He was pretty good at finding even tiny little letters in the print.  A smart kid.

She started fixing her things again and then looked up at me and her son with what I could only explain as fear I had left with her son.  I smiled at her to reassure her but I doubted that would work.  She spoke to me a few moments after going back to her work.  "Stella, and that's Aidan."

I nodded.  "A pleasure.  I'd offer you my hand but it seems both of them are rather occupied."  Aidan had taken to moving my hands to open and close the magazine and he was giggling softly to himself.

Stella giggled herself and sat down across from us and watched her son play.  I spent the greater part of my wait tending to the squirming child in my lap.  I missed Jace's kids.  I was glad that he was picking me up when I landed.  It would be good to see JJ and Naya.

A woman, who was clearly a stewardess, came over to us and looked at me.  "Would you like to board first?"

I looked up and was surprised to see Cindy - a regular flight attendant on other trips out of town just not usually to New York.  She frowned and then smiled.  "I didn't know you had a son."

I laughed.  "I don't.  This is her son.  I don't want to sit on that death trap any longer than I already have to." I looked across the floor to Stella, "Do you want to get on first?  I'm pretty sure she meant to ask you."

Stella looked up at her.  "No, we'll board when he does, he's rather helpful."

I laughed. The stewardess smiled sweetly at me.  "Alright, sweetie.  I'll see you on board."  She winked at me. 

Stella was staring at me.  "Friend of yours?" she asked.

I shrugged.  "A girl I slept with."

"So you really are that playboy? You weren't just being nice to an older woman."  She sounded like that was a bad thing.

"At least you know what you get."  I said with my inflated ego voice.

Stella rolled her eyes at me as the intercom called the first rows.  "Why didn't you want to get on early?  It'd have been easier."

"Afraid of flying.  I'm putting it off as long as I can. So my anxiety doesn't spike prematurely."

Stella laughed, "Does that happen often?"

Oh I liked her.  I grinned at her.  "No.  I make sure they are satisfied before hand."

The rose color of her embarrassment rushed to her face and she took Aidan from my hands and sniffed his bottom then wrinkled her nose.  I laughed.  "That's sexy."

And I was rewarded with a deepening red as she sat her son in her lap trying to look all casual like.  But she didn't try to speak.

I winked at her.  "Come on, let's get on the plane so you can change him."

Standing up I grabbed her things and mine but Stella hesitated.  "But.."

"I'll be fine."  I offered her a hand up with a grin.  She took it carefully adjusting her son to her hip.  Her hand was warm and I could smell the sweet scent of roses as she drew near.  Aidan didn't smell like he needed to be changed to me, but then again I wasn't focusing on that.  It must be a mother thing.  

Stella had our three tickets in her hands and I had everything else except Aidan and we stood impatiently in line to get on the stupid, flying, death trap they called an airplane.  I really hated airplanes.  ## Distractions

I was afraid of flying, it wasn't the airplanes fault, or the pilots.  It was my mother's fault.

I had just turned five when I was on my first flight.  It probably wouldn't have been so bad if it were not for the fact that only hours before my mother was spiting at me and calling me a monster.  And hours before that I had sparked.  I watched as a time flicker of flame caught fire on the curtains.  I remember it clear as day.

I remember that tiny little pattern coalesce and form and take light with only my thoughts to guide it.  I know it was me.  I knew then it was me.  My mother knew it was me too.  

I took a deep breath and swallowed the memory into the depths of my mind again.  I disliked thinking about her - about my mother - the woman who gave me away without a second thought.  I hated her.  I could hear Margo's words screaming back at me now.  _"You don't hate her.  You are angry.  You have every right to be but hate is a very strong word."_  It was something she said to me often when the topic of my mother came up.

There was a warm hand with rose scent wafting up from my arm that brought me back to my senses.  Stella asked, "You okay?  We are almost there."

I nodded my head.  I didn't trust my words as I shifted our things to the other side so I could get my ID out of my wallet in my back pocket.  It was a Colorado issued drivers license however I had never taken a driving test so to speak at least not in Colorado.  I had in New York City where I grew up but that was a long time ago.

The picture was a poor representation of myself but it at least looked like me.  Jace's never had, but then again he had a black eye the day he took the picture.

It wasn't the stewardess at the counter that I knew who took our tickets.  She didn't think twice about the fact that we weren't actually together.  Two separate parties but our seats were together and we looked like a happy little family, but we were complete strangers.

We walked down the narrow cat walk that connected the terminal to the airplane and I could feel my heart starting to race.  I could feel the sweat starting to form at the base of my neck.  Stella was in front of me and for that I was grateful.  She turned around to make sure I was still following and she frowned.  "You really don't like to fly do you?"

I shook my head.  "No, but I'll be fine."

Several other passengers behind us rushed passed us as we stood in the catwalk.  I drapped my arm around the tiny redhead and rubbed the little boy's shoulder and hurried us along the rest of the way.  There was no better way to do this than to just get it done.  Stella commented, "Like a band-aid."

I laughed softly, "Did I say that out loud?"

She patted my hand, "Yep."

I apologized, "Sorry.  I'll try not to let that happen again."

Stella squeezed my hand and we entered the plane single file with her things trailing behind me as I lugged everything through the narrow passage ways.  My friend greeted me at the door way and winked at me slyly.  I rolled my eyes once I was past her.  I wasn't exactly in the playing mood right now - she knew this.

Stella found our seats and stopped to set Aidan in the seat and asked, "Can I have his seat?"  

I managed to get it undone from the set up Stella had manuevered and  handed it her without knocking anyone in the head.  There were people waiting behind us to get past and I turned and apologized to them  but the were rude anyway.  I didn't hurry on principle then.

Stella got Aidan in the seat by the window strapped into his car seat and the airplane seat and she was trying to get inside the row so I could put things away.  The man behind me tried to push me and I turned and grinned at him.  "Sorry.  Women and children first."

He gave me a nasty glare.  I laughed and picked up the stroller and started to put it away in the overhead bin with the rest of our things.  I grabbed the magazine I'd bought and my earbuds from my things and sat down slowly next to Stella as she fussed with her son.  He was not happy to be strapped in from the sounds of things.

Stella busied her self with changing Aidan while we awaited on the plane. I could hear my pulse in my ears.  I knew that my palms were sweaty as I gripped the arm of the chair.  Stella patted my hand, "It'll be alright."

"It always is."  I said flatly.  "Give Aidan the magazine.  It should keep him quiet."

"He'll just eat it."  Stella said.

"No.  Trust me."

"I know my son."  I could hear the anger in her voice.

I shrugged.  "Fine."  I pulled my hand from under hears and put it in my lap and squeezed my knees instead.  I could feel the strength of my own grip and was thankful I didn't have the strength of the Venatori or I'd have bruises.

The flight attendants started their spiel and I couldn't pay attention to the words.  I closed my eyes and focused on my breathing.  This was worse than the elevators in the AU building back home.  It was a long drawn out process one I had to endure for hours.  I don't think I could actually make a flight over seas.

Stella fussed with her son over sitting still and squawking.  The plane started moving and my heart skipped a beat as I clutch my leg.  Landings and takeoffs were the worst parts.  Once the take off was complete I could zone into my headset and meditate and keep most of the anxiety at bay, but right now without the music as a distraction I was going to have issues.

A hand snuck across the chair arm and snagged the magazine.  I heard Stella, "Here.  Just stop, Aidan."  

I was too preoccuppied to notice what happened next.  The plane lifted off the ground and my stomach reeled.  I could feel it flipping inside.  I took a deep breath and held it until it hurt too much.  

Stella grabbed my hand and squeezed it and put it on the arm chair clasped under hers.  I looked over at her and notice Aidan was happily flipping through the magazine she'd taken from me.  I gave her a half smile and turned back towards the front and focused on my breathing, and not crushing Stella's delicate hand in mine. It was soft and warm.  I could smell the sweet scent of roses.  I turned my focus to the soft scent and the warmth of her hand, it helped to focus on something real - something in my control.  It was the basis of one of my anxiety rituals - five things I could see, four things I could touch, three things I could hear, two things I could smell and one thing I could taste.  

The idea of tasting pulled at more primal things inside me with a beautiful woman sitting next to me holding my hand.  I pushed away those thoughts Stella was far from my type.  Well not my type, but those I allowed myself to become involved with.  She was a mother, and likely had a significant other.  And if there wasn't, I'm not the type of guy who wants to get involved with someone who wants more than just sex.  I didn't do relationships.  I could see Margo rolling her eyes at me as I say the same thing to her.  I can feel the smack across the head from my now present father.  Don't treat women like that.  

Yet my father had more children with more woman than most Venatori.  He was a sought after sould apparently.  I was still trying to get over my past with my father.  I hated him for so many years for not being there for me.  And when I found out at my graduation from the Academy that he'd been around me my whole life.  I was pissed.  I'm still pissed.  Though Margo would remind me that I'm not angry at him.  He was a victim too.  He hadn't known about me until I knew about him.  I shouldn't blame him.

A call over the intercom brought me back to the present.  Stella squeezed my hand and I turned my attention back to her.  "You okay?" she asked.

I nodded.  "Yeah."  I squeezed her hand and pulled from of her warm grip.  "Thanks."

She smiled at me.  It was such a prett smile underneath those great green orbs.  "You should go get a drink of water."

I shook my head and pulled a bottle of water from the pocket in my cargo pants.  Stella laughed as I cracked the top and slugged back the water.

Aidan started squawking again.  I nodded, "His ears hurt."

Stella sighed and took out a sippy cup and handed it to him.  "How do you know what he wants?"

I shrugged, "Sixth sense I guess."  It was in reality.  It wasn't a gift like empathy, it was more reading body language, and understanding what the patterns around a person meant.  It was the first time that I'd actually let my mind see what it had been seeing around Aidan the whole time.  His aura, not really the psychic kind, I didn't see those, but the way the patterns moved around him I could see things I shouldn't see.  He couldn't be Venatori.  She wasn't, she was human, I could see that.  "Why are you going to New York City or is it just a stop through?"  I had a very bad feeling about this.

Stella smiled.  "Job interview."  She frowned and then looked out the window.  I didn't even want to think of what she saw but she smiled and turned back to me.  "I lost my job a month ago.  I can't seem to land another one, but my mom talked to Aidan's father who I didn't know she was talking to until recently and he's arranged for an interview in New York City at his company."

"A dead beat father?  I know that feeling."  I said without thinking.

Stella sighed, "It's not like that.  I didn't tell him.  The day I was going to tell him, he told me he didn't love me, couldn't love me and he had to go.  I forgot about what I wanted to tell him and I asked him why and he confided that he liked men."

"So you didn't tell him you were pregnant?"  I paled.  If Aidan was Minorem - half human half Venatori like he looked to be she could have died. Fuck!  She has no idea what danger she was in.  "When did he find out?"

"My mother contacted him when she found his phone number in my phone still after Aidan had been born and she was helping me out.  She called him and told him.  She said he was ready to get on a plane and wisk me away to New York but she talked him out of it.  But here I am using his so-called connections to try and get a job."  She looked out the window again. "Apparently he works at some school and is a big wig, and they are always looking for people with my skills to help with the office work."

"What company?" I asked to confirm.

"It's some subsidary of Apex Unlimited.  They are putting me up in Hotel Pennsylvania and I have an interview at their building."  She turned to me and sat up straight in her chair and asked, "You know anything about Apex Unlimited?"

"I work for them, in a round about sort of way.  A subsidary of a subsidary or something."

She asked, "Are they good to work for?"

I nodded.  "I've never wanted for anything since being with them."  Which was true.  The Venatori took care of their own.  They didn't pay well in human standards, but you were garunteed a place to live, three squares a day and all your needs tended too.  They paid you a measley stippened for your wants.  And I had been with them a long time.  I added, "The daycare system is excellent.  Provided housing is adequate.  Their cafeteria is acceptable but I prefer to cook myself."

"What do you do for them?"  Stella asked.

I didn't know if she knew anything about my world so I had to go with the half truth.  "I'm a secuirty consultant.  I travel around the country taking care of problems for them.  I'm flying back for a conference they are having this week because I have a unique view of some of the problems."

"Oh that sounds wonderful." 

I shrugged, "I suppose.  I'm a little afraid of talking in front of this crowd.  I'm not a shy person, but these people are the big wigs of everything and I'm just a little lowly field worker.  What do I know?"

Stella took my hand in hers and squeezed it.  "Apparently more than them if they asked you to speak."

I shrugged again.  Aidan crawled out of his seat and into his mama's lap and then  into mine with the magazine.  I grinned at her.  "Apparently we are talking too much."

Stella laughed softly.  "I'm sorry.  He seems to like you."

"Kids normally do."  I grinned at her.  "Something about the age difference."

She chuckled as I put my attention to the little lap stealer and his magazine.  For the next twenty minutes while drinks and snacks were passed around Aidan and I pointed and near naked women in ads and discussed the finer points of body parts.  It was entertaining to see a three year old exclaim boobies on the plane.  Stella covered her mouth in embarassement and I could only laugh.  He was going to be a breast man.

I siped at the water I'd brought with me and refused the refreshments they had provided.  Stella instead prompted me to get her a coke and she downed both of them.  I imagined that she was up late nights with her son.  Or worrying over what she was going to do with her life.

I asked.  "Do you intend to let his father into his life?"

Stella shrugged.  "I hadn't thought about it.  I suppose I should. I mean he has tried to take care of us, but I won't let him."

I nodded.  The man was at least honorable at that rate.  And it made me realize that maybe I needed to try harder with my own father.

Stella interrupted my train of thought.  "You go blank often, what's on your mind?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing.  Just reminded how similar this is to my own childhood."

"Oh?"

"My mother left me in the care of strangers when I was five.  My father didn't know I existed until I was 18.  I hated him for not being there as a child.  But it was my mother's choice to keep him out of my life even though she wasn't in it.  I was just thinking I should try harder with my own father.  It wasn't his fault."

Stella laughed.  "You are making this up to make me feel guilty."

I shook my head and stared down the aisle in front of me.  "No.  My mother spit at me and called me a monster and left me with people who could help me."

"That's horrible."  Stella sounded revolted by the thought.

I shrugged.  "Whatever."

"Have you talked to your mother since then?"  she asked.

"Twice.  Once when I was 18 when my father was introduced to me and the second time a few months later when she died."  My mother had been hunting a werebear and I was assigned the task to find it on my own and kill it.  It was part of my first hunt with my handler. My mother didn't want to give up the job so she came with us and insisted we do it her way.  So she was the first one in the werebear's cave and the first one attacked.  

She suffered massive injuries to her chest and I received a rake to the chest before I was able to kill it.  We rushed my mother to the Boulder Infirmary but she'd been bitten.  And the disease that makes a human a were creature tore my mother apart.  I watched her suffer through the window in the door because she refused my presence in her room.  I watched her die hating me.  

Stella tapped my arm.  "You did it again.  You okay?"

I nodded.  "Yeah, bad memories."

Stella squezed my arm, "I'm sorry for your loss."

I shrugged.  "I'm not."

"You can't hate your mother."

I nodded.  "I do.  She hated me.  Even in the end she hated me.  I watched her die from the other side of the door because she wouldn't let me in to her room."  I shook myself just as the seat belt light went on and we started our decent.  Just what I needed as we landed - more fucking anxiety.

## Best Friend

The landing made me sweat and my heart race as it always had, but Stella's warm hand on mine helped keep the worst of the panic attack away.  Thoughts of my mother were never good.  We waited until the plane was nearly empty before we got stood up and started gathering our things.  Aidan had passed out.  "I'll help you get to your car."

Stella smiled and nodded her thanks.  "Alright.  I appreciate it."

"No problem."  I said as we walked down the narrow passage of the airplane to the exit.  The catwalk made me just as nervous.  The long arm of steel and flooring suspended off the ground wasn't much better than an elevator if you asked me.  I took a deep breathe once we reached the terminal and I stopped at the first row of chairs and sat down for a moment to catch my breath and slow my heart rate.

Stella stood swaying next to me as she rocked Aidan's still sleeping form.  She asked, "You okay?"

I nodded and stood up.  "Yeah.  Better now.  Thanks."  I smiled at her and grabbed the stroller and unfolded it so Stella could drop the little one into it.  

He squawked a moment before he was passed out again with his little stuffed animal.  I couldn't quite make it out as Stella placed it in his arms.  It was yet another reminder of my first flight - holding on to my little stuffed Mushu and crying into his red plush fur trying not to upset my mother more.

I shook my hands and my body and we moved forward.  Stella didn't ask and I was grateful for not having to fully dredge up that memory.

We walked slowly through the cooridor of terminals in JFK's airport.  I had landed her often, but I remembered walking down the same path my first time.  Garrett houlding my hand and talking to me about what we were about to embark upon.  

I fought back the bile that started to rise in my stomach at the thought of my tormentor.  I hated him more than I hated my mother.  And for good reason.  But I shook the memories off as we reached the baggage claim area.  I expected to see Jace standing there with some stupid sign like he always did but he wasn't anywhere to be seen.  I pulled my phone out of my pocket and checked the time.  We were late - which means Jace got busy or forgot.  I would lay my bet on forgot.  It wouldn't be the first time.

Items had already started rolling around the carosel and Stella was pulling at her bags as they passed.  I stepped up beside her and helped her get the heavy bag off the belt and on to the floor next to Stella.  "What do you have in there?" I asked.  It wasn't overly heavy for me, but it was bulky and not really what I'd have brought with a child in tow, but it was the only bag other than her carryons so it was full utility it seemed.

Stella shook her head, "You've never traveled with a kid before."

I grinned.  "Can't say that I have."  My things made their way around.  One backpack filled with camping gear, the pots and pan I used out in the field were tie wrapped to their holsters for safe keeping, and my duffle full of my entire wardrobe and my life at current.  If it didn't fit in either, or my carryon backpack I didn't need it.  Was as simple as that.  My gun and survival knife were stored in a lock box in the camping bag and I had permits that said I could carry then on the plane in proper storage.  I hadn't gotten any complaints when I declared them.  I was a liscensed private invesigator among other things in order to get when I needed done - as were all hunters.  The human world was always getting in the way of things.

Stella giggled.  "Regular old grizzly adams."  She reached up and the beard on my chin.  "Though your beard could use some work."

I rolled my eyes.  "I like it like this."

Stella blushed, "So do I."  She started walking towards the car rental stands and I followed behind her pushing Aidan while she carried the suit case.  He had grabbed it on purpose.  

I stood back and waited for Stella to finish up with her rental and I looked around for any sign that my best friend would show up.  I didn't see him.  I pulled out my phone and dialed his number.  The phone rang for half a ring before I heard, "Fuck! I'm sorry."

I laughed.  "You forgot - again?"

"Yeah man.  Sorry.  I'll be there in an hour can you hold tight."  Jace sounded rushed and I knew he'd not be here in an hour.

"Nah.  I'll just take a cab."  

Stella stood next to me. "No you won't.  I'll drop you off anywhere you want.  It's the least I can do."

I smiled at her then I heard Jace, "Did you pick up a girl?"

I laughed.  "Not so much as picked up as she helped me through the flight."

I heard Jace groan on the other side.  "Dude, you better pay her back real well."

I smiled.  "I think we are even man.  I'll call you later, let you know the plan."

"Alright dude, but Mia expects you at the house tonight."

I nodded.  "I know.  I'm looking forward to it.  Can't wait to see Naya and JJ.  And Mia.  You I'm mad at."

Jace barked a laugh.  "Fair enough.  I'm sorry man. Really.  We'll be leaving her around 5pm so call before then."

"Alright, Jace.  Love ya babe."

"Love ya too.  See ya soon."  Jace hung up the phone and Stella was looking away.

"Babe? Your boyfriend?" She asked.  She looked a little down

I shook my head.  "My best friend.  Just a term of endearmant we toss around.  Use to be to make people uncomfortable, now it's just habit."

"And you love him?" Stella seemed a little taken back by my exchange of words.

"He's like a brother to me.  Yeah. I love him."  

"Oh."  Stella stammered without really wanting to say what she wanted, I could hear it in her voice.

"Now you are questioning things?  About me?  And Jace?"  I leaned down and whispered in Stella's ear.  "I like men, yes. But I also like women."

"Oh."  Her voice rose up in a cresendo and I knew I had taken her off guard by telling her what she had been wondering.

I grabbed the baggage handle before Stella could and hoisted my dubble on my shoulder and said, "Lead the way."

Stella sighed. "Alright."  I followed the short little red head to the SUV they had rented for her.  It was a safe enough model.

She packed her things in first then I set mine in behind her minus the bag I'd brought on the plane with me.  Stella handed me Aidan as she finished putting the stroller in then moved to the passenger side rear seat and started strapping in the car seat.  I watched as she worked.  She'd done this many times from the look of it.  It made me wonder what kinda guy doesn't step up to a girl like this.  I urked me a bit.

Aidan was groggy in my arms and laying his head against the crock of my neck and humming to himself as I rubbed his back when Stella turned around with a smile.  "I've never seen him take to anyone like you."

I grinned.  "I told you it's the relative age distance."

She strapped Aidan in and I climb into the passenger side.  I had no problems letting a woman drive.  As long as I wasn't driving in New York City I was happy.## Hotel Penn

We chatted on the short route to the LIE and on our way into the city.  I asked, "Where did they put you up?"

Stella nodded towards the GPS display on the dash.  "Hotel Pennsylvania."

I whistled.  "Posh.  Your ex must have some pull."

Stella shrugged.  "I dunno.  Why is it fancy?"

I nodded.  "Yeah, fancy is a word for it."

"How far is it from the building?"  Stella asked.

"About a 15 minute walk.  You can catch a train and make it in half that.  But really no point in it."

"So I really don't have to drive too far to drop you off." Stella seemed surprised.

"You can take me to the hotel.  I'll walk from there."  I would enjoy the walk.  I hadn't walked in my home town in many years.

"No.  I can drop you off, it'll let me see the building."

"I'd rather walk."  I insisted.  "Walking is good, it'll give me time to think."

"You need time to think?"  Stella asked.

"Always.  It's Sunday and I have a big presentation tomorrow.  I will miss my weekly check-in with my therapist and that's going to throw a whole new kink into the works." 

"Your therapist?"  Stella giggled.  "Your dad trying to straight you out?"

I shook my head.  "No, ma'am.  I've been in therapy since I was six.  The drama with my mother was only worsed by a year of ... well not so good treatment.  There was an accident and to insure it was really an accident they had me in pschye eval for a while.  I've continued the sessions because the PTSD and the OCPD never really went away.  I cope and manage everyday."

"Sounds rough.  Any other acryonyms you want to toss out there?"

I laughed.  "None that need to be said."

She grinned at me.  "So you have someone back home?"

I turned to look at the little red head driving.  "Are you asking me if I have a girlfriend?"

Stella blushed answering my question without answering.

"No.  Nor do I have a boyfriend.  I don't do relationships.  But for the record, this is home.  There is work."

Stella frowned.  "What are you a monk?  'I don't do relationships.'"  She laughed but it wasn't an I find you humorous laugh it was nervous and worried.

I leaned back in my chair.  "No, not a monk or celabate.  I've had plenty of sexual partners since I was 13 years old.  Just no relationships."

"That sounds lonely."  Stella sounded sad.

"Maybe.  But no one can hurt you if you don't let them in."  I said as I stared off into the distance watching the city draw near.

"That sounds really lonely."

I shrugged and we rode the rest of the way in silence.

Stella pulled up into the parking garage nearest the hotel and parked her rental car and got out and started to pull out our things from the back.  I got out slowly.  I had not intended to sleep with her, but now that I was fairly certain that particular card was off the table I was wanting to persuade her to let me into her bed.

I heard a squawk from the back seat and opened the rear door I had just passed and unbelted Aidan and shifted him to my hip and he clung to me like he was used to doing it.  His head was leaned against my shoulder and his little hand played little circles on my shoulder blade.  

Stella looked up and smiled shaking her head.  I asked, "What?"

Stella handed me my duffle bag and gear bag and took her son fro me.  "Nothing.  You look good with kids."

I grinned at her.  "Thanks."  But the reminder that she had a son had tempered my prior emotions.  I was okay with that which was odd.  "I'll help you inside if that's alright?"

Stella nodded.  "I'd like that.  I think Aidan would too."

We walked to the hotel which was across the street and down the block.  Stella hadn't wanted to use valet, something about not feeling right.  We got to the door of the hotel and the door man kindly opened it up and I followed Stella inside to the desk.  A bell hop brought a cart over and I set Stella's things on it and he stood there waiting for room number and information.  

The woman at the desk was a pretty blonde and I smiled at her as I stood behind Stella waiting for her to get through.  She turned and handed me a squirming Aidan, "Can you hold him while I do this.  He's being a worm."

"Sure." It wasn't like I had a choice in the matter she'd pretty much thrust him in my arms to begin with.  I tickled the little man in my arms and he giggled and squrimed until his mother returned pulling him gently from my arms.  

Stella looked at the bellhop and handed him a ten and said, "503."  He nodded and started for the elevator.  Stella looked at me with a grin.  "Do you want to come up?"

I looked at my phone for the time and decided that I did have time.  But I said, "I really shouldn't."  What the fuck was I doing, turning down this girl.

She smiled at me.  "Please?  You can tell me more about Apex Unlimited and we can order in while Aidan takes a nap.  I could use the company."

I looked at my phone again hoping that I could find some way out of it but there was nothing.  "Alright, I have time before Jace leaves.  I'll have him pick me up here."

We approached the elevator and I had to swallow hard as I stepped into the small cramped space with the bellhop cart, and two other adults inside.  I closed my eyes and clutched the metal rail.  Stella placed her warm hand on top of mine, "Don't like elevators either?"

I shrugged.  "I don't like heights at all."

I could feel the small woman step closer to me and pressed her leg against mine and Aidan climbed into my arms.  I had no other choice but to wrap my arm around him and around Stella's shoulder.  She settled against me with ease and I could feel the all to familiar tightness increase.  I thought to myself _I don't do relationships that's what she wants._

By the time the elevator stopped my heart was racing for more than one reason.  I was the last one off the elevator I followed Stella and the bellhop to her room and I was ready to leave.  I had to leave before she got the wrong impression.

Stella opened the door and the bellhop took our things into her room.  I took a deep breath and stepped inside.  The room was lavious and smelled clean.  I found no hints of any other odors not even the scent of cleaning fluid.  It was perfect.

I looked around while Stella unpacked.  I set Aidan down and he squawked and bounced with his hands in the air.  "Up," he demanded.

I lifted the little boy back up and moved to sit down on the couch.  He slayed himself on top of me and was soon snoring softly against my shoulder.

Stella smiled as she came and gently lifted him from me and took him to the play pen she'd set up.  I noticed a small patch of drool on my shirt.  It wasn't the first time, and it wasn't likely the last but without Aidan to create a buffer I was feeling axious.  And I don't get anxious around girls - even pretty ones.

Stella sat down next to me and I pulled my phone out I had to call Jace or I'd forget.  He picked up the phone quickly.  "Already?  Damn you are fast."

I laughed.  "Can you pick me up at Hotel Penn on your way home?"

I pulled the phone away from my ear and glanced at the time.  I still had time.  My hearts started to race faster.  Fuck.  

Jace answered.  I'd missed part of it, but I got the part I needed.  "I'll be there at 5pm sharp.  Don't be late."

"I'll be the one outside with my leg showing."

Stella giggled.  

Jace laughed.  "Don't do anything I wouldn't do."

"Bye Jace."

We hung up and Stella reached down and pulled my pant leg up.  She sighed.  "I thought you might have shaved."

I rolled my eyes.  She ran her fingers under my eyes, "I mean you do wear make up and all."

Again I rolled my eyes.  She had manuevered herself to her knees and was too close.  And the look in her eyes said more than words every could.  And I had enjoyed her touching me.  All day she had been touching me and I had enjoyed her soft rose scent and her warm touch.  I missed the touch of others.  I had been out in the field too long alone.

A small sigh escaped as her fingers played with a fringe of dyed-red hair over my left eye.  She was flirting and she knew the reaction she was getting from me.  I said in a low husky voice filled with the lust I was feeling, "I don't do relationships."

She whispered, "I know," in my ear.  I could feal her silky breath on my skin.

"You aren't typically my type."

She pulled back and slapped me upside the head, "And what type is that?"

I sighed.  Fucked that up again.  "A single mother.  A mom with a toddler to look out for."

I stood up and took a step back from the couch.  "Stella, I have rules.  I don't sleep with married individuals.  I don't sleep with anyone who may want more out of me than just sex.  I don't do relationships."

Stella stood up and stepped closer to me and looked up.  "You sure know how to kill the mood.  What if I just wanted sex?"

I smiled down at her and took another step back.  "I'd have to ask you why?"

Her face turned red.  "I need a reason to want sex?"  She was angry now.

"Well.  No."  She advanced on me and I took a step back for every step she took towards me until her hands balled up in a fist and my back hit the wall.  Fuck.  A gear in my head slipped and I could feel the panic and the fear rising up.  I tried to explain myself but nothing coherent came out of my mouth.  "I...Um.."

Stella stood inches from me with her fists balled up and staring up at me with fury.  "Spit it out."

As commanded I spoke cleanly and clearly in the voice I hadn't heard in a long time.  "You don't need a reason, but I wouldn't think a parent like you would want a casual relationship around your son.  One based on sex and sex alone.  As a single parent I'd hope your priority was your son."

The anger rose in her and then as she looked at me pressed against the wall in fear she frowned and stepped back.  I felt a little lighter but the panic still coursed through my veins.  The fear was riding my mind and I was truly afraid of the little red head in front of me.  She cocked her head at me and sighed as she sat back down. "You really are messed up aren't you?"

I stayed pressed agains the wall only relaxing enough to shake my hands out.  "You have no idea."

Stella sat on the couch and wrung her hands in front of her.  "I'm sorry."  Her voice had cooled dramatically the prickling against my skin lessened and relaxed a little.  "Aidan liked you.  I liked you."  She turned a shade of crimson just slightly lighter than her hair.  "I figured if you were a player at least I could feel..."  She stammered.  "I've not been with anyone since Aidan's father left me."

I didn't know what to say.  So I apologized.  "I'm sorry."  I sighed.  "It's not that I don't want to.  God, I want to.  But you have a son." I took a step from the wall and then another until I was standing behind the couch Stella was sitting in.  "I don't want you to find what you are looking for in me.  I'm not the kinda guy who's going to stick around.  You need that guy.  Not me."

Stella continued to look at the floor.  I took a deep breath and bent over Stella's small form then kissed the top of her head.  I could smell the sweet scent of roses and I could feel that small tightening in my body again.  I whispered against everything my body was telling me.  "I'm going to go now."  

I took a card out of my wallet and set it on the table near the door.  "Call me after your interview, let me know how it went.  If you move here maybe I can show you around.  Have a play date with Aidan."  I grinned at her.

Stella looked up at me with tears in her eyes.  Fuck!  I hated crying, I was weak when girls cried.  But she smiled at me.  "I'd like that.  See ya round Nox."

"See ya round, Stella."  I opened the door and hefted my things to my shoulder and I headed for the nearest stair well.  It was no where near time for Jace to pick me up.  I'd tell him I was stopping back at HQ and find my new room to stop by there.  But first I had to get as far away from the prickling fear that was chasing me down the stairs.
## Proposition

I dropped my gear off in my crap room.  It was a simple studio apartment layout with a small kitchenette, with two person table, a tv on the wall and a queen sized bed.  Everything in the room was beige - the most boring color in the world.  I had called Jace and he said he'd meet me here.  He wanted to know what happened, but I didn't want to talk about it. 

There was a knock on the door and I quickly answered it with my duffle bag and carry on from the plane in my hand.  It wasn't Jace.  It was a pretty little brunette with little red gem in the center of her head - one of our Indian natives it appeared.  Like humans the Venatori tended to pick up nationalities and heritages akin to the humans.  There was only one Indian family that I knew of which meant that this little fox was a Dowager.

"How can I help you Ms. Dowager?"  I asked.

"Oh, you know who I am?" she asked.

I shook my head.  "No, ma'am, just a guess."

"Oh.  Well I was told you were coming to town.  I have a proposal for you.  If we can talk in private."  

She was very confident I would say yes so I stood in the door way and said, "I've been back a few hours and already getting hit up with offers of breeding?"

She blushed.  "I'm sorry, but I wanted to be the first."

I sighed then stepped aside.  Come on in."

I dropped my bags at the door as she sat down at the table delicately.  I searched in my cupboards for glasses and found two and poured two glasses of ice water from the fridge and set one down in front of Ms. Dowager.  "I'd offer you something else but I just got in."

"Where you going somewhere?"  she asked nodding to my things.

"To my best friends place for a home cooked meal and some family time."  There was no reason to lie to her.

"I won't keep you long." she said.

I sat down across from her and leaned back against the back and waited for her to continue but she sat and watched me sipping at her water. "Your proposal?"

She nodded.  "I was just examining your features."

"Like cattle.  Thanks."  The sarcasm dripped like honey from my mouth.  I hated being treated like I was nothing more than breeding stock.

"Apologies.  I didn't mean to offend you."  She seemed sincere.  "I'm here to offer you my daughter."

"And what does she think on the matter?"  I asked. I wasn't exactly thrilled with pre-arranged marriages much less pre-arranged sexual partners.

"She asked me to speak to you on her behalf.  She just graduated from the Academy.  Your name has been floating about Academia and the Scrin.  And we beleive your line would be a great addition to our own."

"You do realize I am half human?"

She nodded.  "We are aware.  We have taken that into consideration.  The pure bloodline isn't a determinantal factor in this case.  You are Cesari.  The probability of Magnus is far greater than the small loss of potential ability.  You do not have Venatori speed, strength or agility if I'm to understand correctly.  But you possess our keen senses and from Ms. Rivera's report our senses are sometimes keener than our own.  You have an exceptional healing ability as we do despite being half human.  The lost abilities aren't a concern for a Scrin."    She was highly informed about me.

"And what do I get out of this?"  These things usually benefited all parties.

"Well.  An improved status.  A child to raise without interference with one exception."

"You mean your daughter doesn't want to raise her own child?"  I was shocked.

"You are correct.  Anabel doesn't wish to be a mother, but she wishes to remove her obligation to the Venatori as quickly as possible."  She sighed.  "We only want the child to be Scrin."

"I won't force my children one way or the other.  I can guide them in a particular direction but it is their choice not mine."

She sighed.  "The first child would be ours.   The second your line.  Both raised by you, two years apart."

"I see you have this all figured out.  What makes you think I want to raise children?"  I wanted to know why they thought this was compensation for my genes.

She smiled at me.  "I am aware of your issues with children raised by the community.  I don't expect you would let your children be raised by us as anymore than your father would."

"You know my father?"

"Of course.  Kai Viddens is a good friend."

"The two of you put this together then?"  I knew my father would interfer with my life.

She shook her head.  "No.  We did discuss you but I only did so because it was what my grandmother wanted.  Tradition between families."

"How long do I have to think about this?"

Ms. Dowager stood up and pulled a card from her small glittery handbag.  "You can call me anytime with your answer.  It is a good proposition, Master Sétanta."

I nodded and took the card.  "It is but I want to do my due dillenge as you have apparently done yours."

"Fair enough."  She headed for the door and smiled.  "A true Scrin.  You would definitely find a home among us if you so choose to chase the knowledge."

I laughed.   "I don't think I would be a very good scholar."  I walked her to the door and kissed her hand good-bye.  "It was a pleasure, Ms. Dowager.  I will be in touch."

Down the hall I heard a throat clear and I turned to see Mia Hill standing there in her pixie cut brown hair and a pair of holey jeans.  I laughed.  "Can't you find pants without holes?  I'll have to speak with Jace about upping your allowance."

Mia hugged me then stepped inside my room grabbed my bag and I picked up my duffle and shut my door behind me.  "I missed you Nox."

"I missed you too Mia.  Can't wait to have you cook for me."

Mia grinned back at me.  "Ditto.  I got dinner, you get breakfast."

I nodded.  "Sounds like a deal".## Family Time

Mia took the elevator and I went with her in the plate glass elevator.  She wasn't even tall enough that I could easily hide my fears against her body like I did with her husband.  But she wrapped her arm around my waist and leaned her body against mine - a comforting support hug.  I adored Mia.  She took care of me better than Jace did.  I was more than happy when Jace finally popped the question.

We'd known Mia for years upon years.  She was a year younger than us in the Academy and she ran in the same circle as us outside in the human world.  She like me was raised by the community.  Her parents were from way out west - Hawaii and couldn't live in New York as they ran the island's Venatori contingent.  And who wants to give up their post when your daughter becomes Magnus.  She didn't spark, but the ability came young and she's been her two years less than Jace and I.

She used to hate me.  Which meant she hated Jace.  That was until we ran into her in the same forbidden circles of the human world doing things her parents wouldn't be proud of.  We struck up a friendship and she of all things asked Jace out.  I was never jealous - Mia was never more than a friend to me.  Though we had shared a few moments of pleausre together though the circumstances were not something that we discussed at all.  

Mia squeezed my waist and brought me back to the real world.  "What you thinking about?"

I grinned.  "You and Jace.  How we met."

"Ah.  No wonder the litle drool coming out of your mouth."  I heard the humor in her voice but I had already reached up and wiped the non-existant drool from my mouth.  "Got you. Next floor we get off on.  We can take the stairs after that."

"Okay."  I straighted up and wrapped an arm around Mia's shoulders as she still clung to my waist for comfort.  "Jace is a lucky man."

Mia laughed.  "He is.  Isn't he?  Got me for a wife and you for a best friend.  Can't ask for anything better."

"I was talking about you, but yeah I guess he's got it made now.  Two perfect children, a loving wife, a best friend who's like his brother and house out in the suburbs."

"You sound almost jealous, Nox."  Mia pulled away and took a step back as the bell dinged open on our floor.

We walked down the Academy's lowest level where the day care facilities are and headed for Naya's class first.  I managed to say.  "I am, actually," just as Naya burst out of her class room with the other kids.  She skidded to a hault when she saw me standing there and walked casually up to her mother and gave her a hug.

"Hi Mom."  Mia nodded with a whisper, "Go ahead."

She didn't walk to me - she ran the few steps it took to get to me and jumped into my arms.  "Uncle Nox."

"Hey babe."  She wrapped her arms around my neck and squeezed tight.  I shifted her so she wouldn't be knocking my duffle bag into me the whole time and she settled into me like an old rag doll as we went to go get JJ.  

The toddler aged children were another cooridor over and JJ was happily playing with his friends until his mother gave a little whistle and his ears perked up.  His head lifted over the half wall separating the toys from the classroom and he hurriedly put his toys away when he saw me holding his sister.  If there was anything that boy hated it was sharing hugs with me.  

JJ didn't even bother with a Hi Mom as Naya had. He walked straight up to me.  He punched me in the thigh and Mia scolded him.  "We do not hit Jason Hill Junior.  You know this, even if it is Uncle Nox and he deserves it."

She winked up at me.  "Now because of that you don't get to see him until we get home."

I leaned my head back fighting the urge to say something but this was her son.  And I had no say in the matter.  She was right - no hitting, but I didn't even get a hug from the little man.

JJ startd crying as Mia hoisted him up on her hip with my backpack and we started walking towards the stairs.  "We can take the elevator, Mia.  It'll be easier."

Mia sighed with relief, I could see it written all over her face.  JJ was not making it easy.  Once in the elevator Mia had a private conversation with JJ in the corner.  I leaned against the wooden rail and buried my face in Naya's hair.  It smelled like lavendar which I knew both the younger the Hill's hair did.  It was something Mia did to calm them in their evening baths.  It was a calming scent though not enough to completely remove the anxiety from the elevator.  

Naya whispered in my ear.  "I got you, Uncle Nox.  Nothing to be afraid of."

I grinned across at her.  "Thanks babe."

Another group of parents got in the elevatore a floor down.  A small voice spoke up to us.  "Hi Naya."

Naya scrambled down from my embrace and stood a little under that little girl.  "Hi Cat."  Naya looked nervous.  

The little girl asked Naya, "Is this the boyfriend you are always talking about?"

I raised my eyebrow and Naya blushed.  But she didn't confirm nor deny the fact.  Not good.  What had she been saying?  I looked to Mia and she mouthed, "This is your fault."

I sighed and nodded.  It was.  I flirted with Naya as I flirted with everyone else.  Mia and Jace hadn't said anything when she was younger and once she got older it was difficult to stop.  I would fix this though.

The little girl continued to bully Naya.  "Isn't he a little old for you, what's he like 20?"

Twenty was old?  Damn, kids these days.  Naya was about to say something when I put my hand on her shoulder.  I knelt down and was eye level with both the girls.  "I'm twenty -nine thank you very much.  And I'm not Naya's boyfriend.  I'm her uncle."  I waved my hand in front of the girls and a small ball of fire winked into existance.  The little girl paled.

Naya spoke, "I told you he was good."  She sounded more cocky than I did.  Naya waved her hand like I had and a smaller version of the fireball winked into existance above her palm.  "I have the best tutor in the world."

The little girl stammered and sputtered.  "Mine is better."

Naya laughed.  "Highly doubtful.  Is he Cesari too?"

I stood up and let the fireball wink out as I covered her hand and extinguished Naya's too.  "Okay that's enough.  I am not some thing you brag about Naya."

I looked across at the other parent.  The little girl giggled, "That's my Nanny. She won't say anything to me."

I grinned.  "Please turn around ma'am."  The woman grinned and did as I asked.

I didn't touch the little girl but I flared my power around me and she felt the soffocating pressence.  "You bother Naya again and you will have to deal with me."

The little girl's eyes were wide with fear.  I could smell the aweful stench on her.  On everyone in the elevator.  The elevator dinged on the bottom floor and I pushed Naya ahead of me out the door - Mia followed.

It took me a few moments to reign in my presense.  It was a trick I'd learned so I didn't stand out.  Most Magnus didn't have that control.  But when control is beaten into you as a child you tend to remember such lessens.

Mia took a deep breath.  "Jesus, Nox."

"I'm sorry."  I really was I hadn't meant to scare them too.

JJ giggled, "That was awesome."

I gave him a half grin while we waited for Jace in front of the statue they had nicknamed Atlas.  I had created it when I was 10 - proving to the world that I was Cesari.

Naya asked, "Did you really make this, Uncle Nox?"

Mia nodded, "He sure did.  It was one of his greatest acheivements."

I smiled at Mia.  It wasn't an acheivement I was doing what I was told - art.  I didn't know that what I had done was near impossible - working all four elements at the same time.  Everything but the ants and the grass seeds I had created from nothing.  The large globe above his head was it's own little world.  I had applied our life cycle science to the globe - the greenhouse effect to make a completely isolated world inside the globe.  It sustained itself year round without any interference and it had for the past 19 years.

Jace came up and stopped before me and frowned, "Why do you feel so much more powerful right now?"  He looked at me with a disapproving glare, "What did you do?"

Naya stepped between me and her father with her hands on her hips.  "He was standing up for me."

"Cat?"

She nodded.  "She was picking on me about Uncle Nox."

I sighed.  "Which you need to stop calling me your boyfriend Naya."  I turned her around and knelt down.  "I love you.  You know this.  But you are my family.  That is what I am."

She looked hurt and I didn't blame her I had no tact.  Jace put his hand on his daughters shoulder, "You'll learn to live with it."

My heart sank.  He knew all too well the feeling of loving me without my feelings returned in the same way.  When we were younger Jace had wanted more.  More than just the friendship we had shared.  More than the shared experiences.  More than I could give him.  He was my brother, my family.  My only connection to the world that made life worth living.  He eventually understood why I couldn't be more.

Mia put her hand on my waist and guided me towards their car.  She walked slower than the others, Jace had taken JJ and my bag from her and was walking at a rather fast pace with Naya chattering away at him about what I'd done.  Mia spoke softly, "He understands yu know?"

I nodded.  "I know, but it doesn't hurt any less for either of us."

Mia sighed, "If you'd been with him, Nox.  He wouldn't be with me - not ever."

"I know that too.  You are one reason.  I'm the main one though."  I sighed.  "I do love him.  And it's not that I'm not attracted to him."

"He knows.  You come up often after you've been gone a long time.  And not during sex or afterwards.  Just randomly he'll curl up against his pillow away from me.  And when I ask him what's wrong - he just misses you.  Misses having you around.  You are staying for a while right?"  Mia sounded concerned, "He really needs you."

I nodded.  "That's the plan."  I stopped and turned towards Mia.  "I want to start my own family.  I want what ya'll have."

Mia's face lit up like a beacon.  "That's wonderful Nox."  And it fell nearly as fast.  "That means you have to let someone in."

"Yeah.  I'm thinking kids will be easier.  I've already been propositioned once and I'm assuming there will be more who want a possible Cesari in their bloodline."  I truly hated the world I lived in sometimes.  But it is what it is.

"Wow.  That was fast.  Who?"

"The Dowager line - Anabel's mother specifically came to me about her daughter."

"I know Anabel.  She's a sweet girl.  Heading off to nursing school like I did."

"I haven't given her an answer yet.  I want to do some digging."

Mia laughed.  "Of course you do."

We reached the car.  Naya and JJ were already inside.  But Naya was bouncing around the seat.  "I better get in before she hurts herself."

Mia nodded.  "They love having you here Nox."

"I know."  I got in and sat in the middle seat.  It was uncomfortable but I got to see both kids and they were more than happy to have me sitting there.  Which made it all that better.

Jace drove home and the adults up front held their own private conversation while I chatted with the kids.  I found out JJ was being a bully so we had a deep discussion about what being a better person meant.  I don't think he got it.  But I think he at least understood some of what I said to him.

Naya on the other hand was the one being bullied and I showed her how to do what I'd done.  To be threatening without actually threatening.  Her power was still new to her, but she was learning quickly.  Jace looked at me and gave me a frown in the rear view mirror.  I was teaching his children things he'd rather not have them know.  But what was done was done.  You don't unforget knowledge quite so easily.

The kids ran inside carrying my bags and Mia followed them inside.  "Dinner will be ready in an hour, you two."

We both nodded, "Yes ma'am" I said and Jace shook his head.

"You really shouldn't teach my kids that stuff."  Jace sighed, "JJ's already doing things we think he saw from you."

"Like what?"

"Viels in particular."  Jace said.  "He's always hiding things so we can't find them."

"On purpose?"  I asked.

"He says no, but..."  Jace trailed off rubbing the stubble at his chin.

I grinned at him.  "I can help with that.  I doubt he knows what he's doing.  It's an easy trick to learn and to not know you are doing it.  I did."

Jace nodded.  "You didn't specifically show him did you?"

I shook my head.  "Not on purpose anyway." I removed my personal veil I usually kept up and Jace nodded.  "Something I do out of habit."

Jace sighed, "I don't know why you just don't get those scars taken care of."

"That would make people ask questions.  Questions I don't want to answer."

Jace shook his head.  "I don't know why not.  Everyone who's seen them would love to know the truth."

"Noone would beleive me anyway."  I headed for the door.  "I'm going for a swim."

"It's like 50 out."  Jace called after me shutting the cargo door in the SUV.

"I can fix that, remember?"

I went for a swim and the kids splashed around in the pool with me.  Dinner was roasted chicken covered in herbs and a decadant lemon sauce with mashed sweet potatoes and a healthy serving of wild rice.  One of my favorite dishes Mia knew how to cook.  We chatted through dinner - school projects, me being home indefinately.  Mia offered me a place on her couch whenever I wanted.

The kids were sent to their rooms for homework and lessons and I went for a run. 

By the time I got back the kids were in bed and Mia and Jace were settling in themselves.  I took a shower then laid down on the couch.  I had an early morning.  I wasn't looking forward to getting up in front of smart people to talk about my theories.  Theories I could only bet the would laugh at.## Morning Ritual

My night started as any other - darkness.  The darkness filled with a red eire glow as my demons approcahed in the depths of my mind.  I could feel the tension rising.  I felt the air around me thicken as I was pushed against the wall that had not been there before.  

A flicker of light like lightning outside a window but no thunder followed changed the scene.  The darkness was replaced with billowing smoke that made it hard to breathe.  Shadows moved in the smoke but I couldn't make anything out yet - but I knew what they were. 
Tentacles of earth, air, fire and water slipped and slide over the surface of the earth as the red glow formed into a set of eyes glowing in the smoke.  I would never fully see the figure that tormented my dreams though I knew who it was.  I have always known.  

One tentacle of air reached me and I flinched in the glow of it's aura.  I could see the pattern that made it whole and I froze on instinct.  It slashed at my shirt and it fell to the ground in shreads.  The bile and the fear rose in my stomach I wasn't sure what was worse the nausea or the fear - both a product of my anxiety and nightmares.  My heart raced inside my chest.  It felts like it was trying to escape.  I wish I could escape.

A voice echoed in my head.  "There is no escape."

There were tentacles all around me and when the first lashed out I felt my skin flay.  The second and the third went deeper and I felt my skin knitting back together but the onslaught of the demon's tentacles left my back a bloody mess.  The glowing eyes moved closer, and with all the elements at once one final strick broke my silence and I bit back my scream falling.  I never fell...

I landed on the floor between the coffee table and the couch I had made my bed.  My back ached and my lip felt swollen.  I rolled on to my back and I could feel the wounds healing even know.  I touched my lip with one hand and pulled away blood, but the ache was slowly disappearing from there as my body healed itself.  

My back was a bloody mess.  Which meant that couch and floor would now carry stains of my blood.  Fuck!  How was I going to explain this to Mia.

A groggy figure stood above me and I frowned.  Mia asked, "You okay?"

I shook my head.  "Nightmares."

Mia frowned.  "I heard."  A small ball of illumenscent light formed over Mia's hand as she looked at the couch.  "That'll come out.  Let me see."

I didn't move but Mia stepped around the coffee table and knelt down before me and lifted my shirt.  "It's mostly healed now.  Nox, what's going on?"

I shrugged.  "I'm home."

Mia grabbed me by the shoulders and turned me around violently.  I fell backwards trying to scramble away.  Mia lifted her hands away from me.  "I'm sorry.  Talk to me."

"The first night home is always the worst."  I said in a small voice which made me think of the first time it had happened.  I was so scared, in so much pain as my body healed itself from self inflicted wounds.  

"What's going on?"  Mia whispered as she started crawling towards me.  I didn't move, she wasn't adding to the terror coursing through my veins.  She wrapped her arms around me and held me tight.  I collapsed into her embrace like a small child.  Mia was careful not to touch my back.

"Don't worry about it.  I'll talk with Margo soon."

"Come to bed, Nox.  We'll keep you safe."  Mia stood up and offered me a hand.  I turned and took it without thinking.  It had been a long time since I'd shared their bed and even longer in a platonic fashion.

Mia lead me by the hand to her bedroom and opened the door quietly and we slipped inside.  Jace was lying near the side of their king side bed.  Mia walked over and shoved him over he grumbled but he moved.  "What?" he said groggily.

"Nox had a nightmare."

Jace's eyes popped open and he move to the middle of the bed.  Mia crawled over him and laid down and drapped her head on his shoulder.  "I shouldn't"  I said.  "I will only wake up again."

Jace tossed the edge of the covers over and patted the bed next to him.  "We'll keep you safe, Nox.  Come on."

I sighed.  It was a lie, there was no safety in my dreams.  But the gester was nice.  I laid down next to Jace and stared up at the ceiling before Jace was tugging at me to join them.  I laid down next to him and felt the familiar warmth of his body against mine.  When were were kids he often slept in my bed.  It was like a comforting blanket I had forgotten.  Jace rolled on to his side away from me and I curled up against the length of his body and he Mia's.  My hand drapped over his hip and I felt Mia's underneath my hand.  I moved it aside but she grabbed it and pulled it over both of them.  She held my hand and I drifted off into the blackness again with ease.

The darkness wrapped itself around me.  A chaos of patterns bloomed in my vision.  Reds and greens shifted in swirls of Christmas vomit as the yellows and blue made horrid shades of green as they mixed and mingled.  Patterns became abstract like I was living in a world made by Picaso.  Fires started in every creavice of my mind.  Little children danced in bonnets and bayonets.  One flaying the other before there was nothing but puddles of blood sifting through the kalidescope of colors.

And then it was black again.  The shifting colors were there covered in darkness.  Things would bump against my extremedies.  The cool breeze blew against my skin and it felt plesant until it became ice cold and my skin froze in ribbons. 

The fires from before burned through the darkness until I saw nothing but the flickering flames and I felt their red hot heat through my dreams.  I could feel the sweat beading on my brow.  I wipes my hands across my forehead and they came back blood red.  I was too distracted by the red on my hands to notice the red eyes coming near and when I looked up I saw my nightmare face to face.  His eyes were no longer red and glowing but the amber brown I remember them to be.  He smiled down at me like days of old.  I tried to get away.  

I started awake as my shoulder fell.  My heart was racing.  And my shoulder ached from the fall to the floor but I didn't bother getting up.  Jace was looking over the edge, "You wouldn't wake up."

"Sorry." I stayed flat on the floor while Jace climbed to the other side of the bed and started getting ready.  I could hear his movements towards the shower without another word. 

Mia whispered, "Will he be alright?  Why don't you go help him?"

Jace gave her a quiet laugh.  "He doesn't want my help.  He never does.  Just leave him be, he'll get up once the panic has been righted.  Trust me, I know Nox."

Mia sighed, and in a raised voice meant for me, "You got breakfast still?"

I took a deep breath and sat up.  "Yeah I got it." 

I was up and moving out the door when Mia shook her head, "You might want to change your shirt first."

I took it off and turned it around it was covered in slashes of blood.  "I'm sorry about that."

She handed me one of Jaces from the nearby closet.  "No problem.  It wasn't your fault."

They at least beleived me to a degree.  What I would tell them anyway.  Neither of them were happy I never told them exactly what was going on.  But I couldn't bring myself to say it much less say it outloud.

I pulled the shirt over my head and went into Mia's kitchen.  If one thing was for sure Mia had a great kitchen.  She had a grill right in the middle of her stove top and I would have loved to cook a steak on it, but that wasn't on the menu for today.  The kids wanted pancakes, eggs and bacon when I was over.  They were still in bed right now.

I made breakfast from scratch - well I didn't cure the bacon or fetch the eggs, but the pancakes I made from scratch.  It was one of my own special recipes.  It was healthier than regular pancakes but don't tell the kids that or they'd have your head.

I started a pot of coffee which was a brand new unopened package of a high end coffee that I knew Mia and Jace only bought cause I was here.  It was one of the few things I splurged on even in the wilderness.  They had already ground it which was disapointing but the smell was awesome.  I couldn't wait to have a cup of it.

I started with the batter and got it all mixed up.  Mia had all the ingredients but then she had wanted me to cook too so I knew she would.  Jace and Mia's kitchen was set up perfectly - at least while I was around.  I had a habit of putting things in their places even if they weren't there before.  That was one of my annoying compulsions.  I didn't like disorganized things so I tended to fix them.  I wasn't a neat freak.  It wasn't dirt or dust that bothered me.  Just things out of place.  But I wasn't complex enough to have patterns or such in things.  Just order.  I was thankful my compulsions didn't push the OCD patterns.  No counting things that drop or washing my hands 100 times.  

I started the bacon in the oven on a rack and then started flipping pancakes.  The first few were messy as it had taken me a few tries to get my groove.  I hadn't made pancakes since I was here last and that was over a year ago.

I started hearing sounds coming from the hallway as the kids started to wake up and get ready for school.  At one point JJ was screaming and running down the hall butt naked.  I pointed at the hallway he'd come from and he sulked and turned around the other way and back into his bedroom to finish changing.  

Naya was sitting at the kitchen table watching me flip pancakes.  She was a spitting image of her mother.  Which was a good thing she didn't need to take after Jace.  But she was unlike anyone in her family - quiet and shy and completely reserved.  Not an ounce of showoff in her, which made me wonder what had gotten into her with the little girl in the elevator.  "Hey Naya."

She looked over at me as I started making the scrambled eggs in the frying pan.  "Yeah Uncle Nox?"

"Why did that girl bother you so much?"  I flipped another pancaked and Naya grinned as it landed with a soft splat.  

"She's always picking on me.  Says I'm ugly.  Says I'm stupid."

I sighed.  The last pancake was done and the eggs were starting nicely.  I beckoned her to me with a single finger and she came over and wrapped her arms around my waist and pressed her head into my stomach.  I patted her back.  "Naya."  I lifted her little chin and saw a small stream of tears.  "Oh Naya, baby.  You aren't ugly.  You are a beautiful little girl, just like your Mama.  And you aren't stupid.  And anyone who's calling you names is only jealous.  Baby, you are the greatest little girl I know."

I turned back towards the eggs careful of Naya's arms around me and finished the eggs.  I called down the hall, "Breakfast is on."

I looked down at Naya.  "Set the table please."

She skipped away, and I hoped that what I had said helped and didn't make the whole boyfriend thing worse.

Mia came out searching under things and in corners.  "Naya you seen JJ's shoes?"

She shook her head.  "No ma'am.  He hide them again?"

I started looking around and found a pecicular weave hiding behind the potted plant.  "Mia they are in the corner."

I called out, "Hey JJ.  Come here man."

He ran towards me in his stocking feet and tried to slide but the carpet in the livingroom didn't allow him to do that.  "Did you hide your shoes?"

He looked down at the floor and nodded his head.  "Why?"

"So I didn't have to go to school."

I lifted his chin to look at me as I knelt down.  "Are you using magic on purpose?"

"What?  No.  I don't know any magic.  Except the light you taught me."  JJ produced a no heat dim little light orb above his hand.  

"You sure that's all you know?"

He nodded emphatically.  "Okay I'm going to show you a veil.  But you can't used it to hide things.  If I find out you are doing it on purpose I will have your daddy take away everything in your room and you'll only have a bed to sleep in and clothes in your drawers and closet.  Okay?"

He nodded.  "Yes sir.  No hiding things with this veil."

"Particularly your school things.  Do you understand?"

He nodded again.  "Pinky swear."  He held out his pinky and we shook on it.

I crafted a hidden pattern that JJ could see.  He was a fast learner so I did it slowly and wrapped it around Mia's end lamp table.  It vanished from sight.  JJ's mouth fell open in an O and said, "Cool!"

I undid the pattern and it came back unharmed.  I could explain the mechanics behind it but a four year old wasn't going to understand the idea of bending light.

JJ tried the weave and managed to hide half the lamp and he giggled.  

"Looks like you can only do small things.  The weave will eventually wear off but you cannot do it to anything on purpose do you understand me.  And if they find your shoes under another veil after this remember nothing in your room."

"Even my night light."

I nodded.  "Even your night light."

He nodded as Mia sat him down on the couch and helped him tie his shoes.  She smiled at me.  "Thanks.  Hopefully that will help."

I nodded.  "Hopefully."

While their family ate I slipped in Jace and Mia's bathroom and grabbed a shower.  Mia came in while I was pulling on the pair of dress pants that I was going to wear.  "You weren't hungry."

"I'll eat small before I go.  Don't need to have too much in my stomach."  

I turned to the mirror and started applying the eyeliner under my eyes and Mia giggled.  "I knew you used eye liner."  She rummaged through my toiletry bag, "That's all."

"My lipstick is in the other bag."  I grinned and ran my fingers through my red tipped hair.  I probably should have dyed them back that out.  There was notime for that now.  

She laughed as Naya giggled behind her mom's leg.  "Uncle Nox do you really wear lipstick?"

"No ma'am.  Well I have.  But it's not a regular occassion.  And usually only when I really pushing the gay pride thing."

Mia smacked my arm.  "Nox.  She doesn't need to know that."

"Know what? that I like boys."

Naya giggled, "Mommy I know that already."

Mia shook her head.  "No, the gay pride thing - we don't diferentiate between sexual preferces."

I laughed.  "I wonder why."  I stuck my tongue out at Mia.

But it was Naya who commented.  "Because Daddy likes men too.  But he likes Mommy the most."

"He does at that."  I agreed.

Mia gave me that look that said I was wrong, but she didn't say anything with her daughter present.  It was really the only bad blood between us.  But it had only made us closer so not really bad blood.

I pulled on my dress shirt as Mia left and Naya stood in the doorway watching me.  "Uncle Nox, what are all those scars."

"Which ones?" I asked as I buttoned my shirt.  She came over and ran her fingers across my chest.  "Those are from a were bear that killed my mother.  He tried to kill me too."

"But he didn't.  I'm glad."

"Me too." I agreed.

I picked her up and sat her on the sink and started tying my tie.  She took it deftly in her hands and finished for me.  I watched her in the mirror and she did it perfectly.  I was impressed.  "Your dad let you do that for him?"

She laughed.  "Daddy can't tie a tie."

Jace must let her do it all the time because I know he can tie a tie, he has helped me on a number of occassions when my fingers were too shakey to be of use.

She wrapped her arms around me and rubbed my back.  The healing marks were still tender and I froze under her touch.  She smiled up at me.  "I'm sorry someone hurt you."

I grinned at her.  "It's alright hunny.  I'll survive.  I promise."  And I would.  It was everything I could do to survive my nightmares and fears and I would not let them beat me down.

But right now my biggest fear was two hours away and I hadn't even looked over my notes since the plane.
## Fear of Heights

Jace drove into New York and I sat in the back with the kids again.  They chattered at me and distracted me from the upcoming events that were making butterflies leap in my stomach.  I hadn't managed to grab anything to eat but Naya thought for me and picked up a few peices of bacon and pancakes for me.  She said the eggs were too messy for the car.  I nibbled at the pancakes and gave the kids the bacon to share between them.  

As we got out of the car they both gave me a hug with geasey finger tips and Jace had to hold my jacket while I got the smears off with air and water.  Mia laughed.  "Fancy dry cleaning."

I shrugged, it was nothing.  "You do what you have to in the field."

Jace laughed.  "How often did you need your suit cleaned and pressed in the field?"

I frowned.  "Funerals."

The humor drained away and they both knew I was specifically speaking about my mother's funeral, but there had been others.  Fellow hunters who had died in the area and I went to show their families support.  It was the least I could do when I was sent to clean up their mess.

We parked in lower parking garage and I hated it worse than most places in the AU building.  It reminded me of clinging in fear to the man who had started my nightmares.  It was not a happy place.

Jace and his family headed for the elevator as I hefted my bags on my shoulder.  They stood waiting for the elevator and I couldn't make myself do it right now.  My stomach was already doing flips and I was anxious about everything happening today I didn't need more.  "I'm going to take the stairs."

Jace nodded.  "I'll take your bags to your room so you can go straight there then.  Stop by the class if you can I want them to meet you."

I nodded and handed him my bags taking the folder of notes from my backpack.  "Thanks, man.  I'll try."

The elevator dinged and I watched as my only family went in and turned around and the little ones waved good-bye.  I hated leaving them even though I intended to stay here and they'd be in my life more now.  It still hurt watching them leave.

I headed for the stairs once the elevator doors closed.  I walked them casually to the lobby.  I wasn't in a hurry.  I had a little time.

I stopped in the lobby and sat down with a black coffee in front of the statue of Atlas and tried to focus on the words I needed to remember.  This was the biggest deal I'd ever done.  In the field I didn't have to give speeches.  And these people were way smarter than I was.  Who was I kidding?

A small sound made me look up and I saw Stella standing across the table from me.  "Fancy meeting you here."

I grinned up at her.  I tried not to flirt though, but it was hard.  "I told you I work here."

She nodded.  "I know, but it's a big place."  Stella pointed at the plaque on the statue, that says you made that."

I turned around though I knew she was pointing at Atlas and the little gold placque that they mounted to the base of the statue.  I shrugged.  "When I was a kid."

When I turned around Stella was staring at me, "What are you a virtuoso?"

I shook my head. "No."  I was Cesari.  But I couldn't exactly tell her that.

"It's beautiful.  Did you have help?"  She asked.

"No. It was an art project."

"You had to have help.  There is no way a kid could have made that.  It's so detailed."

I shrugged.  "You might understand later."

"What's that supposed to mean?"  She sounded offended.

I stood up and looked at the time on my phone.  I'd wasted too much time.  I held my hand out to invite Stella along as I headed for the elevator with my coffee and notes.  "If you are here for a job I think you are, then you'll come to understand."

"You know something about what I'm interviewing for?"

"Not specifically no.  I have a gut feeling and I trust my gut."  I grinned at her as I stood staring at her instead of the elevator door.  

The door dinged open and I waited for people to file out before stepping inside the plate glass death trap with Stella.  I caught a glimpse of her looking at me as I clamped my eyes shut.  Stella moved closer and took my hand in hers.  "I can see why you are afraid of elevators now."

"I've always been afraid of heights.  But this makes it worse."  I intoned in a soft whisper.  

We rose up in side the elevator and I could feel my fluttering increase.  We both got out at the top floor.  It was the main offices of the Infirmary and Venatori Headquaraters.  Stella smiled at me.  "I guess this is it.  Wish me luck."

"Good luck Stella.  You'll do great."  I kissed her cheek.

I could feel the anxiety rising as the conference area on the next floor up neared closer.  I took the elevator that was slightly more offset from the first one, it was behind a key carded turn stile but in reality it was a supernatural gate.  Technology and magic combined to freely let the supernatural pass through, humans required a key card.

I so wasn't ready for this.## Crushes

The elevator doors opened on the conference floor and there was a crowd milling about outside of the closed double doors.  My heart beat fast as I stepped on to the hard wood floors and I could hear the soft clicking of the souls of my fancy dress shoes on the floor.  It sounded like I had a tack stuck in the bottom.  

I stepped to the side and leaned against the wall and lifted the offending foot over my knee and saw the tiny metalic peice sticking out.  I rolled my eyes.  Glad I hadn't been barefoot when I stepped on it.  I had to use air and fire to get the peice out of the sole of my shoe.

I melted the small tack into a small ball of molten metal when someone cleared their throat to catch my attention.  I looked up with the small ball floating above my hand.  My face split into a wide grin.  I knew that face.  I hadn't seen it in many years.  He asked me, "Nox Sétanta?"

I nodded. "Yeah."

He breathed a sigh of relief through luscious lips.  I took a moment to remember the masculane features of the boy I remembered.  His mustashe and goatee were neatly groomed and kept at the perfect length.  He wore none of the makeup he had as a teenage - that was a surprise.  His hair was perfect.  I didn't know how he kept it so, even after he ran his fingers through it in fustration.  "Nox?"

I snapped out of my revelry and smiled.  "Sorry.  What did you say?"

He sighed and I could see the signs of anger flash across his face.  A small ripple of lines in his forehead and at the corners of his mouth.  I knew he didn't like to repeat himself - it had been one of the things that everyone in the Academy knew about Dorian Vega.  The quickest way to get under his skin was to make him repeat himself.  

"The presentation in front of you is running long.  Is that alright?"  Dorian repeated, the aggravation was clear in his voice.

I nodded. "Anything to prolong this."

Dorian smiled at the joke.  "You look nervous.  Come with me?"

I followed him through the crowd.  I had to break myself from watching him move.  He was graceful like a cat.  He didn't have the typical gay swagger of really out men.  He walked with the grace of a dancer like he knew what every muscle did and how to make it even more attractive.  He had always been the perfectionist.

We walked into an employee's only room and I was suprised to find it empty save for the couches and tables that made up this break room.  He turned to me, "Coffee?"

I held up my cup.  "I'm good, thanks."

He walked over to me and I could smell a soft scent of cinamon and vanilla coming off of him over the dark musk of his cologne.  I took a deep breath and closed my eyes and I let my self relax.  I sensed more than saw that he had offered me his hand, I took it it without opening my eyes and shook firmly.  He spoke softly, "I'm Dorian Vega - coordinator of this lovely event."  His hands were soft yet firm.  I didn't want to let go.

I nodded and opened my eyes and stared into his deep blue eyes.  "I know who you are.  I saved you once upon a time, a long time ago."  He slipped his fingers from mine trailing along my long fingers and I wonder if he had done that on purpose.

Dorian blushed and nodded.  "Yes.  I wasn't sure you'd remember me."

I grinned at him.  "One does not forget a goregous man landing on top of you."

The rose color rose higher along Dorian's neck it almost reached his ears.  He nervously looked away.  Awwww...

He took my folders from me and the paper cup my coffee had come in and set them on the end table nearby.  Then turned back to me.  "I never did get to properly thank you."  He straightened the shoulders of my jacket and adjusted my tie.  The feeling of his fingers against my shirt sent shivers up my spine.  I had had a crush on this man since before he'd been accidentally pushed over the edge of the roof and I dove over to save him.

"I'd like to get together over dinner, if that's alright to properly thank you for saving my life and talk about your theories."  Dorian sounded a littled awed at the last statement.

"Are you asking me on a date?"  I flirted.

Dorian never looked up from my tie that he was meticuoulsly straightening and retying.  "It's not..."  He paused and then looked up at me through lowered eyelids.  "Yes."

I grinned at him.  "I think we can manage that."

The door opened and Dae'lin stepped inside, "There you are."

I rolled my eyes as she turned me around and started straightening my tie again.  She pushed a lock of my hair that had fallen over my eyes and sighed at the red still tipping them.  "You still do this?"  

I rolled my eyes at her last statement and sighed, but ignored it altogether.  "Dorian just did that Dae'lin and I think he's better at it then you ."  I pushed her small hands from tie.  "So leave it be."

The small raven haired women who had been my mentor looked taken aback as she stared up at me from her 5 foot status.  I grinned down at her.  "Nice to see you too, Dae'lin."

She pushed me aside and looked to Dorian.  "How could you let that baffoon in there run over like this?"

I could feel the anger rolling off Dae'lin as she confronted Dorian but he kept his feelings in check.  "Dae'lin, your student here is fine with it.  He's not a child anymore.  You don't have to speak up for him.  He's more than capable of it himself."

"Yeah, Dae'lin.  What he said."  I grinned at them both.  I heard the doors open.  "Dae'lin, I think it's time.  Can you take my notes to the podium?"

She looked at me sideways.  "Are you trying to get rid of me?"

I nodded.  "Yes, ma'am."

She rolled her eyes and grabbed the folder of my notes and headed for the door.  "Don't keep them waiting too long, Nox."

"I won't," I reassured her.

I turned to look at Dorian.  "Sorry about that.  Can I call you later about those dinner plans?"

Dorian nodded.  "It doesn't have to be today.  I know you just got back in town."

I shrugged.  "Tonight's as good as any. I just don't know what little miss bossy pants has in scheduled for me after this."

"I don't have a card on me.  You can look me up in the directory."  Dorian suggested.

I pulled my phone out of my pocket and handed it to him.  "Call yourself."

He smiled at me and took my phone, his fingers brushing the back of my hand and I felt sparks ignite across my flesh.  I had to swallow hard or choke on the lust that had taken up residence in my system.  I watched as he called himself.  The phone in his pocket rang and then abruptly cut off.  He handed my phone back to me with a small smile, he was careful not to touch me again and I felt a stab of loss at the missed oppurtunity.

Dorian held his hand out and ushered me out the door to the stage entrance.  He turned me around and adjusted my tie one more time and dusted off my shoulders and smiled.  He ran one finger under the rogue colored lock of hair that had fallen back where I liked to reside over my right eye with a smile.  "I always did like it.  Good luck.  And just be yourself, you'll do great."

I'm glad he had more confidence in me than I had in myself.  I was still not ready for this.

## Being Myself

I took a deep breath and walked out on to the stage and stood behind the podium and then looked out over the crowd.  I saw Dae'lin standing near the closed double doors in the back and Dorian was walking down the aisle to th empty seat in the front row that said 'Reserved - Dorian Vega'.  His own personal front row seat.  I could see his small smile and a nod of his head as I watched him.  He was pushing me onward and upward.

I waited for him to sit down in his seat and I could feel a wave of grumbling start from the audience.  I closed my eyes and then opened the with a deep breath and started.  "This is all new to me - forgive my nervousness."  I picked up the first note on the podium in front of me and glanced down at it.  And I remembered Dorian's words - be yourself.  This wasn't me.  I set the paper down and stepped out from behind the podium.  One man stood up and spoke loudly.  "I knew this was going to be a waste of time."

I stepped forward and amplified my voice with a pattern of air.  "You are free to leave, but I assure you it's not a waste of your time.  Or I wouldn't be here."

I took another step forward and set off a light show of patterns that did nothing really, a soft rain cloud formed along the ceiling, lighting arced from beam to beam, a soft summer breeze rustled the papers in the audience.  I couldn't think of anything to do with earth that wouldn't make a mess so I didn't bother with a visible element.  "How many of you can see the patterns that make up all of these magnus made phenomenon."

A few hands rose up in the air - Dorian's included.

I grinned down at him.  "What if I told you I could teach you to bend those elements?"

The man who had gotten up to leave was standing in the aisle staring around at the phenomenon around him and he slowly rose his hand.  Then he spoke.  "I'd call you a liar."  But he moved back towards his seat.

"I would grant you that leaway.  But I can teach you to touch the elements you beleive you can't.  It's harder in individuals who have been taught already.  But in my neice and nephew I have done so with ease.  Their little minds are eager to absorb the patterns, your's and mine have been hardwired one way.  I just never did it the correct way from the beginning.  Atlas is prof of that."

There were a few nodding heads as people remembered I had created the peice in the lobby.  "Is anyone is willing to come up here with me and let me try to prove my theory in front of you?"

I pointed to the man who had gotten up to leave.  "How about you?  You are sceptical already that will make this all that much harder."

He shook his head.  "Come on." I urged him.  "Can we give him a round of applause to spur that desire to prove me wrong?"

Applause rose in the audience and the man sighed and stood up for the second time and started down the aisle this time.  I met him at the bottom of the stairs and whispered to him as I offered him my hand.  "I won't embarrass you.  I promise.  Nox.  What can I call you?"

He took my hand.  "Ben."

I smiled.  "Alright Ben.  Thank you for coming up on stage."

He mumbled.  "This better be worth it."

I smiled at him and ran my fingers through the wayward strands.  "Ben has kindly agreed to be our proof that I can teach him to touch any element he can see."

"Now Ben.  I'm going to tell you what I think your designation is right now. Have you told me, or do we know each other?"

He shook his head. "I didn't tell you nor do I know you more than a file on the computer."

"I'm sure that was quite the read."  I smiled at him and took a deeper look into his is aura of patterns.  They oscilated at differing frequencies depending on their strength and how many elements they could touch.  I can't see mine so I have no idea what it looks like, but I could clearly see Ben's.  "You are NAA3".

His jaw dropped and he mouthed, "How did you do that?"  He nodded his head in agreement.

I answered the question he had asked because I knew it was the same question on everyone elses mind.  "Every person resonated at a different frequency and the patterns and frequency determine what you are."

I drew in the air with a flaming pen, it left trails of color and sparks as I drew a diagram of the different types of oscilations and what they meant.  

"If you look carefully at everything in this plane you will see these patterns around every living objects and similar around inanimante ones."

"But that's a bit harder to teach in the time alloted.  I'll gladly sit down with you on a one and one basis if you really want to learn."

Ben nodded.  "I'd like to."

"We'll get that scheduled up afterwards.  Are you ready to touch fire?" I asked.

He nodded empathically.  They were starting to beleive me.

I smiled at Dorian in the front row and sat down in front of him on the stage and patted the area next to me for Ben.  I asked, "Can everyone in the back see alright?"

A chorus of yes sounded from the back and I went on.  "Ben you see the glowing red orb in front of me?"

He nodded as I formed it slowly and made sure everyone could see what I was doing.  At least every Magnus or Magnus indeterminate  I suspected there were alot of them out there today in the Scrin.

"Ben.  Think of the color red in your head.  Draw a mental line to the fire ball."  This will connect you to the element.  "Put everything else out of your head."

He tried and he failed.  "Try again.  Clear your mind.  Ignore everything else but the color red.  Don't worry about the people around you, or the next phone call you have to make when this day is over or on our next break."

I watched as the patterns changed around him and fire channeled into his body.  No one else saw it, they weren't watching as closely as I was.  I smiled at him.  "Try this."

I wove the simplest pattern available - a single simple flame.  I wove slow and precise so Ben could follow.  Above his palm sprang a weak but a single flame identical to mine.

The audience applauded as if we'd done something more than a simple trick that any child fire magnus could preform.

I stood up and clapped my hands together in applause.  "Let's give our new fire Magnus a a round of applause."  The crowd added to my applause and Ben hopped off the stage and headed to his seat.  "Thank you Ben."

"That simple trick can link you to the power of the element.  A child can do it because they don't know the hard parts about bending elements yet.  My nephew has been randomly veiling things.  Today I showed him how to do it and he picked it right now.  The younger the mind, the faster the learning.  But it doesn't mean people older than Mark Green our illustrious leader can't learn to bend all four elements if they can see them."

"I assure you that even an Erudite Magnus can pick up all four elements.  It will probably be much harder, but the capability of seeing all the elements is there for everyone.  You just need to retrain your eyes to see them."

I closed with my contact information. I gave them my email address and Dae'lin's as well just in case.  "If you are interested in anything we've talked about today email me or Dae'lin and we'll schedule a time in the next few weeks to go over those topics on a one and one basis."

I walked off the stage happier than I had been when I had started and I didn't make a fool of myself.

## Fire and Bombs

I didn't get far before the blaring of the firealarm startled me and sent a sharp spike through my body.  It was a gut reaction but I was already walking towards the siren.  Not away like everyone else.  Most people abandoned the building when the fire alarm went off.  But each alarm in the AU building was unique.  There was a normal fire alarm that belched out four short burst then a small pause before repeating itself.  It said there was a fire and it needed you to evacuate immediately.

But this wasn't that type of alarm.  When you run an academy for young magnus there was always the off chance that one of them could spark accidentally.  The five bursts were unique to a firestarter started fires and the bursts directly following it indicated the floor, then a small pause told you which wing and area it was in.  The building was laid out in a grid.  To the uneducated it sounds like a normal fire alarm so humans were left to evacuate - only those who lived here really understood the subtle differences.

I found myself in the common area, but I wasn't the first hunter on the scene.  I frowned the moment I saw the back of an older man with peppered brown hair, that used to be the color of my own - my father.  He was speaking to an older version of Dorian.  I had forgotten that his father was my father's partner.  They had worked together since the Academy and if I were to trust the information around they were best friends.

I was about to leave when I let my senses drift and saw floating patterns around the scene that were not connected.  It was like leaves fluttering in the wind.  A man walked through one and it disappaited.  I yelled.  "Hold."

Everyone in the vicinity froze and turned in place to look at me, my father included.  The man who had just walked through one stood next to me and looked curiously at me.  "What?"

"There are stray patterns floating around.  The remenants of the pattern used here."

I looked around and saw all the hurt people.  "If you want to preserve them quickly I  need someone who can remember every detail quickly."  

My father's best friend reached into his pockect as he spoke.  "I know someone."  He started dialing while my father glared at me.  But he said nothing.  Everything was in limbo until we could do something about it.

I started directing people around me to clear the scene.  I gave them directions and they followed them to the letter.  It was a little like the childhood game simon says.  I managed to clear most of the unneed people and cleared the medics to do their jobs in a more convinent place.  They hadn't wanted to move the worst victim - who I sadly knew.  He was my half brother.  He looked up at me in pain, the burns covered half of his body and most of his face.  

I hadn't done this in a while but I fed my half brother all four elements.  I poured them into his wounds and the medics at his side jaw dropped.  They turned to look at me and asked, "What are you doing?"

"Healing, Nick. So shut up and let me work."  It took a lot out of me to do this for such extensive injuries.  I had only healed one such injury to myself before.  It wasn't my first burn, but it was the only one that I didn't have any evidence of its presence.  I was thankful.  I could hear Nick's breathing getting better and the pain in his eyes lessened until he was smiling up at me trying to sit up.

I put my hand on his once scorched chest to keep him lying down.  "Not yet."

The medics didn't do anything as they watched his wounds knit together.  But then they started questioning me.  "How are you doing this?"

There was a tap on my shoulder and I turned to find Dorian standing behind me with a grim frown.  "You needed a photographic memory?"

I nodded.  I pulled the gurney Nick was on and manuevered it through the maze of patterns that were still floating in the air.  "Yeah."  I left the medics to tend to Nick for the rest of his injuries.  He'd live and heal perfectly but I hadn't finished, and now I was feeling a little faint.  Not eating breakfast was paying a toll on me now.  "Can you memorize what the patterns look like and draw them?"

Dorian shook his head.  "The patterns are too intracate.  There is no way I can remember that.  Some are weaker than others."

I nodded.  "Alright, take pictures of the scene.  Memorize where the patterns are floating but don't disturb them."

Kai stood where he had been when I first saw him.  Emilio was already discussing something in a safe area.  I walked over to him and said, "We can deal with this later."

Kai just nodded and followed the same path is father had.  He hadn't said anything to me.  Nothing.  I was surprised.  I wasn't sure what was going on.

I waved my hand, it was a flourishing gesture I used when I was showing off.  I hadn't done it in years but it had been a trick I used when I was around all these people.  In my hand I created a peice of charcol and colored it red first and started drawing on the nearest wall the fire patterns, and blue for water, yellow for air and brown for earth.  Dorian was on my heels.  He was watching what I drew and making mental note of where they were in relation to things.  I hoped his memory was that good.

We worked systematically drawing the patterns and then wiping them from their measely existance until we had completed the job.  Dorian leaned against the wall with a smile.  "Now I guess we have more to talk about over dinner."

I grinned at him.  "I guess we do."

The man who had destroyed the first pattern walked up to us.  "Sorry to interrupt, but is it clear.  We'd like to get this place straightened out."  And he nodded his head in the direction of a group of people who were not so patiently waiting for me.  I had done the unthinkable - I healed someone.  A feat unknown to Magnus.  I didn't want to talk to them.

So I did the next best thing.  I grinned at Dorian and sucked the air from my lungs and passed out in oblivion.

* * *

The darkness left and I started hearing a voice that I remembered and a small smile splayed on my face.  "It's been 15 years since he last tried."  The soft voice of Margo's receptionist spoke in a hushed whisper.

"Are you sure?  He did that on purpose."  Dorian!

I opened my eyes and sat up, my head hurt.  Megan turned to look at me.  "Nox what did you do?  Mr. Vega here is certain is was more than lack of food."

I gave him a lazy grin.  "Sorry.  Yes Megan.  I did it on purpose.  It was a combination of lack of food but mostly lack of oxygen.  There was a mob of people wanting to talk to me, I didn't think I could handle more people than I had already dealt with today."

Dorian was frowning at me.  "So you fake fainting?  You don't have to suck the oxygen from your lungs like that.  I would have caught you either way."  

I couldn't help but smile at that knowledge.  "Faking fainting only works if you can keep a straight face while people fuss over you.  And I didn't think I could manage that feat with you standing there."

Megan looked at me and grinned and stepped into Margo's office to consult with her.  She had been on the phone the entire time with the medics fending them off - saying I was unavailable until cleared by her.

At least that was a good development.  I stood up but when I did I swayed and faster than I could blink and try again Dorian was at my side.  He had an apple and a bottle of water.  I grinned at him.  "Those aren't edible."  

Margo's office was littered with apple relics - and a fake apple tree in one corner and a bowl of apples sat on Megan's desk.  Dorian bit into it and there was a surprisingly wet smack to it.  I knew shock ran across my face.  For all these years I had thought they were fake.

Dorian smiled at me and handed it to me.  I looked at it and stared at it for a moment before my stomach rumbled loudly and I took the sweet smelling apple.  I didn't usualy like eating apples.  I bit into it and was surprised to find it was deliciously sweet and crunch.  Dorian spoke softly, "I brought it with me."

I grinned at him as I took another bite.  I chewed slowly watching Dorian watch me.  I swallowed carefully and said.  "I knew they were fake."

Dorian chuckled but it faded quickly and he frowned.  "Please don't do that again."

I nodded.  "Okay.  I panicked."

Dorian held a finger up to stop me from speaking I bit into the apple again to show him I understood.  I wasn't quite so showy with the rest of apple.  Dorian let me finished eating the apple before he offered me the bottle of water and a napkin.  I took both and wrapped the apple core in the napkin.  Dorian held out his hand and I laughed.  " can through it away."  

He nodded.  "I know.  I got it."

I carefully placed it in his palm avoiding touching him as I stared into his deep blue eyes.  I wanted to kiss him...

Dorian stood up and I watched him walk away as I cracked the bottle.  My eyes were drawn away from Dorian's backside when I heard the familiar clicking of Margo's high heels.  I turned and looked at her.  The scowl present on her face indicated her anger at me.  Dorian was standing just behind her waiting for her to do what she was going to do.

"Sorry, Margo." I appologized.

"What are you sorry about Nox?"  There was white hot fury in her words.

"A lot of things apparently.  I'm sorry I worried Dorian.  I'm sorry I sucked the oxygen from my lungs to fake a collapse.  I'm sorry I worried you and Megan.  I'm sorry I made you fend off the people I didn't want to deal with because I'd had enough of people for the day.  I'm sorry I healed Nick.  Well I'm not sorry about that.  I'm sorry I did it in front of everyone so now I have a horde of people wanting to talk to me about more than just my paper.  Does that cover it all?"  I looked up at her waiting on her verdict.

"Are you truly not going to do it again?"  Margo asked.

I looked behind her at Dorian and nodded my head.  "Yes.  I said I wouldn't do it again."

"Why should I beleive you?  This isn't the first time.  Just the first time you've been caught."

I looked up at Margo.  "I said I wouldn't.  And I try not to lie to the people in this room."

Margo looked back at Dorian and stared at him for several moments.  Dorian just stood there letting her, though I could see the confusion on his face.  He didn't know of the crush I had years ago.  Margo did.  She looked back at me and raised an eyebrow in question.  She didn't have to say anything I knew what she wanted to know.  She wanted to know that if I had feelings for him or if I was playing games with Dorian.  I leaned back against the couch and looked up at her in all seriousness.  "Never before."

She nodded and turned to Dorian.  "I leave him in your care.  He needs to eat.  I'd take him out of the building, I can't fend the medics off much longer."

Dorian nodded.  I wondered why Dorian would agree to being my guardian for the day.  Had he carried me here alone?  He carried me...  I swallowed hard.  I wasn't exactly ready to deal with what I felt for this man.  He looked at me, "Never before?"

I grinned up at him and wrapped my arm around his waist and pushed him forward.  "I'd like to leave now."

He took the hint and opened the door and held it form me placing his hand at my wasit as he did.  It dropped the moment I was through the door.  He lead me down the stairs he said. "I don't suppose that they'll be lurking in the stairwells."

I laughed. "If they know me they will.  But I doubt anyone knows me that well - short of Jace."

Dorian smiled.  "I knew that.  I was surpised this morning to see you entering from the elevator."

"You seem to know a lot about me, that isn't in my files."

Dorian nodded.  "The latter fact came from Dae'lin and Margo in turn when I invited you to the conference I did my research so that I could make you as comfortable as you needed to be.  I didn't know much about you when we were younger.  Short of the hair and make up and the fact that you presented ..."  Dorian was fumbling for a word.

I grinned.  "Gay?"

"Yes.  I didn't want to offend you.  I know there have been women in your past."  Dorian sounded embarrassed by the fact that he knew that.

"Well thank you.  I know a little place not too far from here, if you want to join me for lunch.  I'm starving.  We can talk about what you asked me about and the scene upstairs."  I added quickly.  "That is if you have time.  You don't have to babysit me like Margo suggested."

He smiled.  "I've got to eat too."

## Pumpkin Pie

We walked through the stair well in relative silence, the echo of our footsteps the only sound.  I don't think either of us knew what to say.  It was fairly clear that this was new territory for both of us.  At least with in the walls of the Venatori.

I broke the silence.  "I need to go to my room and grab my laptop."

Dorian nodded and the silence became deafening.  The awkward moments didn't stop as I stepped inside my room quickly to grab my laptop bag and we started back down the stairs.

When we reached ground level Dorian opened the exterior door and it was like the light changed him.  His hand went for my waist as it had every other time he'd preformed the chivalrous act, but this time instead of removing it once I was clear of the door it remained against my waist for several moments longer until we had to pass through the gap in the gate which  Dorian frowned at me about.  "We can walk around to the front."

I grinned at him.  "What's the fun in that?  This is closer."

We walked across the street waiting for the crossing signal of course, but we still almost got ran over by an errant cabby making an illegal turn.  His fare must be precious.  There was a small hole in the wall dinner around the corner from the Apex building.  Dorian looked at me with concern.  I smiled.  "Trust me."

I opened the door from him and Dorian stepped through with the tinkling bell.  A hearty welcome was shouted from behind the counter.  I stepped in behind Dorian and let the door close behind me.  Dorian took only a few steps inside and I walked into him.  I enjoyed the feel of the length of him against my chest and thighs.  "It's okay, they don't bite."  I whispered, "Not unless you want them to."

Dorian nearly choked.  I stepped around him and took his hand in mind.  A plump waitress looked up as she saw me aproaching and I the smile on her face grow as she welcomed me in with her smile.  Her accent was thick.  She was a clear Brooklynite displaced here in the City now.  "Why isn't it Nox.  Been a long time boy."  She reached across the counter and rubbed the neatly grown goatee on my chin.  "I almost didn't recognize you."

She glanced at my hand holding Dorian's as I asked, "My usual table taken?"

She laughed and looked around.  "Does it look like we are busy?"

I smiled.  "Unsually so.  You have two fine customers waiting service."

She laughed and cleaned her hand on her apron and offered it to Dorian.  "Bonnie.  What brings a fine upstanding citizen like yourself into my establishment with this rabble?"

Dorian let go of my hand and took hers in his to shake.  "He's hungry.  Dorian."

Bonnie stepped around the counter and lead the way to my favorite booth.  It was in the back and away from foot traffic so I wouldn't be disturbed while I studied.  She held out her hand inviting us to sit.  "Just like you left it.  We've missed seeing those books scattered all over the table."

I grinned and dropped a bunch of papers on the table, my folder from earlier.  "I'll bring some memories back for you."

She set two menus on the table and we sat down.  Bonnie indicated she'd be back in a few moments leaving Dorian and I alone for a moment.  Dorian picked up the menu and I watched the face he made.  He then looked up at me, "What?"

"Nothing.  I like watching you."  I could feel heat rising in my chest as I admitted the truth rather easily.

Dorian smiled and went back to reading the menu.  "What's good?"

"The pie."

He put the menu down and dropped a level gaze at me.  "You will eat more than just pie."

"Yes, sir."  I grinned playfully at him.  "I was planning on it but you asked what was good here."

"So nothing else is good?"

I shook my head just as Bonnie appeared from the kitchen and set down two glasses of water full of ice and a bowl of corn chips and salsa.  "Alfred said you better try the salsa."

I looked up at her and nodded.  "Yes ma'am.  I'll have my usual."

She looked to Dorian.  "For you?"

He frowned and then looked back at me.  "Trust me."

Dorian nodded.  "I'll have what he's having."

Bonnie nodded.  "Sounds wonderful, you won't be disappointed."  Bonnie took our order to the kitchen.

I took the spoon from the setting next to me and tried the salsa as I had been instructed.  I tilted my head and shrugged it was alright.  I was missing something.  

Dorian smiled.  "Don't eat corn chips?  Are they offending?" 

I grinned back at him.  "Fried food of most sorts and I don't agree."

Dorian nodded and I could tell he was filing that away for later as he muttered, "I'll have to remember that."

Bonnie returned with freshly made rasberry lemonade with real fruit none of that fake powder shit.  She set a glass down for both of us.  "If the drink is not suited to you Dorian.  Let me know and I'll get you whatever you like."

Dorian looked up at her.  "This is fine, but a chocolate milkshake over there looks divine."

Bonnie raised an eyebrow and smiled.  "A man after my own heart.  Coming right up.  It's been a very long time since Nox had one of these.  I almost have the gall to bring him one too.  But I'm afraid it would just melt."

Dorian nodded.  "I'll get him to try mine."

Bonnie leaned in and whispered.  "His weakness is chocolate I'll be sure to make it extra chocolately."  She got up and smiled at me and then went to make the shake.  She didn't know I had heard.

"You heard that didn't you?"  Dorian asked.

I nodded.  "Extra chocolately."

Dorian chuckled, "She doesn't know what you are?"

I shook my head.  "None of us.  She's a regular old human who's been working here for years.  Her mother owed the joint.  Now she does."

I pulled out my laptop and set it on the table and was thankful all the pictures were in my email when I turned it on.  I didn't want to have to spend the time to upload them from my phone.  

Dorian shook his head.  "Right to work, eh?"

I looked up at Dorian.  "I thought that was what you wanted."

"The case is depressing."  Dorian said flatly.  He smiled.  "Let's talk about you."  A small flash of red crossed his cheeks as he continued.  "How you see the world.  I want to know how you do it."

I smiled.  "I do like talking about myself."

Dorian nodded, "So I've heard."

I laughed.  "You really did go around asking people about me?"

"Yes.  I had a very long conversation with Jason Hill.  He was informative."

"Was he now?"  I was sure Jace was not very informative in the sense that Dorian wanted.

Bonnie stopped at the table and set a foaming and frothy frilly glass of chocolate in front of Dorian and dropped two more straws on the table.  "Here you are sweetie.  I'll go check on your order."

Dorian stuck the straw in the mass of frozen chocholate with chocolate swirls dropped on top to make it look even fancier.  He pushed the drink towards me.  He didn't say anything just stared at me with a knowing smile on his face.

I took a deep breath and took a swollow of the overly sweet concocation.  I was not a big sweets eater but Bonnie was right, chocolate was my only weakness.  It was cold and I had an instant ice cream headache.  But it was divine.  I pushed it back towards Dorian.  He raised an eyebrow, "And?  Would you like to share?"

I shook my head.  "No.  It was good, but it'll ruin my lunch."

Dorian laughed.

Bonnie brought out two plates of pumpkin pie first.  There was a douse of whip cream on them both, one was much smaller and I knew it was mine.  Bonnie had been serving my food for over 20 years she knew exactly what I wanted and how I liked it.

Dorian shook his head, "Ruin your lunch?  Pumpkin pie?"

Bonnie smiled.  "It's his favorite.  And it's protocol to eat desert last.  Thus our not so little rebel here eats it first.  I take it he didn't want more?  Ruin his meal?"  Bonnie rolled her eyes.  "He'll finish the pie, and eat lunch and still be hungry."

"That was along time ago Ms. Bonnie.  I don't eat quite as much as my teenage self did."

I took a bite of the pumpkin pie without any whip cream and closed my eyes.  It was sweet and spicey and perfect.  The texture was smooth and I was in heaven.  I had missed this.

When I opened my eyes Dorian was watching me and Bonnie had left to see to other customers.

"I take it that means it was worth the wait?"

I nodded.  "Yeah.  I missed this."

"Do you want mine?"  Dorian asked.

I shook my head.  "No that's okay.  It'll ruin the rest of the meal."

Dorian laughed.  "You can take it with you then."  He lifted the chocolate milk shake .  "This is plenty enough to ruin my own meal."

I could feel the smile on my face.  I would gladly take the pie home.  Dorian had no idea how much I liked it.  But from the happy grin on his face he was getting the idea.

We didn't speak at all while I enjoyed the pumpkin pie.  I could feel Dorian's eyes watching me take each bite and savor it.  I wondered what was running through his head.  "Penny for your thoughts?"  I looked up to find him stirring the milkshake absently staring at me.

He smiled when my eyes met his.  "Just watching you enjoy."

I put on my best cocky grin and leaned forward so I whispered so only Dorian could hear.  "I'm sure there are more fun things I could let you watch me enjoy."

Dorian's face turned a shade of red I didn't think possible as he looked down.

I took a deep breath and reached across the table and touched Dorian's hand.  "I'm sorry.  My mouth gets away with me sometimes."

He looked up and I could see the lust in his eyes.  "There is no need to apologize.  My thoughts were running a smiliar line."

I cocked my head with a grin.  "Oh really?"  The thought that he wanted me was a huge turn on and I couldn't help but bite my bottom lip.  It was something I rarely did.  More of that shy awkward boy who was new to the whole thing.

Dorian whispered.  "You shouldn't do that."

"Do what?"

"Bite your bottom lip."

"Why?" I asked confused.

"Because it maks me want to bite it, " whispered Dorian in a husky lust filled voice.

My stomach rumbled just was I was about to tell him we could go someplace else.  

Dorian laughed. "I guess that means we stay here a little while longer."

I nodded.  "Guess so.  Rather disappointing."

Dorian put his hand on top of mine.  "Not disappointing.  Prolonged."

I smiled.  There was no question about this.  He wanted me as bad as I wanted him.  

Bonnie chose that moment to bring our lunch to us.  It was a steak with a garden salad as a side and asparagas roasted with lemon and garlic.  I hoped it tasted as good as it smelled and better than I remembered it.

Dorian looked up at Bonnie, "This wasn't on the menu."

"Never is."  She said.  "But he's one of the best regulars we had.  It was a special when he was young and my mother cooked for him.  We still make it for the regulars that remember it."

"I will have to remember that."  He smiled and took a bite of the asparagus and let out a soft moan of enjoyment.  It sents all kinds of feelings through my body.  Dorian said.  "It's delicious.  I can see why Nox likes it here."

Bonnie smiled.  "And for other reasons.  But yes the food is one."

I laughed.  "Go away now."  I added.  "Please."

Bonnie did as I asked but Dorian caught my attention.  He looked like he almost wanted to scold me and I frowned.  "What was the other reason you came here."

"Other than the food and to study? you mean?"  Dorian nodded.  "A guy I was screwing around with worked here."

"Oh."  Dorian started eating and I didn't know what to say now.  I watched him for several minutes trying to think of something to say but I couldn't so I started eating.  As soon as I wasn't looking at him anymore and my fork hit my plate he said.  "Does he still work here?"

I shook my head.  "No.  He hasn't stopped working here when he went to jail."

"Why did he go to jail?"  Dorian sounded shocked.

"He was a pedophile. Got caught."

"How old where you?"  

Dorian was angry now.  I could hear it in his voice and see it in his face when I looked up.  "Old enough to be his victim.  But I wasn't.  I wanted everything we did together."

"Is that why you wanted Bonnie to leave?  So she'd not say anything?"

I shook my head.  "No.  If you asked I wanted to be the one to tell you."

"Why?"

I looked down at my plate and moved the peices of steak around on my plate before I looked back up to met Dorian's eyes.  He was standing up ready to leave.  "I don't beleive in lying to people I want more with."

"More?  What the fuck does that mean to you?"  

Dorian was still standing and I looked down at my plate.  "More means more.  Not just sex.  Not a romp in the sheets.  I want other things than I did when I was home last.  Or here ever.  But my past is full of shit like this Dorian.  If that fact makes you uncomfortable, it's probably best it doesn't go father then this."

Dorian turned and walked away.  I watched him but he didn't go to the door he want into the kitchen and I could hear him and Bonnie talking and Alfredo chiming in every so often but I couldn't make out what they were saying.

I fought the urge to curl up in a ball like I used to do when I was a little boy and be the frightened kid who used to come here and wait for his friend to show up.  I had wanted everything.  He didn't tell me to say that.  I wanted to be loved.  I know that now.  And I know it was abuse and I was a victim.  I know that now.  But Dorian didn't give me a chance to explain myself.

When Dorian returned my plate was clean and my glass was empty.  He sat down, he looked calmer and he started eating.  I leaned against the wall and put my feet on the bench and tried not to pull my knees to my chest.  I wanted to.  It was comforting.

Dorian spoke softly.  "Bonnie explained."

"Did she now?"  I wasn't happy that he went to someone else for information about me.  His research into me was starting to piss me off.

"I didn't know how bad off things were for you as a child." I didn't look at Dorian.  I didn't want to cry.  I didn't want to remember the things I did.  "Bonnie told me, that you were his first vicitim.  She turned him in."

"I know.  I was pissed at her for months."

"Why?"  I could feel the judgement in his voice.

I looked up at Dorian and slammed my feet on the floor and hit my knee in the process.  "Because it was the closest fucking thing I had to love at the time.  Dylan had beaten the shit out of me two weeks prior for kissing him.  My mother left me with a fucking pschyopath and my father could give a flying fuck about me.  I was feeling rejected, and just plain depressed.  He was nice to me, and it was better than slitting my wrists.  He helped me through a difficult time.  He was the first man I had sex with."

"Nox.  He raped you."

"You don't rape someone who wants it.  I don't care if you think I was too young to understand the ramifications.  I understand he abused me.  He hurt me in more ways than one.  He only added to the shit I deal with on a daily basis and its my own fucking fault.  So don't get on your fucking high horse and tell me what happened.  I fucking know.  I've dealt with it.  I've learned from it.  I'm not fucking in therapy so I can sleep on the couch or ramble on about how my life is shitty.  I deal with my fucking problems."

"Maybe you are right?  Maybe this should end here."

I felt the sting of tears in my eyes.  Rejection.  I turned and leaned back against the wall.  "It's not what I want, but if that's what you want. Fine."

"What do you want?"  Dorian's voice was calm and caring and he sounded like he really wanted to know.

I stared out past the end of the booth watching Dorian from the corner of my vision.  He was sitting again and watching me.  I felt the first tear fall.  And before I knew it more were falling.  I wiped angrily at my tears with the back of my hands  Black lines smeared across my hands.  I was going to look like a freak show after this.  Dorian stood up and sat down on my bench and picked up my legs and placed them over his and he moved closer.  His hand touched my cheek and he wiped away the tears.  "Why does that question make you cry?"

I looked down and closed my eyes.  But Dorian lifted my chin with his fingers and wiped away the tears and cleaned the smeared make under my eyes.  I grinned at him.  I didn't want to tell him the answer to either question but I did anyway.  "I want my own family."  It was just a hoarse whisper but I told him my deepest desire. "I want to be safe and loved and wanted."

Dorian asked, "How long did it take you to figure this out?"

"Until recently.  It's why I'm home for a while."

"That's what you meant by more?"  He asked.

I nodded.  The tears stopped flowing and I couldn't look Dorian in the eye.  His fingers pulled my chin in his direction.  "What's wrong?"

I shook my head.  I didn't risk opening my mouth otherwise a sqeaky voice sound off that nothing was wrong.  I hated being weak.  We sat in silence for a long time.  Dorian poked at his plate and I stared off into nothingness thinking about my shitty childhood.  I had only made matters worse most of the time.  

Dorian finally broken the silence and wallowing in self-pity.  "Can I ask you a question?"

I shrugged.  Dorian whispered, "You said your mom left you with a pshycopath.  What did you mean?"

I frowned.  I had blurted that out in the midst of the anger that had risen inside of me and Dorian remembered everything.  If he didn't bring it up now, he'd do so later, so I had better just tell him.  "My first mentor abused me - beat me.  But it's neither here nor there, there is no proof to what I say."

Bonnie stood at the end of the table and frowned.  "Except the scars on his back."  She set down coffee and some water for us and picked up the empty dishes.  "I didn't mean to interrupt.  I'll go now."

Dorian looked at me and stared like he was seeing an alien.  I looked away I didn't want to see his deep blue eyes feeling pity for me.  "Technically, I did that to myself."

Dorian asked, "What do you mean?"

I put my legs back over the bench properly and turned my back to Dorian.  I pulled the dress shirt from the back of my pants and lifted it to show Dorian.  "Technically it was my ability that did that.  He made me hurt myself.  He beat me in my head everyday until I hurt him back."

"A dreamwalker?"

I nodded.  "Yes. I learned how to control my ability though."


Dorian dropped my shirt and turned me around to face him.  "Shit, Nox.  Is there anything else horrible you want to drop?"  He smiled slightly he really didn't want to know more, but he was making a small joke of it.

I smiled back and shook my head.  "Not right now.  That's probably enough for a first date."

Dorian laughed, "Is this a date?"

I smiled.  "You said it was."

"I remember."

I took a sip of the coffee, it was as horrible as I remembered it to be.  I looked over at Dorian and wished this had gone better.  "I need to vent some of this anxiety."
## Demons Behind Orange Doors

Dorian asked me, "What do you normally do?"

I grinned.  "Throw fireballs."

He smiled.  "You could show me how."

"Really?"

He nodded.  "Testing your theory.  Even though I've seen it in action.  Nothing better than doing it yourself."

I nodded and he got up and dropped a hundered dollar bill on the table.  I could feel the shock in my wide eyes.  He only smiled at me.  "It was worth it."

Dorian wrapped his arm around my waist and walked me out the front door and he asked, "Where to?"

"A fire room would be best."  I said trying to hide the fear in my voice.  My demon's lurked behind those orange doors in the AU building.  I always found it amazing that my favorite color to this day is the color those doors are painted.  Maybe it's my mind's way of saying you can't scare me.  But they were very unsettling.

Dorian's arm remained around my waist the entire way through the lobby and to the elevator - he only removed it so we could pass through the doors.  He had been very hands off before and I wondered what had changed.

The elevator dinged open and a half a dozen people filed out and we stepped inside.  Dorian's hand still on my waist.  I leaned against the wooden bar and half against him as he held me close.  I could smell the soft scent of vanilla and a touch of cinamon.  He always smelled that way to me, even when I first met him.  I whispered.  "What's changed?"

He looked at me, our faces a hair's breath apart.  I wanted to kiss him so bad as I looked into his deep blue eyes.  He whispered back, "What do you mean?"

I took his fingers in mind.  "This."

He smiled at me.  "Your candor."

"My candor?"  Being honest.. I was slightly confused.

Dorian whispered softly in my ear.  I could feel his warm breath against my neck and it sent shivers down my spine.   "You bared your soul to me.  I can do the same."  Those words made more sense to me than him telling me straight out.  Dorian Vega was always perferct.  He had perfect grades.  His clothes were always perfectly pressed.  His hair always perfectly kept.  In all things Dorian was perfect.  His image was everything.  He was tarnishing his image to bear his soul to me - to show the world that yes, I'm gay.

The elevator dinged and  people piled on the elevator with us, I started to step away once I heard the sound of the door opening but Dorian was firm in his embrace and I didn't push too hard to stay close to him.  I felt his arm tensing and I could see the patterns shifting around him.  He was nervous.  I hummed a little tune under my breath in Dorian's ear.  The song was a comfort to me when I was anxious.  I found myself humming it a lot.

We finally got to the Academy levels and got out and headed down the halls towards the training centers.  Dorian's arm slipped from my waist and he took my hand in his.  His hand was warm and I hadn't realized how cold I was.  The halls were empty save for a few students who were late to class.  Dorian asked softly, "What was that you hummed?"

"A dragon's lullaby my Nanny use to sing to me.  I've forgotten the words and never knew the name, but it's always been a comfort to me."

Dorian smiled.  "It was nice."  We arrived at one of the first available fire starter room and the orange painted door was closed but said it was vacant.  I stared at the color that I could tolerate except for painted on a flat metal door.  Dorian opened the door and I was frozen.  It had been years since I'd stepped foot in one of these rooms.

"Everything alright?"

Dorian had let go of me and was standing in side the room of my nightmares.  I probably had used this room, or maybe not.  They were all identical - the orange painted door, the metal encasing the room inside.  Inflamable furniture.  There was no plastic inside - just in case there was a fire.  It would heat like an oven, but the fire supression would kick in and put out the fire.  These were the safest rooms in the building in case of fire.  I hated them.

But they were the safest place to through fireballs when you wanted to vent.

Dorian asked again.  "You okay?"  He didn't seem upset about repeating himself -  more concerned than anything.

"Yeah.  Just brings back memories."

Dorian stepped behind me and closed the door and picked up his phone and made a call.  I didn't pay attention as I stared at the far wall. A wall I saw every night in my nightmares.  It wasn't always this prestine and shiny.  It ususally wasn't.  But this was a room filled with nothing but terror.  I could feel it oozing off of me.

Dorian stepped up next to me.  "The camera and mics are off.  What's wrong Nox?"

I blinked at him like I didn't understand what he said.  Maybe I didn't really.  I couldn't phathom why he'd do that.  "Bad memories."

"Tell me about them."

I shook my head.  "I'd rather not.  My demon's lurk behind orange doors."

Dorian nodded and sat down on the floor crossleged and he patted the spot in front of him.  I looked at him before it dawned on me he was trying to ease my fears and push me into the reason we were here, to teach him to throw fireballs.

I took a deep breath and sat down in front of Dorian with my legs crossed, our knees touched and I stared across at the man I'd had a major crush on when I was much younger.  Now it felt like so much more than a crush - so much more consuming.

I held out my hands and wove a pattern of fire in a neat ball above my hand.  I could feel the heat, but it didn't burn me.  Dorian glanced at the ball of fire.  I intoned my instructions.  "Think of the color red and draw a line from yourself to the ball."

Dorian closed his eyes and I watched him even though I couldn't follow what his eyes told me, but I didn't need to.  There was a clear visible red line drawn from Dorian to the glowing red orb in my hand.  "That wasn't so hard." Dorian congradulated himself.

I smiled.  "Do you want to do it with the other elements?"

"Why not."

I let the small orb go and formed a blue one in it's place - water.  It was my heardest element but I could weave it faster than most Magnus could who were strongest in water.  It said a lot about the preceived power I held.  

Dorian drew the line with ease.  We did the same with air even though he already thought he was connected.  But when he finished he opened his eyes and mouthed, wow.  He was feeling the new power flowing inside him - the realization that everything he'd been taught was wrong.  It was a powerful effect.

Dorian did the final element of earth and I stood up.  "Let's play catch."

My idea of throwing fireballs had slipped away in the moments I watched Dorian enjoying the new power.  I was more than happy to vent my anxiety in a more productive way.  I formed four orbs one for each element.  "The object is to catch the orb with the correct weave so that it doesn't disappaite."

I wove a net of air that caught the ball of air in front of me when I tossed it up to show Dorian what I meant.  "The elemental net will feed the ball so it can make the distance.  We'll start closer together, then we can move apart."

I first tossed Dorian the air orb and he caught it easily.  Air was his primary element.  And since he couldn't handle more than one at a time, I instructed, "Toss it back."  He did so and I caught the air.  "Earth next."

I tossed each element to Dorian a few times declaring which I was sending over first so he could get the appropriate weave up.  And then I started just tossing randomly at him.  He dropped quite a few of them without the appropriate warning.  But he never was discouraged.  He was doing better than anyone I had ever seen on their first day in the Academy at Magnus training.  Though we didn't do this.

Dorian's phone rang and he frowned.  "I need to take this."

I nodded and took a few steps away and formed a fireball and drowned myself in the noise of the patterns around me.  I focused on the feel of the heat from my creation and then I sent it flying towards the wall and watched it splatter in an array of sparks of oranges and yellows.  My favorite color was one of the first colors to splatter across the wall and I let the image linger in my mind as I created the next.  I focused only on the fire and the splatter.  There was nothing but me and the fireballs.

Dorian touched my arm and I jumped.  I looked at him and saw a frown etching lines into the corner of his eyes.  He spoke calmly, "There has been an emergency.  I need to go handle it.  I'd like to pick up the discussion we didn't have at some point."

I nodded and smiled.  "My schedule will always be open for you."

He laughed. "I will make sure your calendar is free.  If Dae'lin is to be beleived you are nerotic about it."

I nodded.  "Have to be."

Dorian paused for several moments I could almost see the smoke coming out of his ears as he thought about something.  He looked like he was searching my face for some answer.  I wanted to kiss him - to taste his lips.  I swallowed hard as the desire started to over come me.  He gave me a lazy smile and whispered softly, "I will see you again. Very soon, Nox."

I could only nod, my own desires leaving me breathless.  Dorian chuckled as he left.  I stood staring after him.  I don't know how long I stood there before the worst possible thing that could happen to me happened - Garrett Spencer walked into the room and locked the door behind him.## The Demon

I swallowed hard.  I lost all feeling in my body.  I was amazed I was still standing after my reaction.  But I stood frozen as I would have as a five year old child I had been so long ago when I'd seen the man last.  I had done everything possible in every trip and every year in the Academy to avoid this man and he was intruding on my safe moment.  My heart started to race.  I could feel my palms sweating in my clenched fists.  

He smiled that slimey smile that everyone else thought was endearing.  I knew exactly what it meant.  He had me cornered.  I had no place to go.  I was his.

He took a few steps towards me and I stepped backwards not wanting to be any closer to him than I had to be.  His steps out paced mine and he was on top of me as my back hit the wall I had been throwing fireballs at.  I could still feel a slight warm in them.  Tenticales rose up over Garrett - air.  The cameras were off, not that they would catch the patterns he weilded.  My eyes went wide in fear.  My mouth went dry and I bit back the fear that was about to come out of my mouth.  

Garrett only smiled at me.  He stood waving the air tentacles behind him.  I could feel my knees starting to shake.  I was five all over again.

Garrett spoke in that quiet voice that scared me even more than what he was about to do to me.  "Turn around, my boy."

I shook my head.  But it was all I could do to not turn around at his command.  He waved his hand and one of the tentacles lashed out against my cheek and I could feel the knitting process begin.  "I am in control Nox.  Remember that."

He moved his index finger in a circle repeating his insturctions non-verbablly.  My body moved out of fear.  The will to survived overpowered the logical reason in my head.  Garrett laughed.  "Very good."

He reached around from behind me and started to unbutton my shirt.  "We don't want to ruin this fine peice of clothing."  It wasn't the first time Garrett had undressed me for similar reasons.  I vowed to myself it would be the last.

I felt his familiar touch down the length of my spine and I wanted to cringe and cower on the floor but I didn't move.  "Ah.  The memories."

Garrett had only physically hit me a few times in the course of the year we'd been together.  Today he choose to renew his interest in my flesh anew.  He brought down his open hand against the tender scars from early this morning.  The smack of flesh on flesh made we want to yowl in pain.  It wasn't the pain of the blow but the pain of the mind.  The fear welling up inside of me.  I was terrified.  But I did nothing to stop him.  I fell to my knees to remove myself from his hands but that had been a mistake as he rained down a series of blows from the air tentacles.  I bit my lip to keep from making any sounds.  I could taste blood in my mouth as I'd bitten through my lip.  

I waited with my eyes clamped shut for more blows to follow but nothing came.  I opened my eyes and turned to see if he was there.  I tried moving so he wouldn't see me but he wasn't there.  I stood up and grabbed my shirt and pulled it on.  I didn't have it buttoned yet as I left the room and ran into Dorian again.  He must have just missed Garrett.  I looked up and down the hall and didn't see him.  Had it been a figment of my imagination.  Was Garrett haunting my waking dreams?  Fuck!  I was so confused.

Dorian ran his finger down the healing mark on my cheek.  And glanced down at my exposed chest.  He didn't say anything.  "Did I miss something?"

I started to shake my head but I thought better of it.  "Yes."  It came out barely a whisper.  Dorian turned me towards the orange doored room and I froze.  "I don't want to go back in there."  Even I could hear the fear in my voice.

Dorian took me by the hand and lead me away.  "That's alright.  Come on."  

I followed numbly wherever he was taking me.  I didn't even follow the turns and stairs we took.  But Dorian never let go of my hand, even when we passed people in the halls.  

We ended up in the adult residences.  Dorian pulled out a key and opened the door to what I assumed was his apartment.  Normally I would have noticed the decor and soft scents that welcomed me when I entered but my body was numb.  Fear was etched in my blood.  I needed to do something, but I didn't know what.  I needed to go.  

"No.  Nox you don't."  Dorian said and took my hand and sat me down in a red swiveling bar stool with a back at his kitchen bar.  "Sit."

He walked around me and frowned.  "Take your shirt off."

A smart comment was lost on my lips as I complied, the reminants of Garrett's control coursing through my veins.  I pulled the black shirt off and I could feel the fabric sticking to the healing wounds.  It should hurt I thought to myself.

Dorian touched my back tenderly and I winched under his gentle touch.  "It's healing - slowly."

I nodded.  "It always does.  Repeated trama.  Scar tissue doesn't heal as fast."

"Can you do what you did for Nicholas?"  Dorian asked.

I shook my head.  "I can't do anything right now."

Dorian turned the chair so I was facing him.  "Why not?"

I shrugged.  "I can't feel anything.  It won't be controlled."

"Okay.  Then go lie down on the bed and I'll get something to help it heal faster."  Dorian headed towards the bedroom.  When I didn't immediately follow.  "Come on Nox it's this way."  He pulled me off the bar stool and in the direction of his bedroom.  This should be something more intamate.  I was lost in my own head.  I couldn't find my way out.

"This was Garrett?"

"I didn't tell you his name."  I stopped in the hall way before reaching the bedroom door.  

Dorian looked back at me.  "I looked it up.  It's my job to know things like this."  He grabbed my hand.  "There may be no proof but I can make sure he doesn't get young impressionable minds that don't have any defense against his ability."

I followed with little resistance.  Dorian opened his door and I was surprised to find it a stark difference from the rest of his living quarters.  Where everything else was shades of gray, his bedroom was painted blue and everything else was bright and blue.  The window let in sunlight.  The rest of the house had been closed off to the sun.  I stood staring in the doorway while Dorian went to the bathroom arond the corner.  I could hear running water.  I took a step inside.  It was the first voluntary move I'd made.  I smelled more cinamon and vanilla here than anywhere else in his house.  I closed my eyes and took a slow deep breath.  

I could feel the tension leaving with each breath.  I opened my eyes and laid on my stomach across Dorian's bed and I could smell Dorian all over the covering.  I buried my face in the blue comfortor.

I felt Dorian sit down on the soft bed.  I winced when he touched my back.  "Garrett did this?"

I didn't really know.  I was doubting my sanity.  "I don't know."  It came out muffled and I had to turn my head to the side and I repeated myself.  "I don't know.  I don't know if he did it, or if he invaded my day dreams."  He's never done that before.

Dorian nodded as he tenderly cared for the lashes across my back.  Whatever he was putting on it stung and I could feel the increased crawling of my skin stiching itselft back together.  I watched the man's expression change as he applied the green looking salve to my back.  Dorian asked, "You were day dreaming?  About what?"

I could hear the hope in his voice and I looked over at him and he met my eyes.  "Honestly.  You.  I was watching you walk away and thinking about ... things".

Dorian chuckled, "Things?"

"Do you really want me to spell it out, Dorian?"  I sat up and turned towards him.  His body was as close as humanly possibly to me without being in my lap.  

Dorian felt uncomfortable or that's the impression I got from the way he swallowed.  I asked.  "Do you want to know what I was thinking about, really Dorian?"

He nodded.  I leaned in close and I could smell his perfect scent, the cinamon and vanilla were over top his scent but not.  I could get lost in it.  I whispered.  "I was thinking about how much I wanted to kiss you.  How much I wanted to see you naked.  To touch your skin and feel your body against mine."

Dorian's breathing had increased and I could feel his warm breath against my neck.  Dorian whispered.  "I need to finish your back."  His voice sounded breathless and he didn't really want to.  But I pulled back and saw the lust in his eyes.  He was fightin the temptation.  I laid down on my stomach and let Dorian finish what he had started.  His hands were delicate against my skin.  I focused on each touch.  My breath quickedn with each one.  It wasn't the intamacy I had been dreaming about since meeting him, but it was better - because it was free will and not about sex.

My back hurt less and the crawling had stopped. Dorian was wiping the excess salve from my back with a damp towel.  When he was finished I felt the bed move and Dorian's weight removed from the bed. I looked back at him and saw him unbuttoning his shirt.  I turned around and sat up and watched him remove the button up shirt.  As each button unfolded I saw the beginnings of a dark tattoo across his chest.  

He wasn't built like Jace or most other Venatori that I'd seen naked.  I hadn't really been with a scholarly type before.  He had defined muscles everywhere but they were softer.  The tattooo covered his chest and when he removed the shirt completely I saw it covered his arm from shoulder to just above his wrist.  Dorian's hand fled to his waist and I grabbed them and shook my head.  "No."  I pulled him close to me between my legs and kissed his chest.  "This is enough."  I licked and nibbled at his chest then looked up at him.  "Is that okay?"

He nodded and pushed me backwards I crawled up higher on the bed and Dorian followed.  His hot breathe against my skin.  I pulled him to my lips and felt his soft lips against mine.  He bit my lip softly and a moan escaped before I could stop it.  Dorian's mouth trailed along my chin and down to my ear and my throat.  He used the perfect amount of tongue and teeth and I was putty in his hands.  His hands were soft and gentle acrossed my body and I was in heaven touching the taunt soft skin of his back.  

Dorian sat up abruptly and took my hands that had fallen to his thighs as he sat on my hips staring down at me.  There was something primal in his eyes and it stirred things deep down inside.  Dorian drew my hands above my head starting from my sides his hand caressing my skin.  He pinned my hands there with both of his.  His body on top of me.  He kissed me deeply and I knew Dorian wanted to play rough.  My mind started to panic.  I wasn't ready for that so soon after Garrett.

Dorian pulled back slightly and I managed to stutter out.  "Yel..St..stop."

Dorian sat up and let me go.  I let my hands hang limp where he'd left them.  "I'm sorry."

Dorian got up and I followed him.  "Dorian...Stop."

He did and I pressed my body against his back wrapping my arms around his waist.  "Just not today."  

He turned around in my arms.  He looked at me but didn't say anything.  "I only have two rules." I leaned in and kissed him softly on the lips.  I pulled away enough to speak, his forehead against mine.  "No hitting."  

Dorian nodded. "And two?"

"We use safe words."  He nodded.  "Yellow means slow down, you are too close to my limits.  And Red means stop right now."

He chuckled.  "You've read Fifty Shades of Grey."

I nodded.  "Yes.  But they've been around for years before that.  It is what I was taught to use."

Dorian pulled away, "Taught?"

I sat down on the bed.  "Yes.  For when things get rough and out of my control."

Dorian sighed and walked into the bathroom.  I wanted to follow him, but I stayed where I was.  I could hear the water running and hear Dorian muttering to himself but I couldn't make out the words.  The water turned off and Dorian stepped out with a blue towel drying off his hands.  He stood in the doorway and asked softly, "Do things generally get out of your control?"

"Depends on the person.  Usually.  By the time we've started what we just did I have already stated my rules and they theirs.  A negotiation of sorts."

"All before you have sex?"

I nodded.  "Yes.  There are a lot of things you don't know about me Dorian."

"I'm beginning to see that.  So this wasn't your normal routine.  Why?"  He asked.

I looked down at my lap and bit my bottom lip.  Dorian stepped closer and knelt down at my knees and titled my chin.  "Why?"  He asked again softly.

"I already told you why."  I sighed and fell back against the bed.  "I wasn't planning on this.  Wasn't ready.  I want more Dorian.  Not just sex.  If I wanted just sex I would have already made that move."  I sat up.  "You are fucking goregoeous.  I've wanted you since I was 15 years old.  And if it had been about sex I would have taken you out, persuaded you to let me come home with you.  We'd have walked back to your bedroom and I would have whispered the rules in your ear as I started kissing on your neck and taking off your clothes.  It wouldn't have gone down like this."

He nodded and asked another question.  "So what happened there?"

He pointed up on the bed.  "You pinned me down.  I could see what you wanted.  I panicked.  Garrett had just had his hooks in me.  I would freak out that close to his abuse.  I trust you not to hurt me Dorian, but the pain of Garrett's work was still fresh on my back."

He stood up and started pacing.  "What did I want?"  He sounded aggravated and embarrassed all at the same time.

"You wanted it rougher than I could handle in that very moment."  I stood up and stopped directly in front of him which made him stop and look up at me.  "I'm okay with that, with rough.  I'm okay with it.  But not today.  My anxiety right now is through the roof.  The conference, the new case, you and then he shows up and I could do nothing to stop him. I hadn't intended for you and I to be this intamite yet.  It scares the fucking hell out of me Dorian. I've never done this.  Never wanted it this much.  Wanted something more, to spend time with someone so much.  I've never held back my desire before Dorian.  This is all so new to me."

Dorian stood with his body pressed against mine where he had stopped.  "I sometimes forget that the rumor about you are usually true.  All the sexual partners, all the cocky attitude and all the risk.  No one ever said you were completely honest."

"Not completely.  No one knows about what Garrett did to me except you."

"You trust me that much from just this one day?"

I shrugged.  "It could be a fantasy world I base it on but yes, Dorian.  I trust you whole heartedly.  I trust you with my demons.  I trust you with my body.  But more importantly, I'm trusting you with my heart.  I will bear my soul to you if you'll let me.  I will give you everything of me. I don't know why but you make me feel safe.  Being with you makes me feel safe. I'm never safe, Dorian."

Dorian kissed me softly and it turned into a passionate kiss that left us both breathless by the end of it.  His hands cuped my face and I grinned at him.  "I'm sorry for all the shit I'm going to put you through.  I'm a mess Dorian.  But I can be yours completely if you let me."

Dorian smiled.  "We need to slow down."  I could feel my heart shattering as he spoke that simple phrase.  "We need to figure out what this all means.  You've given me a lot to think about. Nox.  We need to go slow or we will both bolt."  He kissed me softly.  "I will try with you.  Something that will be hard for me.  Something I don't do.  This type of relationship.  The closest that comes to it is the long term relationship I had with my own best friend.  But that wasn't about more than mutal gratifaction."

I blinked at him.  He'd turned my fear into hope as he continued.  I nodded.  "I should get to work."

Dorian laughed.  It felt good to hear him laugh.  To see him happy.  "You aren't leaving my side until I'm sure you are alright."

I sighed.  "I'm fine.  This isn't the first time it's happened."

"This is the first time it's happened with you awake.  So you will stay with me.  Besides I have a favor to ask of you."

"A favor?"  I winked at Dorian.

He rolled his eyes.  "And we are back to the innuendo and flirting."

I grinned at him.  "Anything for you Dorian."

"I have a 16 year old firestarter who was found on he streets of Chicago who has been presenting his mentors many problems.  I was hoping you'd talk to him be his mentor."  He smiled.  "It's why I was coming back to see if you were still in the room where I left you."

"Okay."  I said.

Dorian handed me a clean black dress shirt.  "Your's is a bloody sticky mess.  I'll have it laundered and left in your room in the morning."

We both got dressed and freshened up.  My make up was smeared beyond recovery.  I was in the process of washing it off when Dorian handed me an eyeliner pencil.  He commented, "Nostaligia."

I grinned at him.  "Thank you."

Cleaned and fresh we left Dorian's apartment to go talk to this troubled boy.## A Fellow Firestarter

I was still running my fingers through my hair straigtening it out.  Dorian was watching me.  I asked him, "What?"

He grinned at me.  "I thought I was vain."

I stuck my tongue out at him.  "It's in my face.  It's annoying."

Dorian stopped and turned me towards him and ran his fingers through my hair and it decided to stay put.  "That will teach you to keep the top so long."

He started walking and I fell in step.  "Does my hair bother you?"  I asked in not quite so seriousness.  I didn't really care if it did.

"Not at all.  I already told you I liked it. Colored tips and everything."

I was serious this time.  "Does anything bother you about my apperance?  Upset your image too far?  I can tone it down."

Dorian sighed.  "You go from flippant to serious in two seconds flat, don't you?"

I grinned at him, "Usually, there is no serious."

"Ah."  Dorian continued.  "No.  You have always had a bold statement.  Always more flamboyant that I am.  But you've grown up.  I expect your repretoire of t-shirts has only gotten worse, but you aren't loud and obnoxious.  You've come into being a normal person."

I laughed. "I've been out in the real world where my ecentricies were barely noticed so why bother."

We stopped in front the doors to one of the training rooms.  Dorian opened the door and let me step in first.  There was no flirting to his movments, his hand stayed by his side and I missed that warm contact, but this was business and I could play my part.  I knew I could.

A boy sat slung over the arm the chairs like he was some pin up cat and worth more than the paper he was printed on.  I was not impressed.  He reminded me of me...  I guess I had grown up a little anyway.

His dark eyes never moved from his phone in his hands.  "Levi."  Dorian said as he shut the door.  "Levi."  Dorian's anger was apparent now in his voice.  And yet the lad still didn't answer.  

Dorian was starting to say his name again but I used a weave of air and fire and made his seat hot.  The boy jumped out of his seat and stared at us with a look that I was sure he wished could kill.

I smiled at him.  "I got this, Dorian."

Dorian nodded. "Okay.  I'll be watching."

I knew he would.  It was a testing room, on the other side of the mirror on the far wall was a room for observers to watch a given test.  Usually for authenticity but sometimes it was used to show off a certain person's skills.  I had sat in this room many times for that express purpose.

"My name is Nox.  You are Levi.  I would appreciate it if you sat down in the now cool seat and talk with me.  I'd hate to have to make it very uncomfortable in here."  I let a flow of fire encase us along the walls.  His eyes opened wide and he sat down quickly.  I smiled at him.  "Good."

The fire winked out as I took a seat opposite of Levi.  "Tell me about yourself."

He just looked at me.  "Alright.  Dorian can you get me his file?"

"While we wait for that, I'll tell you my story."

Levi rolled his eyes at me.  "As if I care."

I shrugged. "Don't care if you do.  You will listen."

Again his eyes rolled and I wanted to slap him.  But I smiled at him.  "Again my name is Nox.  I was born to my human mother."  

The look on his face was close to a sneer.  He stood up.  "I don't want a fucking half human shit for a mentor."

I laughed.  "You won't get better than me."  At that moment I wove a fierce storm of air, water, fire and earth.  Every single thread around me was visible to the naked eye - even a human couldn't miss the swirling patterns around me.  It was a chaotic symphony of power.  It did nothing but showcase what I was.  It was an impressive scene but it was a useless lesson to be taught.  "I am also a natural born Cesari."

The look on his face said he didn't know what that was.  "I can bend all four elements at the same time."

Levi shrugged.  "So can I."  

My show ended abruptly as Dorian opened the door.  "Did I miss the show?"  He asked.

I shrugged.  "Little good it did.  Why didn't you tell me he was Cesari?"

Dorian frowned.  "Because he's yet to prove it to us.  I figured you could tell either which way."

I sighed.  "I didn't look."

Dorian nodded. "Do you want me to stay?"

"Nah, that's alright."  I smiled at Dorian.  "I got this."

His smile was brief and he headed back out the door.

Levi was still sitting in the chair, but more like a proper person than a sloth.  "You like him, don't you?"

"Very perceptive of you."

He shrugged.  "I just see things."

I asked, "What do you see?"

Levi shrugged again.  "It's hard to explain."

"Try me."

"I see connections.  Like strings attached to people."

I was fascinated.  "So each string represents a relationship?  Does the thickness tell you anything?  Or the length?"

Levi shrugged.  

"Tell me what you saw between Dorian and I?  and say Dorian and you?"

"I can't see my own connections."

"That's understandable.  I can't see my own aura either."

Levi sat forward, "You see auras?  What's that?"

"I see the pattern around people.  I know you are Cesari, level 4, natural born.  But I don't see aura's like a human might.  They aren't colors that mean something.  I see a persons gift with the elements."

"So you can see what a person is before they even know?"  He asked.

I nodded.  "I can.  I can teach someone to do it, but it's harder the older they get."

"Can I teach you what I see?"

"No.  Not likely.  My ability isn't the seeing the auras of people it's the ability to figure out patterns.  It see the complicated and make it simple.  To find the answer quickly.  Just knowing what the pattern does without having to experiment."

"Oh."  He seemed deflated.

"But I can help you read your own talent.  If you tell me what you see.  Between me and Dorian - Mr. Vega."

"It was a light pink which I've figure out usually means a new love.  Your end looked thicker and his thinner."

"Any idea what that might mean?"  I knew, I grinned.

"How much love you feel for the other person?"  I nodded.  "So you have great feelings for him and he only a little for you.  That's sad."

"Not really.  The fact that you see it at all is hope to me.  I've liked Dorian for many many years.  It stands to reason I'm father along than he is."  I asked my next question, "What do you think the color means?"

He shrugged and I continued my line of questions trying to let him figure that out.  "Seen any other colors?"

"Yeah."  Levi nodded emphatically.  "All kinds.  Reds, greens, blue and black predominatley".

"Can you peg an emotion with those colors?"  I asked.

"So you are saying that I can tell what kind of relationship it is by the color?"

I nodded.  "That's the working theory of others who have that particular skill.  There is always room for improvement and understanding."

I changed the topic.  "Do you actively use all four elements?"

"I don't know."  Levi shrugged and looked at the wall mirror.  "I just do it."

"I know the feeling."  I leaned back in my chair.  "I revealed myself as Cesari when I was 10 when I made that statue down in the lobby.  I didn't think anything of it.  I was rushing the project so I did it all at the same time not individually like I had been taught.  I had wanted to get back to the rest of that day."

"What day was that?"  Levi asked.

"It was the annual war games and art show.  Every student is tasked with creating either a peice of art or recreating an implement of war in it's full glory, or how we envisioned it.  Left to my own devices I would have done a catapult or trebuchet but my mentor, Dae'lin, insisted that year I do an art project.  She said, and I quote, 'you are more than a killing machine as a hunter, you will act like it.'"

The irony of it really.  Thinking back on it now that statement could very well be the downfall of my career at least my mark on hunter society. The Venatori court system hate hearing my name.

"Have you used all four elements?"  I asked again.  "Can you show me something - anything?"

Levi nodded and wove a complex pattern and I watched carefully as he made tiny changes that were not exactly correct, but something about the pattern nagged at me.  When the pattern was complete it was the shape of a box, but it didn't do anything just sat there. I asked.  "What does it do?"

Levi shrugged.  "Dunno."

Something was oddly familiar with the box.  "Make it go away now."

Levi said very matter of factly. "I don't know how."

"Alright.  I'll do it then.  Won't be as easy to unravel since I didn't make it."

"Wait, you can unravel a creation?  Could I unravel your peice of art down stairs?"

I shook my head.  "No, once an object takes solid form it can't be unraveled, it beocomes real, not just magic.  This is not an object persay.  It still looks like patterns, not like a rock or sand or even water, it's just threads of light, those who can bend all four elements can see.  And because of the intracacy and delicate threads I doubt anyone could see it if they were just seeing one thread of it."

Levi nodded.

I stood up and looked directly at the mirror.  "Dorian, I'm gonna go take Levi to see Jace's class. You want to come?"

I knew the answer would be yes, but I didn't wait for one.  "Come on Levi.  I want you to meet a friend and maybe we'll sit in on his beginner class."

"I'm not a beginner."

"You are if you can't dismantle your own creation.  But I don't beleive you are a beginner.  But it's never to late to see how the younger kids are taught.  You might pick up a few tricks."

I opened the door and let Levi go first.  I followed him out and was greated with a smile from Dorian.  "You think I'm going to let you go alone?"

I grinned at him.  "Didn't dream of it."

Levi groaned.  I asked him, "What?  Making you uncomfortable."

He shook his head. "No.  Whatever cranks your chain.  You two are sappy."

I laughed.  "I have never in my life been called sappy before."

Dorian only shook his head as we walked to the elevator.  I took a deep breath as we stood waiting.  I would not lean on Dorian.  I would not show weakness to a troubled child who would and could use it against me.

Dorian watched me from the corner of his eyes.  I felt that tug to go to him and ease my fears.







## The Jump

The doors opened going up and we waited for everyone to file off.  A smoker had just exited and I could smell nothing but tabacco smoke inside the elevator.  I held my breath.  Two triggers was not going to undo me.

Levi stood in front of us.  I leaned against the wooden rail and stared at my reflection in the door.  I noticed Dorian was watching me through the reflection but I couldn't hold my breath any longer.  I let it out slowly and inhaled shallow breaths trying to avoide the cigarette smoke smell, but it didn't help.  My heart was racing.  My hands were sweaty and I knew I was pale.  Fear raced through my veins turning my body stone cold.  I didn't know if I could move when we stopped.  Dorian leaned in and whispered, "What's wrong?"

I held up two fingers and knew that Dorian didn't understand what I meant, he couldn't.  Levi asked.  "What's wrong with him?"  He didn't sound amused by it actually concerned.

"He doesn't like elevators."  Dorian added, "But this isn't his usual reaction.  Something else is wrong."

The door chimed opened and we got out on the classroom level of the Academy.  My legs were stiff with fear and it hurt to move but I did move.  Dorian never touched me, though I could see the strain as he did.  I took a deep breath of clean fresh air of the Academy.  It still smelled like I remembered - like old musty books.

Levi asked, "You okay?"

I nodded.  "I'll be fine."  I hated that he saw that but it wasn't my fault.  

Dorian walked beside me while Levi followed.

"What happened Nox?"

I shook my head.  "I'll tell you later."  Dorian seemed to except that for now.  I could see the question pending in his head and his photographic memory.  

Jace's classroom was up on the right past an orange fire starter door.  I passed it without looking at it.  I triggered a minor fear but I pushed it aside.  I wasn't going to let my fears rule me anymore today.  That seemed to be all it was doing.

I opened the door to Jace's class room after a quick rap at the wooden door.  All eyes turned to us and Jace looked up from the book he'd been reading from and smiled brightly at me.  "Nox.  Everyone this is my best friend and inspiration, Nox."  He was surprised when Dorian and Levi followed me in. "And it seems Mr. Vega and a guest have come with him.  What ever do we owe for this visit?"

"They are with me."  Jace relaxed visibly.  "You aren't in trouble.  Levi here is a bit green around the edges I thought a couple of sessions here might help.  You invited me remember."

"And Mr. Vega's prsenses isn't an evaluation?"  Jace asked.  It seemed more curiousity than fear that spurred it.

Dorian shook his head.  "I'm not here for an evaluation.  Well, not yours anyway."

Jace laughed.  "You are evaluating Nox?  Come one he won't teach.  He's a hunter.  Born breed and taught to be nothing else."

I reminded Jace.  "So were you.  Look at you now."

Jace shook his head.  "I wasn't born to be a hunter.  Your mother and your father were both excellent hunters even though she was only human.  She brought down just as many baddies as your father in her tenure."

I rolled my eyes.  I hated to be reminded that her record was better than mine.  Kills counted better than a capture.  Most Venatori didn't capture they just took out their marks.  "Good for them."

Jace frowned and looked down and when he looked back up he was smiling.  "Come on.  I know what will help everyone."  Jace looked across the room.  "You feel like jumping?"

Did I ever.  Jace was right, that would help.  Beating my fears back with a stick only worked so far, conquering them on the other hand was a whole knew feeling and I hadn't done it in a very long while.  I grinned at Jace and he laughed.  "I thought so."

"Alright, everyone grab your jackets we are going to the roof."

Dorian looked at me with concern.  I put my hand on his shoulder.  "It'll be glorious.  Trust me.  I will feel better."

Dorian's look didn't change as we lead the class up to the roof.  Levi seemed to be missing.  Fuck!  I looked around and couldn't see him.  Where did he go?

Dorian looked behind me to see what was wrong.  "Damn it.  This is one of the things his mentors get pissed at."

I shrugged.  "What harm can he do?  He's not a child.  We'll find him later.  I need to do this."

Dorian nodded. "Are you sure?  It sounds dangerous."

"I laugh in the face of danger." I laughed in a fake villianouse voice.  It made Dorian smile.  The kids closes to us giggled.

We took the elevator to the top floor.  I didn't hesitate to stand against Dorian and taken in his comforting scent as we rode up to the top floors.  Jace elbowed me in the back and whispered, "Way to go."

Dorian chuckled in my ear then asked, "You do know we've a history right?"

I nodded and whispered back, "Yes. His last fling before getting back with Mia forever.  I couldn't forget that."

Jace asked.  "Does it upset you?"

I shook my head.  "I never had a problem sharing with you Jace.  Though now..." I turned to look at Jace with a grin. "Mine."

Jace laughed as the door dinged open and the children filed out and started for the stairs to the roof.

Dorian and were the last ones out and he stopped me with a hand on my wrist. "You really aren't worried or upset?"

I shook my head.  "No.  It's not news to me.  I was miffed at the time he told me.  But I'm okay with it."

Dorian asked, "Mine?"

I smiled.  "It was something we did when we were younger and were aiming to nail the same person."

"Alwyas so crude?"

"Sorry.  I'll try to pharse it more delicately next time, but it wasn't about the sentimental stuff - not ever."

Dorian asked, "And now?"

I kissed Dorian descretely on the lips, I didnt linger.  I whispered as I pulled away, "Whatever you want, you get."

Jace called down from the stair well, "You two coming?"

I looked to Dorian.  "We can finish this later.  I know you won't forget.  That's four things we need to talk about."

Dorian said.  "Five."

"Five?  What am I missing?"

"You aren't.  But I have something else to ask you later."

I nodded.  "Anything.  And I will be completely honest."  

"I know."

I went up the stairs two at a time, Dorian not so fast.  Once we reached the top the wind was blowing softly and the kids were all wrapping their arms around them.  It felt refreshing.

Dorian stood back by the door.  I stepped carefully towards to edge.  The last time I imagine Dorian was up here was the day I saved him when he fell.  I looked back at him and he was leaning against the wall near the door watching me with those deep blue eyes.  I smiled back at him and he returned it, though it never reached his eyes.  He didn't want to be up here.  

I took Jace aside.  "Tell Dorian to meet me downstairs while I prepare.  I won't be back up after I jump.  Levi took off I need to find him."

Jace nodded and went to do as I asked.  The children chattered behind me.  Jace yelled.  "Make it a spectical."

I had already planned on it.  I took a deep breath about 10 steps away from the ledge I was about to jump off.  I put up a veil around the entire AU building and I heard Jace whistle.  "Damn, you've been practicing."

I shrugged.  "I always held back before."  I held the viel in place and a caphony of weaves circled the entire enclosure.  Reds and blues danced with yellows and brown.  It was the same chaotic symphomy of patterns that I'd used on Levi earlier.  I looked back and I saw Dorian standing in the doorway watching in stunned awe.  When he looked at me I grinned at him and looked forward and ran those ten steps and dove over the edge.  I could hear the wail of the children but it was soon drowned out by the wind whipping past my ears.  

Wings of air formed around me and I sent softening patterns to the ground below.  It always reminded me of the scene in the matrix when Neo bounced off the pavement.  It wasn't really a bounce for me, but it's how I envisioned it when I first created it.  It was an 8 second drop to the ground and it was pure bliss.  

There was nothing but me and the world around me.  Nothing but conquered fears and my ego gloating over defining my innate senses.  

I landed on the soft green grass and I rolled over and held my thumbs up.  I couldn't see Jace leaning over the edge, but I knew he was.  I could look but I didn't have to extend my vision.  I just knew.

I lay on the grass staring up at the swirling syphony and I started to hear a mass of people chattering.  I looked behind me while still laying on the ground.  The world was upside down, but there were Magnus and other Venatori standing on the pavement watching me.  I grined and I let the veil fall and with it the symphony died and exploded into tiny particles that floated to the ground and disappeared.  Specitcal it was.

I heard the alley door open and I saw Dorian standing there holding the door.  I got up and turned towards the lingering crowd and gave a flourishing bow.  I couldn't make out what anyone inparticular was saying but I heard a few girls giggling.  I headed for the door and the caphony of voices rose.  Dorian held the door for me and we stepped back inside the quiet of the empty stairwell.

Dorian grabbed my wrists and pushed me up against the wall and kissed me with passion, so much passion it almost hurt.## Always the Same

Dorian's lips pressed against mine.  I could feel his body pressed against me.  His teeth grazed my lips and our tongues entwined.  Time fled me as I was embraced in the warmth and comfort of that kiss unable to do anything else not that I wanted to anyway.  Dorian pulled away and pressed his forehead against mine and I stared into his deep blue eyes - my heart racing for all the right reasons for a change.  Dorian whispered, "I wanted to do that then."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Why didn't you?  I would have been receptive."

Dorian kissed me tenderly, "You know why."

I laughed.  His friends had dragged him away before we could do more than look at each other.  I was flying from the jump and from the kiss.  "I'm hungry again."

Dorian shook his head.  "This time I think we can work."

I nodded, "If you insist."

Dorian kissed me one last time, bitting my bottom lip as he pulled away.  I let slip a soft moan and he chuckled at me.  "You are easy to tease."

"You are good at it."  I stepped away from the wall and Dorian joined me as we started up the stairs.  We walked the entire way to the common area.  Dorian was winded - I was to a degree, but I was used to hiking in the thin air of the Rocky Mountains for days on end, this was nothing.  

"We didn't have to walk the whole way."

Dorian smiled.  "I know.  I have to keep up somehow."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Oh really?  I can think of a few activities that could increatese your endurance."

Dorian turned that great shade of rose as we opened the landing door and stepped into the hallway and started for the cafeteria.  Dorian took my hand in his and I looked at him with surprise.  He was growing more braizen by the minute.  I was loving it.  I didn't like to hide who I was, and Dorian was fitting into my image and falling so far out of his.  I stopped and Dorian had to drop my hand or he'd have yanked both our arms.  "What's wrong?" he asked.

"Are you doing this for me?  Or because you want to?"

Dorian frowned, "Doing what?"

"Being open about this.  Holding my hand.  Your arm around me.  Even kissing me where people could see.  Is it because you think I want it?"

"No."  Dorian smiled at me.  "Am I doing it because it's you - yes.  But not because I think it's what you want."  He closed the distance and his blue eyes sparkled as I looked into them.  "I do this because I want to.  You don't care what others think.  Let's just say I'm trying to be more like you.  Fuck the image."  Dorian laughed and ran his fingers through my hair.  "I can't pull off what you do, but I can be open about who I am.  I'm trying.  Not because you want me to - because I want to.  I'm a grown man, I don't play childish games."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Good.  I don't want you to change for me.  I like you just the way you are - warts and all."

We laughed and Dorian leaned in and kissed me tenderly.  I could hear people talking about us and hoped Dorian didn't but the tension in his hands told me otherwise.  I bit his bottom lip gently and he pulled away staring at me.  "What was that for?"

"To bring you back to me and not listen to them."  I whispered.

"Thank you." Dorian wrapped his arm around my waist and we walked into the cafeteria with a gaggle of teenage girls giggling behind us.   Things never changed around here.  Dorian glanced back at the girls and they squealed a little before scampering off like the rugrats that they were.

The line in the cafetria was long.  It was later than I thought it was.  We'd spent a great deal of time togeth today - Dorian and I.  I don't think I'd ever done that with anyone other than Jace.

The girls that had been following us were standing in line just in front of us.  They giggled when they saw us standing behind them.  I did not miss teenage girls.  One of the girls couldn't stop staring at me.  I ran my fingers through my hair and grinned at her.  I asked her, "Yes?"

She blushed and looked away but her gaze quickly returned.  She took a step towards us.  "You are the one that just jumped, aren't you?"

I nodded.  "I am.  Why?"

"The whole class thought we were under attack."

"Attack with a light show?"  I snickered.  "I take it they aren't very bright."

She giggled and offered me her hand.  "Daniella Rivera."

I took her hand and lifted it to my lips with a kiss.  "Nox.  I know your aunt."

She nodded. "I know.  She use to complain about you when I was little. He's such a terror.  Why can't he behave.  Why doesn't he act more like X, Y or Z.  On and on."

"Yep that sounds like Dae'lin.  And I remember you though you weren't nothing but an ankle biter then."

Daniella looked at Dorian and then back at me with a flip of her hair to emphasize how long her neck was, she leaned forward and whispered.  "I granduate this year."

I chuckled.  "Congradulations." A small frown played on her lips that were stained a light purple like the skimpy little dress she wore.  Dae'lin would kill her if she saw her in that thing.  

I leaned into Dorian and wrapped my arm around him pulling him close to me.  He hurmphed at the jarring but settled in against me staring off into the crowded cafeteria.  The pout on Daniella's face turned real.  "You really are gay?"


I laughed.  "No.  I'd like you too if you weren't Dae'lin's neice."

Another girl turned around with a fake smile on her face.  "What about me then?"

"Yeah.  Sorry, Duckling.  I've got my hands full right now."  Dorian turned his attention to the two girls and then back at me with a wicked grin on his lips.  I wondered what that was all about.  Dorian dropped his arms from around me and took a step back and leaned against the wall.  He was throwing me to the baby wolves.  "Thanks love."

Dorian stared at me a little stunned at my word choice.  It was sarcasm but I was fairly sure I meant what it implied.

The Daniella's friend moved closer to me.  I looked back to Dorian as she tried to invade my space.  I took a step back.  "Alright.  I know what you've heard.  But Duckling I have a few rules in all those rumors you know about me.  And the first one is I don't ..."  I looked at Dorian and rethought my phrasing.  "I don't do anything with underage persons, I don't do anything with married ones, and I don't like having singler parents for partners on the dance floor."

Dorian was smiling happily behind his hand.  I had passed whatever little test he decided to throw at me.  The girl leaned against me again. "I can give you a better time than he can."  She sneered at Dorian.

I leaned down and whispered so Dorian and Daniella could here.  "Can you now?  You have a cock under that pretty little dress?"

I didn't need to see her hand to know she was going to hit me.  I knew the way her body tensed and I waited for the stinging hand print to make it's impression on my cheek.  I received a second on from Daniella just for good measure I was sure.  The whole gaggle of girls walked off.  I called after them.  "See ya ... ladies."  

I turned back to Dorian who was moving forward in line now that the girls had left the space clear.  "I see nothing changes."

"Sorry."

Dorian pulled me close and I could feel his warmth against my leg.  His hands tenderly ran around the marks that were blossoming red I was sure.  "Not the first time, huh?"

"That I've been slapped?"  I shook my head, "And not likely the last one either."

Dorian leaned in and whispered, "Is that really how you feel about a better time."

I grinned at Dorian.  "You'll just have to wait and see love."

"There is that word again."

"A problem?"  I asked with a calm lift to my voice.  

"No.  Something like your use of duckling?"  Dorian asked.

"Maybe.  Maybe not.  But if it bothers you I'll call you Duckling too."

Dorian laughed as we stepped inside the serving area.  I smiled the moment I got inside and saw Ms. Shiela doling out mashed potatoes and gravy on individual trays.  Her auburn hair was more gray that I remembered it but she still had that motherly look to her.  I poked Dorian with my elbow and nodded towards our server as I said.  "What's a gorgeous dame doing behind some glass partition.  You should be the one being served, not the other way around."

I watched as the fury rose in her cheeks as she was about to spout some anti-sexist remark my way until she saw me and that fury slippied away as fast as the gravy was running down her arm.  "We'll aint you a sight for sore eyes.  I 'eard you was gonna be back."  I loved her souther accent.  Jace hardly ever used his unless his family was around then it came back like riding a bike.  Ms. Sheila never lost hers.

"You waz the one making all that ruckus out there ain't ya?"

I gave her an innocent smile.  "Who me?  Nah.  It was Dorian."

She chortled and nearly dropped her tray.  "That boy ain't got your foolishness about him at all."

I grinned at her and put my arm around him.  "Well, he's got some of it if today's been anythng to say for his foolishness."  I laid a soft kiss against his cheek and he almost hit me.  I felt his arm tense underneath my hand.  I stopped the game and apologized. "Sorry."  I let go of him but he wrapped his arm around me.

"Didja just apologize to the man?"

I nodded.  "Yeah."

Ms. Sheila stepped away shaking her head and headed into the back like she always had when I stepped through her kitchen doors.  Dorian whispered in my ear.  "Don't apologize, Nox."

I turned to look at him.  "I made you uncomfortable. I was out of line."

The girl who was next to Ms. Shiela handed Dorian his tray after he'd decided what he wanted.  The line was being held up and I stepped back to wait on her to get back.  Dorian moved along.  "I'll find us a table." He said before kissing me softly.  "I'll get used to it."

I was grinning madly after Dorian, watching him walk down the rest of the line towards the checkout counter when Ms. Sheila came out carrying a tray.  "I ain't got it all like I used to.  Ya'll gonna be around for while."

I looked back towards the direction Dorian had gone and then back to her.  "That's the plan."

She laughed.  "Maybe ya got more sense then you did as a youngin."

"Doubtful."  I smiled at her with a small bow.  "Thank you ma'am for taking care of me. I don't think I've ever thanked you for that."

Ms. Shiela turned the color her hair used to be.  "Ain't nothin.  Ifin ya want ya'll are welcome to come and cook with me anytime."

I nodded.  "Yes ma'am.  I will."

I made my way to the checkout counter grabbing a bottle of water from the cooler.  I reached for my wallet where my stupid meal card was but the man at the counter smiled and said, "We have you covered for this meal Mr. Sétanta, courtesy of the conference."

"Okay.  Thanks then".  I saw Dorian sitting at a table with others on the end of it.  I took a deep breath and walked towards him.  I could deal with them if they bothered me.  And I expected they would bother me - they always did.

A rather large woman stopped me in the aisle between tables.  "That was quite some show you put on."

I grinned at her trying to remember her name.  Sometimes I wished I had a gift like Dorian and could remember everything at a glance.  But I remembered her.  She had always been larger for a Venatori - our strength and endurance meant that we had high metabolisms - I didn't but full Venatori did.  But she was half human like I was.  "Ren right?  Thanks."

She smiled brightly at being remembered.  "Maybe you can show me how you did it sometime?"

I looked over at Dorian who was watching me with a grin on his face.  Shit!  This fucking progeny thing was going to fucking kill me if I couldn't sit down and eat a meal in peace.  "Maybe.  I need to go.  My boyfriend is waiting for me."

She frowned at my use of words which made me smile inside.  She glanced back where I was looking and Dorian looked down snickering to himself as he sipped at the soda on his tray.  "Boyfriend?  I thought.."

I smiled at her and interrupted, "I do."  I pulled a card out of my wallet that was sitting on my tray.  "Make an appointment.  I'm all sorts of popular these days."  She gave me a happy smile and sat down with her friends.

I made it to Dorian without little more incendent except the people at the end of the table had gone.  So much better.  Dorian looked at me with a grin and reached across my tray and stabbed a carrot with his fork.  "Do you flirt with everyone?"

I smiled.  "I try, Duckling."

He grinned.  "Even the ugly ones?"

There was nothing on Dorian's plate I would touch I stared at it then looked back up at him.  I wished I could eat anything I wanted and look like him... fucking human genes.  I smiled at him to answer his question.  "Especially the ugly ones."

A voice over my shoulder said, "What ugly ones?  You mean you and your _boys_."  I sighed as I recognized the voice as Aaron Woolbright - my former roommate and tormentor.  And also one of the crowd who I was trying to avoid at the end of the table.  

Aaron didn't wait for my answer or my smart remark, he pushed my tray across the table as hard as he could.  The split in the middle caught it and it flew up in the air spilling contents everywhere.  I managed to catch most of it with a weave of air and place it back on the tray on the table where it had carened over.

I stood up and smiled down at the muscular black man who was nearly a foot shorter than I was.  He stared up at me with a glare I recalled from my childhood.   There were lines wrinkling his face in places that were reserved for old me and women who laid out in the sun for most of their lives.

"Hi Aaron.  So glad of you to join us."

I saw Dorian from the corner of my eye, he was pretending to mind his own business like everyone else in the cafeteria.  

Aaron placed his hands on my chest and I wove an wall of air behind me faster than he could push me backwards.  I was immovable, but I could feel his strength pushing into my rib cage. I could feel them cracking under his massive strength but he stopped as I could feel the air leaving my chest.  He always was a punk.  He always did the same thing.  He can at me with a right hook and I easily ducked underneath it with a leg swipe I assisted with a bar of air and Aaron fell flat on his back.  I had to say something.  I just had to.  "You'd think you'd have learned some different moves in these past ten years Aaron."

I held the large man down with a bar of air and my knee at his throat.  I smiled down at him.  "Do you want to try that again?  I'll give you a free shot."

He snapped his fingers and the others with him came at me.  I released my power and rush of air from my person knocking everyone back who was trying to attack me.  "Please.  You really think I'm going to let you win like I used to?  I don't have Dae'lin holding my strings anymore.  Do you want to try this again?"

I got up off Aaron and when I was several steps away I removed the bar of air.  "Come on.  Do you really want to fight me?  You are just gonna find yourself losing.  I'm sure you know that feeling well - being a loser."

Aaron rushed me like a bull.  He put his head down and I formed a wall of air between us and he rammed his harded headed brain into the air and I watched him bounce off the wall and fall on his back.  He was holding his head like it hurt.  "I can fix that if you like."  I started letting flows of all the elements extend from my fingers and he scrambled up and ran away with the rest of his flunkies.  I watched as they ran away like little cowards that they really were.  

I grabbed what was left of my tray and sat down in front of Dorian.  He looked sad.  "Is this how it always is with you?"

"You mean with Aaron?  Or just my attitude?"

Dorian smiled. "Aaron.  I'm well aware of your attitude."

"Yes.  He's always tried to bully me.  He always gets a few good licks in before I end it.  So I wouldn't get in trouble for starting it."

"He didn't get any in this time.  He wasn't very witty either."

I nodded.  "Never was."

I looked down at my tray and was disappointed that there was hardly anything on it.  I sighed and ate the single carrot and the tiny portion of chicken that had survived the flipping and didn't land on the floor before I had reacted.

"You want some of mine?" Dorian asked.

I shook my head.  "That's alright.  I'll get something later."

"Don't want to share?"  Dorin was faking a pout the big lip and everything.

I reached across and picked up his spoon and took a mouthful of the mashed potatoes and gravy.  It tasted like I'd remembered - not good.  "I'll make you some better that those."

"You cook?"  Dorian asked.

I nodded.  "Only way I can eat what I need to."

"Need to?"  Dorian grinned.  "You sound like a one of those health nuts."

"I suppose I am.  It's an OCPD thing.  Change is anxiety ridden.  I schedule just about everything.  Almost."  I smiled at him.  "It's hard to be spontaneous when you feel the need to have control over everything.  I try and I succeed somedays, but it usually means for the next few days or months I'm gonna be gung-ho about my schedule."

"I'll have to remember that."  Dorian pulled the papers from my laptop bag, helping himself to my personal possessions it seemed.  ## Incomplete Puzzles

I watched him set the laptop up and fire it up without a problem until the password screen flashed on.  He looked to me and waited for me to type it in.  I handed Dorian a card and pointed to a set of words on it.  "All lowercase no spaces."

Dorian shook his head.  "Anyone could guess that."

I grinned.  "It's my laptop not some super secret thing.  The other passwords are more cryptic."

Dorian just shook his head and typed it in.  He found what he was looking for and started a program on my computer I hadn't ever used. It was some annotation software apparently.  Dorian pecked away at the keys and used the track pad like it was a foreigh object.   I watched until I figured out what he was doing.  My stomach rumbled and he pushed his tray in front of me.  "Eat."

I groaned and he looked up from the screen and gave me that look that said I had better or else... I'd have liked to have known what that or else was that gave him that twinkle in his eye.  I ate the mashed potatoes and pulled the skin off the fried chicken and finished what was left of the canned vegetables Dorian had taken.  I tried not to gag on any of it.  I knew my stomach was going to pay for it later.

Dorian turned the computer screen more in my direction and he'd plotted out all the locations of the pattern fragments we'd seen.  They tugged at a memory but I couldn't quite remember where I'd seen them.  They weren't fitting right.

"What's wrong?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know.  They don't fit right.  I know peices are missing but they look inside out.  I don't know how to explain it."

Dorian started up another program from the Venatori servers and started pulling in the drawings I had made on the wall.  He separated each patter and let them float inside the program, it kinda looked like a puzzle to put together.  And that was exactly what it was.  

I pulled the laptop closer to me and started moving peices around.  This was my thing.  I could see what I wanted but I needed to turn peices in a way they just didn't logically move.  Dorian was watching me work and playing footsy with me under the table.  I was happily ignoring him and he was trying to distract me.  A happy game.  But Dorian saw that I'd stopped working and asked, "What's wrong?"

"I can't move the peices like I want."

Dorian took the laptop from me and started manipulating the images.  "How do you want it positioned?"

"Show me how?"  Dorian moved his hands and places his over mine and moved my fingers with a gentle touch.  It wasn't that hard, now that I knew how.  Dorian lifted his fingers and watched me.

"What are you doing?"  He asked.

"Putting together a puzzle with missing peices."  Dorian moved around to my side of the table so it was easier to do this.  His leg pressed against mine and I looked at him.  "You..."  I was lost for words.  

Dorian grinned at me.  "Me?"

I put my hand on his leg and smiled and went back to work.  Thankfully he was on my left so I could still work well with one hand.  His hand patted mine and remained there entwined with my fingers.  

I had the peices where I thought they went but they still looked wrong but I don't know how that could be.  I shook my head.  "Still wrong somehow.  I should know this."

Dorian closed the laptop lid with my fingers still resting on the keyboard.  "Let it marinate for a while. It'll come to you."

I grinned at him.  "Are you still babysitting me?"

Dorian nodded very serious like.  "Yes.  Why?"

"I need to go for a run."  Some of the color left Dorian's face and he frowned.

But he turned it quickly into a joke.  "In these shoes.  I think not."

"I'll be gone an hour or so.  I have some anxiety issues to work out so it might be a little longer."

Dorian looked down at his watch.  "Stop by my apartment when you are done."  He loooked up at me.  "Please, or in two hours I'll send the calvary after you to make sure you are alright."

I nodded. "Alright.  We've done one of the five things on our list.  We can finished the others then?"

Dorian smiled.  "I'll walk you to your destination we can talk about something pressing on my mind."

"Alright."  I started packing up my laptop bag and all the papers we had strewn about on the table.  The cafeteria was nearly empty - it was never completely empty.  The food service might be over but the coffee machines were always on and people worked al hours of the day here only self service items were available now.  I hadn't realized how late it really was.

Dorian walked with me towards the door befor he spoke in a barely audible whispere.   "Who is Adrian?"  I froze.  Dorian stopped and turned and looked at me. "When I was talking with Bonnie at the diner she mentioned him."

I could feel the blood draining from my face and my hands were ice cold.  I took a deep breath and started walking, we needed someplace quiet to talk now.  This wasn't a cooridor talk.  I found an empty room that wasn't used at the time and I showed Dorian in.  "Is something wrong?"

I put up a ward against eavesdropping.  It wasn't a topic I wanted everyone in the world to know.  I shook my head.  I tried to speak but my mouth had suddenly gone dry.  Dorian used it to ask more questions.  "You don't look like you want to talk about it.  Bonnie said that you were broken during/after your abuser until you met Adrian..."

He paused unsure of where he was going after that.  "I will tell you anything.  I just am not sure you are ready for that tidbit of information so soon into whatever we have going on."

"That bad?"  Dorian asked and sat on the corner of the desk one leg stretched on in front of him the other proped up on the table leg.  

I was trying to avoid looking Dorian in the eyes.  "Adiran is one of the few long term relationships I've had."

"So another child abuser?"

I shook my head.  "Adrian didn't abuse me no matter what you think."  I was angry at the fact that he was judging my friend - my salvation.  "If it weren't for Adrian and Margo's work togethere I'd still be that broken little boy.  I'd still be paralyzed under someone's influece unable to say no.  Unable to break the chains that were ingrained in me so young."

There was sympathy on Dorian's face.  I didn't need his pity.  I turned around.  I didn't want to see that look on his face - on anyone's face but definitely not his.  I continued.  "I went to a club, we all did.  Jace, me, Mia, and a few of her friends.  It was all about finding sex.  Not with each other.  I met a man - a werewolf actually.  He was into bondage and I had agreed.  I was underage, but that didn't seem to bother him too much.  I laid out my rules and he agreed.  We didn't know each other's name - it's the way I like it."

I paused to collect my thoughts.  "He pinned me against the wall and I froze.  The moment my shoulders touched I was the zombie like kid that Garrett had created.  It still happens now when I'm not prepared for it.  But he is a therapist, he knew exactly what was happening.  He stopped and started asking me questions.  Things like does this happen often.  Has anyone ever done anything against your will."

"I could only answer in one word sentences, but I was truthful.  I had to be in that state.  He asked me if I was getting help and when I said yes he asked for her number and he immediately called her while I stood still pressed up against the wall like he'd left me.  He explained things and he and Margo argued but I wasn't paying attention.  He told me when he hung up that he'd help me - for a fee."

"I only nodded but he released me from my holding.  He told me.  'No one should have that over your'.  He introduced himself as Adrian Lupita and we got started right away.  He taught me the safe words - taught me how to say no when I lost control due to fear.  He helped me."

I looked up expecting to see the wall and not Dorian, but there he was standing in front of me, whiping away a tear that had fallen and was sliding down my cheek.  He was gentle and careful not to make more of a mess.  He whispered, "Did you sleep with him?"

I nodded.  "A couple times.  But it wasn't like that.  And it wasn't until I had full control of my own self.  He showed me things."

"Things?"


I took a deep breath.  "How to be a dominate or a submissive depending on who I was with without giving up complete control to the other.  He showed me sex didn't have to hurt to be pleasurable."  I was looking at Dorian's deep blue eyes when I finished.  "He taught me it's okay to be weak sometimes."

Dorian stared at me.  "Nox..."  He wrapped his arms around me.  He pittied me.  He pittied my childhood.  I didn't return the warm gesture.  I wanted to but it was pity that promptd it.  I hated being pittied.

Dorian unwound his arms from me with a frown, "What's wrong?"

"You pity me."  I said it with so much venom Dorian flinched.

"It's a natural reaction to a sad upbringing.  I'm sorry you can see that.  It doesn't change anything."

"Nothing?  How could it not?  According to you I've been raped.  I've had sexual encounters you can't even imagine because it was what I thought love was.  It was how I felt close to someone without getting emotionally hurt.  How does that not affect anything?"

Dorian looked down at his feet.  "I can't imagine your life before.  Honestly Nox, it pisses me off that someone - anyone - treated you like this. Could treat anyone like this.  Someone should have been watching you - looking out for you."

"What could they do Dorian?  I had that.  I snuck out behind their back to do the things I wanted.  I was the one doing wrong because it felt good.  I fucked up my life.  Now I get to deal with it."

"It still changes nothing.  Without those experiences you wouldn't be who you are.  There is no point in worrying about the past.  Worrying whether or not you will fall back into those comforting memories.  If you do you do and we'll deal with it.  But this person right here."  He grabbed my shoulders.  "This person is a good man.  Yes I feel bad about your upbringing.  But I'm smart enough to realize that it's what shaped you.  And you yourself said that this was new.  I'm new to you.  That means you don't want what you had before you."  He pulled me close to him, his forehead pressed against mine.  "I'm okay with that."  

I blinked at him unable to say anything.  My anger and memories were fadng being this close to his calm center.  The scent of vanilla and cinamon permated the air around Dorian and I could feel muscles losen that I hadn't known were tight.  I kissed Dorian.  My breath quickened with each beat of my racing heart.  My body ached for him.  Ached for his fingers against my skin.  But Dorian pulled away first with a smile, "You were going for a run?"

I nodded.  "I should."

Dorian nodded. "I'm not sorry I asked Nox.  I'm concerned but not about your past."

"What are you worried about?"

Dorian took my arm and started walking towards the door.  "Things you don't need to worry about Nox.  It's not you that concerns me.  It's myself."

I stopped and Dorian turned to look back at me.  "Don't hide from me Dorian.  I won't lie to you, or hide from you.  I will answer anything you need to know.  Tell you everything.  I can't deal with games and new feelings.  I can't."

Dorian nodded and took a step towards me and took my arm again and we left the room before he continued.  "I'm worried I'm not enough for you.  I have no where near the experiences you do."

I laughed.  "You think any of that matters to me?"  I stopped Dorian pushed him up against the wall and pressed my body against him.  I could feel his warmth and my only thought was to want to have him naked under my hands.  I leaned in and whispered in his ear.  "No one.  And I mean no one has ever made me feel the way you make me feel.  I'm scared and excited at the same time. I think about kissing you and my knees go weak.  The thought that you might want me makes my heart soar."

Dorian asked, "Might?  There is no might in this equation Nox."

I smiled.  "You are enough Dorian.  Always enough. More than enough."

He kissed me in the hallway. It was long and passionate and I know I felt at least one person brush my back as they hurried past us.  We pulled apart breathless and smiling and started back down the path we were to the gym holding hands.  The silence wasn't awkward.  The looks we received made Dorian tense until they were behind us.  No one said anything.  No one stopped us to tell us how wrong this was.  Men with men didn't happen often in the Venatori but it did happen - ironically women with women happened more often.  But I felt happy - happier than I had ever felt in my life.
## Accidents Happen

We went the long way to the gym.  I'm not sure if Dorian was prolonging it or if he was just letting me wander, but it doesn't really matter.  I stopped at the door to the gym and stepped aside as someone was exiting.  Dorian kissed me good-bye there were no words just the soft press of his lips and his teeth biting softly into my lip before he parted with a wink.  "Remember stop by when you are done."

I nodded and watched as Dorian walked away from me to go do whatever it was he did.  I entered the gym and changed quickly and left down the stairs outside into the cool New York air.  A storm was brewing I could feel it on my skin, and the sky looked angry in the dim light of dusk.

I ran for about an hour.  It felt good to be back in New York City doing the things I did.  It was a releif to find peace in my surroundings. Not that nature wasn't peaceful, this was just home.  I was a mess more than ever though.  Around every corner I thought I saw Garrett.

I focused on the memory of Dorian, how he smelled, how he felt, his lips against mine.  By the time I was back in the gym hitting the showers my mind was preocuppied with seeing Dorian again.  So preoccupied I didn't notice the veil I didn't put up and a pair of teenage boys were staring at the scars on my back.  Soon as I turned around they bolted out the door knocking over a bucket of mops and brooms in the corner.

I sighed and turned off the water and wrapped my towel around me and headed for the locker I was using.  I sat down and started rifling through my bag of things to find something comfortable to wear I was tired of the monkey suit.  I found another pair of shorts and a semi-decent t-shirt.  It at least didn't say anything inappropriate, and it matched with the shorts, both a dark shade of red.  The shirt read "I'd hit that" with a picture of a pinanta underneath it.  

A voice spoke behind me as I mused about the shirt.  "I'd hit that?  Really?  You haven't grown up at all."

I didn't turn to see my father standing next to an opened locker pulling a t-shirt over his head.  "Nope I have not."

He sat down next to me but faced the other way and pulled on his sneakers.  "Those scars?  You want to talk about them.  They aren't career related."

"No I don't actually."

Kai put his hand on my shoulder as he stood up, there was only a little uncomfortalbe weight added to my body as he stood.  "If you do.  I'd love to hear the story.  Beat the shit that hurt you."

I stood up and pulled my shirt over my head and my boxers and shorts on before I said anything as I turned to face my father.  "You care now?"  It sounded sharp and bitter.  It was rude.  I closed my eyes and swallowed my pride.  "I'm sorry.  That was uncalled for.  You didn't know."

"I would have then and I do now.  Son, we are too alike that's why we butt heads.  You are more like me than any of my other children and it's frightening because it comes from the same upbringing.  Don't get lost in the anger."  He didn't stay any long as he headed off into the depths of the gym to hunt down whatever workout he was going to do.  

I sighed and finsihed dressing and packing up my things.  I was about to head to the stairs when I heard the fire alarm go off.  It squelched five times with a short pause then gave the location.  I headed towards the archives at least that's what I thought it said.  Why would anyone be bending in the archives?  And then I thought about it - another bomb...

I took the stairs three at a time and by the time I reached the right level i was sweating and breathing heavy from the added exersion.  There was a crowd milling around in every cooridor.  I had to talk my way through things with my back pack slung over my shoulder.  My father was already up here and he was stepping up to block my passage.  "No."

"No?"

Kai pushed me back they way I'd come.  "I said No."

"Why the fuck not? I can help." I was bristling with anger I could feel the blood rushing through my body hotter than when he'd interrupted me before.

"Nox, just no."

"Let me pass Kai." 

I tried to shove my way through when one of the medics grabbed my wrist.  "I need him."  He lead me around the corner. "Whatever you did last time, I need you to do it again."

I blinked at him and then I remembered him, he was one of those who'd watched me heal Nick.  I nodded, "Alright."  I turned to look a the broken body in front of me and I froze.  Dorian lay on the gurny in front of me, 3/4 of his body was burnt, his face, the pretty clothes were all char and I could clearly see the tattoo on his chest through it.  The medic pushed me, "Come on man, we got another one."

I blinked again and grabbed Dorian's hand.  "I got you.""  I let my powers flow through me into him.  I wove patterns of all the elements and let them settle over his whole body as I fed his body the strength he needed to heal himself.

I could see the wounds knitting closed as I did.  I could feel the weakening it was doing to my body.  "Where is the second one?  Bring them here.  I'll not be strong enough later."

The medics listened and Nox saw what was a pretty woman lying on another gurny the resemblence to Dorian was uncanny.  Fuck!  I held her hand and I fed her the same energy.  I split the pattern two ways.  I could feel my own energy levels depleting.  I could feel my legs giving way and I fell to my knees.  I heard a voice behind me, "You need to stop."  I shook my head.  No there was still too much damage.

I gave them both everything I had and darkness overcame me only moments later.

* * *

I tried to open my eyes but they still felt heavy, my whole body felt heavy.  There was a faint scent of vanilla and cinamon lingering in the air.  I rested in the comfort of the smell until I felt the weight lifting.  I tried to sit up and open my eyes at the same time, but I couldn't move.  That was when I noticed hands where pressing medown.  Voices were speaking, "Hold him down.  We have to get the needle in."

It was a gut reaction - needles were one of my biggest fears and I hadn't meant to but I expanded my presense and pushed people away with a gust of hard air.  There were no hands on me anymore.  There was buzzers going off all over and my head started to pound.

A woman, a voice I barely recognized was touching my arm.  "It's okay Nox.  Calm down.  We need you to calm down."  I sat up unhindered this time and blinked at everyone in the room.  I didn't recognize anyone.  

"What's going on?"

The same woman touching me looked up at me from her small stature and smiled.  "You passed out.  We need to give you nourishment."

"I'm awake now so you don't need to put an IV in my arm."

She nodded, "Yes we do.  Please?"

"No".  It came out much louder than I had intended.  Someone cleared their throat in the doorway and I looked up to see Dorian dressed in a hospital gown and dressings all over the place.  Fuck!  The memories flooded back.  I remember seeing Dorian burnt and dying - his mother too.

Another nurse was abruptly upon Dorian before he could say anything as we looked at each other.  "Mr. Vega, go back to bed he's fine.  See he's awake now."

He smiled and swated the woman away as he hobbled towards me with an IV bag hanging from a rolling pole.  I frowned.  "You okay?"

He nodded.  "Thanks to you - yes, I'll be fine.  No scars I'm told."

I breathed a sigh of releif, "And the woman?"

Dorian smiled.  "My mother will be fine too.  But you need to let them do this.  Nox, you passed out, your energy is turning in on itself I can see it.  You need more energy than you can consome the normal way.  Please."

I shook my head.  "No fucking way they are sticking me with a needle."

Dorian took my left arm and held it under his and pressed his body against me.  "I will distract him while you do this."

"That's not going to work ..."  I didn't get his name out before he was kissing me.  And not just any kiss, the aggression he showed was primal, there was so much more to the kiss than just a distraction.  The want, the need, the fear... He was worried for me.  I pulled back and they chose that moment to prick my skin with that fucking needle.  My heart raced, my body started to shake and Dorian leaned in again and pulled me into his embrace.
"Shhhh...."  He whispered between breaths and kissing.  

Someone patted my arm and Dorian pulled away.  "Better.  Lay down and behave.  I'll be right here.  You need rest."

I sighed and listened to him.  I did as he instructed trying my best not to look at my arm.  Before Dorian laid in the bed next to him he draped the sheet over my arm, "Better?"

I nodded.  I stared at him from across the way.  His body looked fine, but his eyes said he hurt.  Burns always hurt.  I remebered my own.  Nurses crossed our line of sight and were giving us the look.  But I didn't care I looked at Dorian - watched him.  I wanted nothing more than to soothe his pain.  But he watched me with the same intense gaze until we were left alone in the room with the beeping monitors.

Dorian smiled.  "You have a habit of saving my life, you know that?"

"It's worth it."  I grinned at him.  I was feeling sleepy.  

Dorian started humming softlyand I started to sink deeper into sleep.  I started to ask what they did to me but I was gone before the first word hit my mouth, but I could hear the soft melody I had hummed to Dorian earlier and between that and the soft scent of vanilla and cinaomon I drifted off into a near dreamless sleep.
## All The Peices

I didn't wake from a normal dream.  I was breathing hard and my heart was racing but in a good way and I well... you don't need to hear that.  I opened my eyes and found that I was a lone in the room.  I didn't know how long I had slept or what they'd given me to do so.  I sat up and found the IV still in my arm that had caused me to pass out so easily.  I pulled the needle from my arm in a less than ceremonious way. The liquid oozed out and I had to put pressure on the hole in my arm before it quickly closes off.  At least that was a good thing, I was kinda healing.  

Alarms went off in my room and nurses came running but they slowed down once they saw me disconnecting the wires from my body.  "I'm leaving now."

I put my foot down on the floor and stood up but my knees gave way underneath me but a quick nurse caught me and helped me back to sit on the bed.  "No you aren't."

Dorian chose that moment to walk in, he was standing a fresh suit, his hair was neatly done and I could smell the freshly applied after shave that covered up the cinamon and vanilla.  I smiled at him but he stood in the door waiting on the nurses to leave.  Which they didn't until I was lying back down in the bed.  When he walked in he had a bag of food I couldn't make out the different smells as he pulled the bed side table over the bed and started laying out a table setting worthy of the finest restauarant.  "I figured you'd want real food."

I raised an eye brow at him, I wasn't sure if what he called real food and what I did quallified as the same thing.  The food was still hot, he'd just gone to get it.  He started opening containers as he sat down on the edge of the bed facing me on the otherside of the flimsy table.  "They say you need to stay here another couple of days, but if you eat, you can keep that out of your arm.  But you need to keep fueling the repair of your energy."

I grinned at him.  "I can share yours."

He looked up down at me to see if I was joking which I wasn't.  "How so?"

"It's only a theory.  But you can fuel my body as I did your's to heal."

Dorian shook his head, "I'm not Cesari."

"You shouldn't have to be.  As long as you can think and weave the patterns fast enough.  You'll look like Cesari to outsiders but it would be individual threads at one time.  But like I said it's just a theory."

Dorian asked, "And what would this theory entail to test?"

"A willing participant, a person who can touch all four elements preferrably someone who can remember the sequence quickly and who has the reflexes to preform them quickly.  I mean it's a simple weave, but it needs to be maintained for severl minutes in order for there to be enough to help my body heal itself faster."

I laughed.  "You'd think I was the one that was blown up."

Dorian didn't laugh.  I frowned.  "I'm sorry.  How is your mother?"

Dorian patted my hand.  "She is doing excellent thanks to you.  There were no major burns left to heal only first degree for both of us and no internal injuries.  Thank you."

I smiled up at him and my stomach growled.  Dorian finished plating the food.  "After you eat you can show me.  I will try.  It won't hurt you if it goes badly will it?"

"The weaves are harmless to my knowledge so we should be good."

Dorian pulled a few more things out of the corner while I dug into the food he'd placed carefully in front of me.  Chicken catetori piled high with vegetables in a lemon garlic sauce.  "Victor's?" I asked as I stuffed another peice of food in my mouth.

"Yes."  Dorian said as he dropped a bag on my bed.  "He said it has healing powers."

I grinned at him and nodded.  "It does."  I moaned softly through bites. "My god it's good."

Dorian laughed.  "I will be sure to tell Victor."

He pulled out my laptop, my paper work and a few other file folders I hadn't seen before. On one of those tabs I saw Levi Hughes written on it.  I looked up at Dorian, "Did we find Levi?"

Dorian nodded.  "Yes.  He had gone to his room. He's been placed in Dae'lin's watchful care until you are better.  If she could handle you, she can handle him."

"What are the other files?"

Dorian placed a red one on my laptop, "This is the forensics for the first scene.  The blue one is the one two days ago."

"Wait - two days?  I've been sleeping for two days?"

Dorian nodded.  "Yeah.  Did no one tell you?"

I sighed.  "Have there been any other bombings?"

Dorian shook his head.   "No."  But he didn't sound convinced they had blown over.  Dorian continued, "The green folder is the photo footage we took but you already have on your laptop.  The yellow is the second scene.  We had no one as skilled as you or I to do the reconstruction so I don't expect we'll get the same results but I figured it was something you could do lying in bed."

He stood up and straighted his cuffs and leaned over and kissed me softly.  He tasted like toothpaste still and the pepermint didn't quite go so well with my food. But I didn't care I enjoyed the feel of him against me.  I grabbed his tie and pulled him closer and he obliged me a little before he pulled away breathless and straightening the golden tie against his stark white shirt.  "I have to go to work.  I'll be back later with more food.  I think Bonnie wants to send a whole pie your way."

I smiled.  "Alright."  I started to reach for his tie but thought better of it and simply asked, "Another kiss before you leave?  Please?"  I sounded pathetic even to my own ear, but Dorian only chuckled.

He leaned in and kissed me tenderly on the cheek and when I turned to meet his lips he pulled away.  I shook my head, "Fine be that way."

Dorian pressed his lips against mine hard and bit my bottom lip before he pulled away.  "Now I have to go to work."

I grinned at him.  "Thank you. Sorry I rumbled your tie."

He smiled and straightened it again.  "No harm, no foul.  I will see you later Nox."  Dorian turned around and walked out of my hospital room door and a gaggle of nurses at the station outside my room watched him walk off down the hall.  

I grinned and yelled at them, "He's mine!"

They all turned and looked at me and then scattered in small groups heading back tot heir own routes.  Dorian was garnering a lot of attention today. I wondered if he was getting as many proposition as I was - probably more, I thought to myself idly as I finished what was left of the food he'd brought me.  I hadn't realized most of it was gone.  Had I finished it that quickly.  My stomach rumbled and I hit the call button.

A small blonde waltz into my room with a questioning look on her face, "Yes?"

"When is breakfast served around here?"  I asked.

"You **just** ate." She sounded surprised.

"Yeah.  I am feeding a supernatural energy that kinda made me pass out because I overused it.  It's like feeding an army."

She asked, "Has it happened before?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I've never drained myself before.  I've never had cause to delepte my resources before."

"You shouldn't do that."

"Well duh!  I see that now.  How was I supposed to know that splitting my reserves would do that?"

She rolled her eyes at me.  "If I see you using your ability at all while you are in here I will gut you myself - pretty face or not?"

"Pretty face?  I do hope you are talking about Dorian and not me."

She winked at me.  "Not that he'd ever notice anyway with you around."

I grinned, "He'd not notice you like that anyway, Duckling.  He's all men all the time.  Unlike my grand self."

"I heard you were a cocky one."  She left the room and headed down the hall the way Dorian had gone and my stomach rumbled again.  I hoped she was successful in finding food.  As I started looking at the last scene that was sitting on top of my laptop just waiting for me to put the puzzle together.

Dorian had already put the images in that manipulation program we use earlier - two days earlier.  I was going to take a few days to adjust to the missed days.  I started going through the images and placing the peices again.  It wasn't as hard as the first time but the patterns weren't drawn very well.  But I worked the best I could with what I had.

The nurse who was in my room before set a tray of food down on my table and walked away.  I yelled after her.  "And if this isn't enough?"

She turned with a bright smile.  "We'll bring you more.  Drink plenty of water as well."

I nodded, "Always do."

There were three bottles of water on the tray and a lot of fried food. I sighed.  I pressed the call button again.  She showed back up and I smiled pushing the tray away.  "This will make me sick."  I asked, "Can I have my phone?  I'll just order something."

She shook her phone.  "No, I can't let you order food to be delivered.  Your family can bring you food, but ..."  

And as if I had summoned him Jace showed up at my door bearing bags of food.  The pretty blonde nurse turned and smiled, "It seems your family knows you well."

Jace laughed, "You brought him fried chicken and french fries."  Jace picked up a french frie and popped it in his mouth, "Still hot too.  Darling, don't feed him junk.  Protein and vegetables - a little grains and unless it's pasta or fancy smancy bread he won't eat it." Jace grinned, "Just a tidbit."

He stepped inside and placed two paper bags on my table and moved the trahe other one in the room and started eating from it.  "Unless of course you are bringing food to everyone else who might be visiting him.  Then most of us will eat whatever it is."  He rolled his eyes.  "The man is too picky for his own good.  Doesn't know what's good and what's not."  Jace bit into the fried chicken leg and juices ran down his chin.

I rolled my eyes.  "Thanks Jace."  Whatever was in the bag smelled wonderful.  "Mia make it?"

"No I did.  Of course she did.  She figured you were awake now, and that needle in your arm wasn't going to stay in long so she's been cooking for four of you since she found out you had woken up."

I didn't hesitate to open up the bag and find all the glorious smells pushing past my nose.  Mia could cook.  Not as good as me, but she was damn fine.  I didn't care what I pulled out first I ate whatever it was and it was delicious.  The nurse looked at me like I was some alien or something shaking her head as she left muttering something about manners.  So what, I was eating with my fingers.

Jace looked at the laptop screen and frowned.  "You aren't your puzzles."

I only smiled at him and continued eating.  "So.  Dorian?"  There was that certain lit to his voice that implied he wanted details.  

I finished chewing the asapargus I was downing.  "I don't kiss and tell, you know that."

He stuck his tongue out at me.  "Awe, come on.  He's a good lay, the least you could do is share some of the details."

"I haven't slept with him yet, Jace.  There's been like one day where I was seeing him."

Jace stared at me unblinking, "Seriously?  Why the fuck not.  You've been pining over him since the Academy."

"I have not been pining.  We came close.  But I carded him."

"Jeez Nox, what he do?"

"Nothing wrong.  Nothing he wouldn't know not to do."

Jace frowned, "You broke your own rules, how unlike you."

I sighed.  "I wasn't intending to go anywhere with him at the time, it just happened.  His hand, his mouth..."  I could replay everything in my head but my stomach growled and I started the next bowl.

"Damn it boy.  Mia's gonna be cooking for a month if you are eating like this."

"If they let me out of here I can feed myself."

Jace sighed.  "From what I hear they ain't letting you out soon."

I continued eating the homemade mushu pork with my fingers and stared at the laptop screen.  Something clicked and I set the food down and licked my fingers clean.  My fingers were still sticky but the keyboard would just have to be cleaned later.  I moved the peices of the bad drawing around and saw it formed the same general shape as the last one.  It nagged at me, but this one was different it was inverted.

Jace had moved to sit next to me and was watching me manipulate things.  I swapped out the new one for the old one and tried to invert the drawings I had made.  Jace whistled.  "You've only gotten better.  I haven't seen your stuff for a while."

I just nodded as I tried to make the program do what I wanted.  I sighed in fustration, I wanted to push the table away from me in anger but that would do little go so I flung a small fireball at the wall.  No sensors went off and there was only a small spattering of char on the wall.

Jace asked, "What's wrong?  Can I help?"

"I need to invert the peice, it's drawn backwards.  Does that make sense.  I don't know this program well enough."

Jace grinned.  "You never were terribly handy when it came to figure the easy stuff out.  Give you a fucking puzzle with a billion peices and you'd have it done in an hour.  Finding your socks that were under your bed, that took days."

I stuck my tongue out at Jace and picked up my food again.  Jace reached into the bag and handed me a fork.  "There are things called forks.  You eat with them.  Grow up man.  You are fucking a man who likes everything in order."

I sighed.  "I've not fucked him yet Jace."  I heard the anger in my voice and Jace turned to look at me.

"Dude, chill.  I get it.  Just friends."

I sighed, "Sorry.  It's not just friends either."

"What you falling in love with him?"  I could hear the joke in his voice but when I didn't answer him with a revernt denial he turned to look at me, "You're joking, right?"

I shrugged.  "I came back to do just that didn't I?"

"Yeah but with Dorian Vega.  Man you can't start a family with another guy. At least not easily.  He's good in bed Nox.  But he ain't that good.  Not that special to give up your dreams for."

"Who said I had to give up my dreams?  Do you know how many women are throwing themsleves at me?  I already have sex planned with one.  And she doesn't want the kid."

Jace looked at me with astonishment in his eyes.  "You are one lucky S.O.B."

I shrugged and Jace turned the laptop back around to face me.  "That it?"

I nodded, "Fuck me!"

Jace laughed, "Don't mind if I do."

I shook my head.  "I gotta go find someone."## The Chase

Jace was looking at me with curiousity but he didn't try to stop me when I tried to get up out of the bed I was staying in.  I could feel the weakness in my knees but I managed to stand without too much wobbling.  Jace never once attempted to stop me.  This time no buzzing went off.  I was not connected to any monitors as long as I ate they didn't care about me.

I found my bag put in a corner.  It had been neatly packed - Dorian must have gone through it.  I found my phone lying on top of the clothes inside the bag.  I sat quickly dialed a number and set it to speaker phone.  I didn't care what I was wearing, I pulled on the top pair of jeans and a t-shirt as the phone was picked up.  "Nox?"

"Dorian, I know who it is."

Dorian's voice came over the phone but it still sounded surprised. "Know who what is?"

"The one who hurt you."  My voice was filled with venom even I knew that I didn't have.  That's when I noticed Jace was standing beside me waiting.

I stood up and tried to walk around him.  "Nox, someone else can handle this.  Just let me call your dad, he's been working the case while you've been in here."

"Jace, get out of my way."  

Dorian spoke quickly. "Jason do not let him leave.  I'll be right there to help."  And then the line went dead.  I couldn't imagine Dorian sprinting his way here no matter the cause but I had to be gone before he got here.  I knew he'd make me stay and he'd use every tool in his aresenal.  But he only needed to ask me and I would...  What did that mean?  

I pushed the curious thoughts away as I took another step to get around Jace but he moved to interept me.  "Jace, move or I will move you.  I don't want to hurt you."

"I know that.  But you can't go running off half cocked after whoever this person is because you aren't in your right mind.

"Jason.  Move!"  It was his last warning.

He stood his ground.   I watched him make ready for anything I could do to him.  He thought I would use magic, my ability.  He was faster and stronger than I was, but Jason Hill knew me better than any person ever.  He knew my first instinct, so I didn't go with it.  I rushed past him in a spurt of energy that I barely knew I had.  He looked at me with agony in his eyes as he toppled over out of surprise and worry.  I could see both emotions etched clearly on his face when I turned back to see him before walking out the door.

He could have caught me, but I threw up a wall of air in the doorway and he stood staring after me.  He didn't even bother trying to get out. 

I didn't take the stairs. Dorian knew I would avoide them, so the elevator it was.  I headed for the Dorimitory floors.  My anger fueled me, the fear slide around the anger not to bother my determination.  I would find Levi, and he would be put to justice.  I had every right to hunt him down and kill him.  Venatori law was Venatori law and I was a hunter, it was my job to put him down.  But even though he'd hurt Dorian I knew I coldn't just do that.  He was just a kid...

I walked through the elevator doors to the boy's dorms and found Mr. Larry sitting at his usual desk.  I could speak to him for hours about anyhing and everything when I was a child, but today he looked up at me and I only had one question.  "Where is Levi Hughes?"

"In his room."  Mr Larry said flatly.  "I'll go get him."

I shook my head.  "Just tell me where it is I'll get him myself."

"What's this all about Nox?"  he asked me standing up to block my way.

"He's marked."

The shock of what I had said registered.  "He's only a child.  Surely he didn't do anything that bad."

I just looked at him.  "Tell me where he is."

"Of course, Venatori."  He handed me a slip of paper with his room number on it with a note that said, "Don't kill him. please."

I looked at Mr. Larry.  "Apparently you know nothing of the man I became."  I didn't wait for his response as I headed for the door to the wing Levi's room was on.  I turned he corner and I saw Levi standing in his door talking with Garrett.  I froze in mid step.

Garrett left the other direction and Levi went into his room and neither of them noticed my frozen self standing in the hall.  I don't know how long I stood there willing myself to move.  The fury had been replaced with fear.  Why was Garrett talking with Levi?  Where they working together?

I started moving.  I had to figure this out.  Levi had to answer for his crimes but I would no be the one to kill him.  I was about to knock on the door when I heard the building go into lock down.  The lights went dim and the halls turned a sickly shade of red.  All the electronic doors released and would lock the moment they closed until someone in security shut them down.  I didn't have time to wonder what was going on before Levi opened his door and ran straight into me knocking me around.  

He stumbled and picked himself up and started running towards the stairs.  I didn't know why he was running he couldn't know why I was here unless he suspected...  Why had Garrett been here.

I ran after him.  The electroic doors to the stair well had recently been opened or theyd have been locked shut.  But I missed them, so I cut through the lock with a fine thread of fire.  I heard footstes racing up.  I followed.  I was weaker than I should be.

I could feel my knees straining with the effort of taking the stairs three at a time but I was gaining on him.  Levi was trying each door at every landing but nothing would budge.  He'd catch sight of me and start moving again.  He never even thought to use his gift.   How unfortunate or him.  

Three flightes before the roof Levi stopped checking doors and kept running.  What did he think he was going to do ... jump.

I had given him the key out.  I increased my pace.  He was full Venatori and faster than I was, and he was already out on the roof, the door was busted beyond repair, he'd finally decided his power was a worthy tool to use.  He stood by the edge of the room looking over.

I yelled over the howling wind that threatened to bring rain down upon us.  "Levi stop!"

He turned around and looked at me.  He was smiling and started walking back towards me.  "It had to be you.  You know you won't stop us.  The Venatori will fall."

Stupid villians always spouting their egotistical plans.  I let him continue speaking.  "I didn't kill the head of the snake, but someone else will.  But you won't catch me.  You are a poor excuse for a Venatori - half human.  They should have killed you when you were born."

Levi turned and ran towards the edge.  I followed.  He jumped and soared over the edge tucking himself into a ball to increase speed.  But he didn't spread any elements, he plummeted down faster than I'd ever dared.  I thought as quickly as I could and I sped down in his direction the same way, softening the ground as I did, I had wings of air ready for the moment I caught the stupid boy.  

When my body rammed into his I finished the pattern but there was only a few more seconds of falling before we rammed our selves into the ground - no matter how soft it was it was going to hurt like hell.  I thickened my wings and tried to slow us further but it wasn't enough.  I felt my body shatter on impact and then there was nothing but darkness...# Part II: Terror

## Rise and Fall of Nightmares

There was only darkness at first.  And then the pain.  The bone shattering, blood boiling pain radiating through every cell in my body.  Clarity never resolved, everything remained black and pain filled.  Seconds, minutes, days of nothing but soul crushing pain waved through my body.  And then clarity came - a voice in my head that said, "You are mine."

The red eyes of my demons tormmented me from that moment out.  Unable to move, unable to breathe or see anything else.  The demon rode the waves of pain and was the only illumination in the darkness.  Weeks?  I'd lost track of any amount of time.  I watched the demon's eyes get clearer, watched as the tentacles grew shape and formed and raked my body in places it never had.  The pain made me want to scream out but my mouth was dry and raw and no sound escaped my throat.

The soft scent of vanilla followed quickly by cinamon rode in on currents of the winds in my mind.  Images drifted in my head along with the floating red eyes and tentacles.  A man with deep blue eyes, his hands touching my face - a soft kiss and my mind went blank.  There was nothing but the soft presence in my soul.  

But it too was replaced by the pain and darkness.  Months?  Years?  There was nothing but pain, the demon crept back in, making hmself known again.  "Mine," it claimed in a rasping voice that tore through my head like a sledgehammer.  "Mine!"

The pain became normal.  The pain waxed and waned on the currents of the air.  For every up there was a down and for every in an out.  It pulsed in me like my heart beat.  

And then when I thought the pain had become nothing more than a dull ache I saw a light. The light called to me, I blinked and my eyes were stunned by the light - it was too bright.  I covered my eyes with my hand, my skin felt cold and clammy and there were wires restricting my movment.  My heart started to race.  Panic flooded my body and I tried to sit up but pain lanced through my body.  Instruments of fleshy heat touched my arms holdng me down.  Sounds like words never touched my ears.  I wanted to scream but I couldn't.

A soft rush under my skin and then there was darkness.  And in the darkness the demon returned.  "It's about time."  And the demon shown his face, his eyes no longer read.  The world had solidified in my mind and I knew the man in front of me.  He worse a smile that I hated, his eyes gleamed with a dark lust.  He touched my skin and I felt the hfire burn my skin.  

My eyes shot open and I was looking up at the man.  He smiled down at me and laughed.  "You are mine!"

I couldn't speak, I couldn't think as I drifted back into nothingness.  The dull ache of pain left and was comforted by the soft touch against my hand.  A familiar voice spoke to me but the words didn't reach me.  I moved towards the voice.  I tried to open my eyes but the tender touch covered them.  "Don't move, Nox."

I grabbed the wrist holding my eyes close and tried to push it away.  But it was unmovable. The grip moved from gently touching me to pinning my wrists above my head.  I felt a hot breath against my neck as the voice whispered in my ear.  "Nox.  It's okay don't move.  Keep your eyes closed and don't move and I'll let you go.  They will restrain you if they come in here and you are like this.  Lie still. Please."

I did as I was instructed unsure of why I complied.  Lips brushed my ear in a gentle kiss.  "Good.  Listen to me."

I relaxed more and I felt the presense leave.  I heard a chair scraping against the floor and smelled vanilla and cinamon.  I knew it meant something but my brain was foggy and I was barely managing the little control I had.  "You've been hurt badly."  I felt his hand touch mine.  It was warm and soft in my hand.  It hurt to move.  I groaned.  The sound of my own voice sounded foreign - strained.

"Shhhh... Don't move."  I tried to open my eyes, but his hand touched my eyes.  "Just stay still, quiet and don't open your eyes.  Please?  Let me talk."  His hand slid down my face and caressed it I leaned my head into it.  I heard him smile.  "Touch, is what you want?  I can do that.  Just no more moving.  You jumped off the roof Nox.  You almost died.  You broken nearly every bone in your body. They almost lost you a few times, but your body started rapidly healing, and then stopped and would start again.  You've been trashing around and making things worse."

"You told me I could share my energy to help before.  You never showed me how."  He sounded sad.

A wave of images flahsed through my mind.  Sitting in a hospital room flirtig with Dorian.  Dorian... I thought about the patterns in my head that I had wanted to show Dorian and I wove them weakly from memory.  I heard Dorian gasp as saw what I was doing.  He put his hand on my chest and tried to make me stop.  "Nox.  Stop.  You are too weak."

I tried to speak but my voice only cracked.  I kept trying.  "You. to help."

I could feel my energy depleting.  I felt the fog settle over my mind as I drifted yet again off into oblivion.

There was pain, worse than before but the demon didn't come, there was only he soft scent of vanilla and cinamon and images of Dorian floating through my mind.  His deep blue eyes staring back at me.  

I opened my eyes, the room was dim and I could hear the soft beeping of machines nearby. My mouth felt dry and I was hungry.  I moved and it hurt but I found the nurse call button and touched it.  There were no voices from the little speaker, but the door to my room opened and she walked over slowly.  "Nox?"

I tried to speak but only one word came out audible. "Hungry."

She smiled at me and laughed.  "Okay.  But it's a liquid diet. "  She picked up a cup and dropped a few ice chips in my mouth, "This should help."

And it did a little.  I tried to sit up and she put her hand on my bare chest, "Stay still I'll raise the bed and then I'll let your doctor know you are awake."

"Dorian?"

She laughed.  "I sent him home to sleep about an hour ago.  After you started improving, I told him he had to sleep in a proper bed."  She smiled.  "I was surprised he left."

I smiled.  "Can I have my phone?"

She shook her head.  "No sorry.  I will call him and tell him you are awake. But your Doctor is first."

I sighed.  "Do I have to keep this thing in my arm?"

"You at least haven't ripped it out yet.  But yes you do.  Let the doctor see you first."

I sighed, "You are luck it hurts to move.  I want to see Dorian."

"He'll be here when he gets here.  You had other visitors too."  

I shrugged.  "Who wouldn't want to come stare at me while I sleep."  

She smiled.  And I asked, "I didn't catch your name last time."

"Shannon."  She smiled brightly, "And you never asked before."

"That is completely my bad."  I started coughing.  

Ana handed me a cup of ice, "No more talking.  No moving.  No nothing until the doctor sees you."  She grinned at me, "Or I won't call Mr. Vega."

I mimed the motion of zipping my lips with a smile and sucked on the ice chips until a familiar face was standing in my doorway. 

Ana stepped in and said, "The first of many doctors who you have to see today.  Behave, or I will keep my promise."

I rolled my eyes and then pointed out my window then stuck my tongue out at her.  Dorian was standing in the hallway leaning against the nurses station speaking to another nurse there, a brunette with a purple streak in her hair that I was pretty sure I knew but at the moment I couldn't place her.  Ana closed the blinds and stuck her tongue out at me and I grinned.  Well played.

Margo closed the door after Ana left.  "How are you feeling Nox?"

"I hurt - everywhere."

Margo sat down in the chair beside the bed.  "That happens when you break every bone in your body."

"Why are you here?"  I asked.

"Evaluating your mental state."

"So they think I jumped to kill myself?"  I sighed.  It wasn't the first time that they'd tried to keep me from the roof by claiming I was trying to kill myself.

"That's their angle."  But Margo didn't sound convinced.

"I'm not entirely sure they are wrong, Nox."

"Seriously?  You think I'd kill myself?"

Margo sighed. "It's not like you've not tried in the past."

"I was seven."

"And again at 14."

I was angry.  "I didn't try to kill myself when I was 14.  It was a fucking accident.  I thought you beleived me when I told you that."

Margo sighed.  "I reserved judgment Nox.  You jumped from the building and you almost killed yourself, landing on the cement sidewalk instead of the grass you claimed to be aiming for."

"I was messing around.  I was playing with patterns.  I only got bumps and bruises and broken arm from the bad landing."

"And this time?"  Margo asked.  "Were you saving the boy like Dorian?"

I shook my head and it hurt.  "No.  He jumped I was trying to catch him.  He was the one setting off bombs."

"And you told no one.  No one knows what you and that boy were doing."

"I told Dorian.  I called him.  Told him I knew who it was.  Who had hurt him.  Jace was there."

Margo nodded.  "They both said the same thing, but you didn't tell them who.  Dae'lin says that Dorian believes you are correct based on the puzzle you were putting together together.  But Dorian isn't a hunter Nox."

I sighed.  "No he just has a fucking photographic memory for **everything** he sees.  The puzzle pieces were inverted.  The second one made it click it filled in the tell tale peices that were missing from the first.  Levi showed me that weave.  He created it the testing room for me to see him ability to work with all the elements at the same time."

"So you what?  Chased him to the roof and he jumped.  Why would he do that?"  Margo asked.

"Because he thought he'd get away.  He thought he was better than I was and that I wouldn't follow him but I was the one who showed him how in the first place."  I sighed.  "In hindsight I shouldn't have followed, he was going to die either way.  But I was blinded by anger.  I wanted him to pay for what he'd done.  For hurting Dorian, and Nick and Mrs. Vega."

"I'm sorry Nox.  There will be a formal investigation.  Now that you are up and awake they will move you to the pschye ward for sucide watch until further notice."

I shrugged.  "Whatever.  It's not the first time and I doubt it'll be the last time."

Margo stood up and sighed.  "Nox.  They will take away children if they think you are a risk to their safety."

I growled, "No they won't."

"You really think your childhood was that bad?"

I crossed my arms and frowned.  "I'm done talking since no matter what I say is going to be used against me anyway."

"Nox."  Margo took a step and touched my check with the tips of her fingers.  "You know I beleive you."

"Yeah.  You beleive me but as usual you have too little power."

She sighed.  "Dr. Wilton will be in to see you in a moment.  He will give you the offical ruling and will be your doctor in the interim.  I've been found unreliable."

I asked, "Why?"

Margo looked at me with sadness.  "I've been dating your father for the past three years.  He came to me interested in you, but I couldn't speak to him about you.  We hit it off, and have been seeing each other since."

"It figures.  Why not have my motherly figure fucking my father."

She slapped me hard and I could feel the blooming hand print against my cheek.  "That is uncalled for.  I will forgive you this one - act a child again and you and I will terminate this relationship."

I looked down.  "I'm sorry."

"Really?"

"Yes, ma'am.  I shouldn't have said that.  My anger got the best of me.  I'm not angry at you.  Or my father. Just another thing to deal with."  I rolled over on to my side with my back facing her, "I'd rather be left alone now."

Margo put her hand on my shoulder and I had the urge to jerk it away but I hurt just rolling over so I didn't bother.  "Two more doctors and you can see Dorian."

"Such generoisity."## Doctors

Margo left the room and I could feel the tears rolling down my cheeks.  I had been delibrately mean.  I wanted to apologize more than I already had, but she was gone.  A new set of footsteps followed her wake.  I could tell by the smel of his cologne that he was older and male. 

"Mr. Sétanta.  I'm here to discuss things with you, if you can turn and face me."

I complied only so I didn't embarass Margo.  I couldn't imagine the face the man saw I was thankful for the lack of eye make up.  He didn't look like much, his hair was bristly and his eye glasses were thick.  I wondered if he were pretending to be human or if he was really this bad - Venatori with glasses was nearly unheard of.  Possible but very improbable.

"Tell me about yourself."

I frowned, "Really?"  He nodded and I sighed.  "You know my name and all that stuff.  I'm an improbable Minorem Cesari ranked the highest this generation.  I'm reckless and obnoxious and I don't have any friends.  Well that's a lie.  I have one friend."

"And this is what defines you?"

"For the most part."

Dr. Wilton sat down and jotted a few notes and then looked upa at me.  "I have read your files from Dr. Silverman and Ms. Rivera.  I see you have several attempts on your own life.  Can you tell me about the first time?"

"What do you want to know?  You want to know how it felt to take a razor slice of air and run it down my wrists?  Or do you want to know the feeling of the life running out of you before you passed out?  How about how it felt waking up in the hospital strapped to a bed so I wouldn't hurt myself.  Or what about.."

"Tell me why you did it?"  He interrupted.

I sighed and stared up at the ceiling.  "I was depressed.  I was 6.  I had been beaten for a year, my mother left me in the care of my abuser and I had no friends.  Life wasn't worth living anymore.  I was afraid, but I didn't understand what being Venatori meant at the time. I didn't know I couldn't hurt myself fast enough to do permanant damage."
 
"And the second time?"

I rolled my eyes.  "I didn't try to kill myself but the one time.  Margo taught me to value my life after that.  Gave me assignments to deal with my issues.  We stopped talking about what happened with my teacher and started dealing with my mental health.  It helped.  Knowing I was wired differently.  We tried medicine, but I reacted badly to Venatori meds and the human meds didn't work.  So we had to find other mechanisms to cope.  That's when I started jumping."

"Jumping gave me control of my fears.  It gave me hope.  If I could defeat my fear of heights to do that, I could do anything."

"So the second time ..."

"Was an accident.  I jumped.  I was experimenting with different weaves.  The wind caught it unexpectedly and I was carried over the cement and I got bruses and broke my arm."

"What about this time?"

I sighed.  "I was catching a bad guy.  I was doing my job.  It's that simple."

"You weren't authorized to go after this person.  No one knew what you were doing.  That was against protocol."

I shrugged.  "Whatever.  I jumped after him to keep him from running.  He ran when the place went into lockdown.  Tell me why they beleived Dorian enough to shut down, but not that I was chasing him.  But you are just doing your job so just tell me what I need to know and let the next egg head sit here in your seat and do their job so I can go sit in some holding cell twiddling my thumbs."

Dr. Wilton's face light up like a christmas tree with reds and blues.  He vein pulsed.  I was tired of being nice.  "You are here-by reprimanded to suicide watch until the investigation of this negligence is finalized."

He stood up and swung the door open and it smashed against the wall.  He stammered at the nurses.  "I'd sedate him before he's seen by another."  And he walked off down the hall I hoped I didn't have to see him again, but Margo wasn't to be my counsel on this one.

The third doctor stepped inside her green eyes sparkled and the patterns around her swirled and swayed and I had to look away.  I couldn't make myself stop seeing her patterns she was so uncontrolled.  I had never seen anyone with that much lack of control even a child who was first coming into their power.

"Mr. Sétanta.  I am Dr. Amara Eriksen.  I'd like to ask you about what Mr. Vega did."

"I don't know what you are talking about.  I have been unconscious for a while now.  No one's even told me."  I stated flatly.

"While you were unconscious you were nearly dead.  You started healing, stopped and would start again.  Until Mr. Vega came in here and spoke to you.  You were lucid for a few moments we have it on video.  But nothing came through."

"What did I say?"

She sat down.  "Dorian said you had wanted to show him how to share energy."

I smiled.  "Did I say anything?"

She nodded.  "You.  To hep."

"I must have showed him how to feed me resources to help my body heal."

"Can you explain that?"

I shook my head.  "Not right now.  I'm starving. And I'd like to see my ...."  I smiled.  "I'd like to see Dorian." I had wanted to say boyfriend, but I don't think Dorian would appreciate that sentiment yet.

"I will be stuck in a holding cell until futher notice, and you can ask me all the questions you like.  Until I see Dorian, and eat for a few days I will not speak to anyone else."  I closed my eyes and leaned back against the pillow.

"So that's it?"  She asked.

I didn't answer I was quiet in the darkness behind my eyes.  I was going to stand my resolve.  She sighed and left the room.  The door was almost closed when Dorian stepped inside with a frown on his face.  "Nox you have to talk to these people."

"No I don't.  I have days or weeks to talk to them.  But I wanted to see you."

Dorian smiled.  "They are monitoring everything in here."

I nodded.  "I'll behave.  I can barely move anyway."

Dorian chuckled.  "Good to know.  But watch what you say as well."  He sat down on the edge of the bed and touched my cheek.  "You need to shave."

I ran my fingers over my chin and thought I did as well.  "How long have I been out?"

"Almost two months."  Dorian said flatly.  "Most of it you were thrashing around and they had to tie you down.  Until you showed me what to do.  I didn't get it at first but then you passed out and I could only try."

I smiled.  "Thank you.  We are probably even now."

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  That only counts as one.  You've saved me twice. And if we get technical you saved my mother and I owe you for that too."

"Fine, but at least it's closer now."  I grined at him.  "I'm hungry."

"I placed an order and you should have food soon."  Dorian ran his fingers through my hair, "Your roots are showing too."

I laughed.  "Do I need to freshen up after my two months of sleep?"

Dorian smiled. "I don't mind.  But you shouldn't be shaving.  I can help if you'd like."

"I'd like."  I grinned at him.  "We can leave the color out though if you'd prefer."

Dorian ran his fingers through my hair again.  "I told you I like the color."

The door opened and a tray of food came in with an orderly.  He smiled at Dorian and when Dorian was taking the tray from him the orderly was checking him out.  I winked at the orderly as he left and smiled.  Dorian was busy with the food as the orderly left.  I grinned at him.  "He was checking you out."

Dorian sighed.  "That's been happening a lot these past two months.  Openly involved with a man seems to bring them out of the woodwork.  With the females too it seems.  I've had three propositions."

I picked up a peice of chicken with my fingers and popped it in my mount.  Dorian handed me a fork.  "You have no manners."

I stuck my tongue out at him.  He leaned in and kissed my cheek.  "Eat."

I ate as instructed while Dorian rummaged through another bag sitting in a corner.  "You weren't very nice to Dr. Silverman earlier."

"You saw that?"  I asked through mouthfuls but I didn't look at Dorian.  I didn't want to see his expression.

"Yes."

"I shouldn't have said it.  I don't have a problem with Margo with my father.  I hate that they use it against her."

Dorian put his hand on my shoulder.  "She knows.  At least that's what she said.  She said you'd feel bad, she said don't be surprised when he gets all mushy about it."

"I don't get mushy."  I grinned.

"That's what she said."  Dorian sat down on the bed next to me with shaving cream and a straight razor setting on the table.  He just watched me eat.

"So you really are going to help?"  I nodded toward his little kit. "And the old fashioned way."

He nodded.  "It's been a while since I've shaved another face, but yes."

I swallowed the last of what I had been eating.  "Are just going to stare at me whileI eat, or would you like me to stop.  I could be a while otherwise."

He grinned. "I don't mind. My day is clear."

"Clear?  Why did you clear your day?  You have kids to take care of."

Dorian smiled.  "I have you to take care of.  When I found out Jace was the only one coming to see you I came more often.  Your father has been here, but he's been out in the field with my father more often.  Nurse Morganstern says he doesn't stay long, and he didn't like watching you thrashing around.  She also said the only time you were ever calm was when I was here."

I smiled and looked down trying to look like I was busying myself with looking for the napikin I had dropped.  I knew why that was.  I'm not sure Dorian did.  He put his fingers under my chin and made my eyes meet his.  "It's alright."  He smiled and starte lathering the shaving cream in his hands and dabbing it against my skin.  It was cold, but his hands were warm I closed my eyes and rested while Dorian worked.  "I could shave it all off."

My eyes bolted open and he was grinning at me.  "I take it you don't want that."

"Preferably not."

Dorian smiled.  "I'll be careful."

I closed my eyes again as Dorian sharpened the blade on the leather strap, the sound was not comforting but I tried not to panic.  I trusted Dorian - I trusted him with my life.  I counted down from ten to try and calm my anxiety.  Dorian caught on to my anxiety and started humming the song my Nanny had sung to me as a child.  The razor touced my neck and the cold steel sent shivers down my spin.  I was really going to let him do this.  Dorian worked with percision.  "I found the name of the song.  Though the lyrics were in Draconic I'm not surprised you don't remember the words."

"What's the name?"  I managed to get out after three attempts.

"Sleep little dragon is what it translates to.  I can't speak draconic."

I tried not to move but it made me smile.  Dorian was careful.  He even used scisors to trim what he had left of my goatee and mustashe.  By the time he was wiping my face clean I had dozed several times.  I was completely woken up when Dorian stood up.  I opened my eyes and frowned.  "Not going anywhere,"  he said.  "Just putting things away.  You should sleep though."

"I'll have plenty of time to sleep over the next little while."

Dorian frowned.  "Sorry about that.  I wished they'd beleive me but aparently I'm not quite as impartial as they'd like."

"Because we've kissed."

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  I doubt they care about that.  The first day I gave them an ear full about how they needed to help you.  I cited a few Clandestine laws at them.  After you started getting a little better I gave them another and asked them why they stopped helping before I realized that you'd just run out of your own resources."  Dorian sighed.  "I started looking through your laptop in hopes that I'd find something on what you did to me.  But you didn't seem to have anything.  Someone wasn't happy I had been borrowing your laptop and reported it.  Theft is not looked highly upon, and since you were in a coma I couldn't exactly get you to say I hadn't been stealing it."

"I gave you the password.  I wouldn't have cared."

Dorian nodded.  "Thanks but it took some of my credibility away.  Ruining my image in all sorts of ways for you."

I frowned despite the smile that played on Dorian's face.  "Move over."  Then he looked at me a little closer, "Can you move over?"

I nodded and moved slowly to one side of the bed.  Dorian laid down on his side next to me draping an arm over my stomach, the added weight hurt a little, but I wasn't about to make him move it.  He settled in next to him his head against the pillow and I leaned in against him.  "I am not ruining anything by the way - my image.  I'm just adding you to it.  Now sleep."

I closed my eyes and leaned my head agaisnt Dorian's chest.  It wasn't quite comfortable but I was soon drifting alone in the darkness the only thing dancing in front of me was images of Dorian.  He hummed softly and I could smell his soft sweet scent and I felt safe as I let oblivion take me into the depths of my own darkness.## Relocation

I woke feeling slightly more rested but there was pain still everywhere.  I woke to Dorian's shallow breathing of sleep.  His arm still draped over my body.  I shifted uncomfortablly and he stirred.  He smiled down at me, "Hey."

"Hey yourself."  I said sleepily.

The table had been moved to the side I was sleeping on and I picked up a peice of bread.  There also looked to be more food than I remembered on it.  With a note.  I tried to sit up but that failed in a massive shootin pain everywhere in my body.  "Don't move Nox. Or they will have to strap you down again."

I nodded.  "There is a note."

Dorian sat up and reached for the folded peice of paper and handed it to me as he leaned back down and laid next to me.  I opened it.  "You need to stop doing this.  I'm getting tired of cooking for you.  Love you.  Get better.  - Mia"

I grinned and set the card down.  "I'm sure I will hear all about how she walked in on us later."

Dorian smiled lazily at me.  "If she's friends with you I'm sure you will."

"She's family."  I said absently.  I picked up the bowl closest to me and popped open the lid and started eating.  My stomach rumbled the second it smelled whatever delicious concontion lie in the plastic container.  

Dorian got up and I watched him stretch out the kinks, sleeping that way couldn't have been comfortable.  He smiled at me as I watched him.  He didn't come back to sit with me he busied himself with other things in the room.  Packing bags and looking for something.  He dropped a pair of shorts and a clean shirt on the bed.  "They will be moving you today I'm sure you'd like to be in something a little more suitable than a hospital gown."

I laughed.  "What you don't want all the pretty nurses and orderlys checkout out my ass?"

Dorian chortled.  "Whatever you want love."

I smiled happily.  "Love?"

He looked at me with a steady gaze before he answered.  "You started it."

I nodded.  "I did.  I..."

Dorian took a few steps and put his finger against my lips.  "I already know.  I am not sure why, or how this happened after one day, but I feel the same.  I would watch you from the other side of this room.  The window was always open and the door always closed.  You'd thrash with whatever nightmares you were having in your coma.  But the moment I opened the door you'd settle down into a quiet slumber.  It was like you knew I was there.  Nurse Morgenstern said it only happened with me.  I had asked even when Mr. Hill visited and she said, he'd come in lie down with you never working about whether or not you'd hurt him, but you never stopped twitching even though he was lying next to you."

"Jace hever made me feel safe.  He made me feel loved, but the nightmares were still there.  Always there.  Jace is used to my nightmares, he'd sleep with me like that when we were kids.  He'd push me out of bed some days because I was worse than other nights."

"Have you ever had a good nights rest?"  Dorian asked softly.

I shook my head.  "Not since I can remember.  There may have been a night or two but they are hardly worth remembering."

Dorian frowned.  "They will have to strap you down again while you heal."

I nodded.  "Probably.  Though if you try again, it might take the pain away."

Dorian smiled.  "I can try.  With your conscious instruction I might get more done."  He didn't hesitate he stepped closer to me and put his hands above me.  "First thing is to get all the elements flowing.  The threads were thin, the pattern you showed me was simple enough."

Dorian started with air.  "Start with water," I suggested.  Dorian nodded and started creating water, then air, fire and earth.  He rotated through all four elements.  I grinned at him.  He moved faster through each pattern before he touched my chest with one hand and my stomach with the other.  

I couldn't see the weaves but my back arched and I could feel the crawling of every cell in my body.  I wanted to scream but the pain was so bad I couldn't even open my mouth.  I don't know how long Dorian stood there feeding me his energy but he took a step back and almost stumbled.  He was smiling at me.  "I need to eat now."

I did my best to nod in the direction of the food.  He took a peice of bread and started nibbling at him.  "Did it help?"

I held up one finger from the hand on the bed that he could see.  He nodded.  and ate fully.  He looked ravenous.  

I managed to move and it didn't send shooting pains through my body.  "Yeah.  It helped I think.  But it hurt."

Dorian frowned.  "Did I do soemthing wrong?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I assume it's suppose to hurt when your body is doing double duty healing."

"It didn't hurt when you did it to me"

"I think it's the nature of the injury.  The worse it is the more painful it is.  It's hurt when I've done it to myself.  It could just be my reaction." I tried to reassure Dorian.  "I feel beter.  Honest.  Moving isn't kiling me."

The door to my room opened and a brunette with a purple streak stepped inside.  "I see you are both awake now.  Mr. Vega can I speak with him alone."  Her voice was familiar as was her face but I couldn't quite place her.

I shook my head.  "He's not going anywhere unless it's an emergency."

She frowned at me and I remembered her face then.  "If that's how you want to play it."

I smiled at her.  "He'll just watch from the camera on the other side anyway so what's the point Madison."

"You remembered my name.  I'm suprised."  she sounded incredulous - she didn't beleive that I'd remember her.  Remember the first person I ever had sex with.

"I can hardly forget you.  Even in the pain induced haze I'm in now.  One doesnt' forget their first, Madison."

She rolled her eyes.  "Can we put that behind us where it belongs.  We are adults now."

Dorian chuckled.  "You might be but I have my doubts about him."

She grinned and nodded her head towards Dorian.  "I like him."

I smiled. "Me too."

A deep blush rose in Madison's face.  "Sorry didn't mean to..."

"It's alright.  What do you need Nurse Pratt?" I asked.

"We are moving you today.  And I will be your nurse in the ward.  Now that you are awake, we need you to voluntairly submit yourself.  It will look better if you do it instead of court issued."

"I'm not admitting I'm sucidal to anyone.  I didn't try to kill myself."

Madison sighed.  "Okay.  But you won't be able to leave and you'll be under strict supervision if the court refers you to us.  Meaning no visitors, no contact with other residents."

I looked at Dorian and I couldn't imagine not having him there at least for a few minutes.  "Fine I'll sign the paperwork." I asked, "Why didn't you just get my father to sign it."

"We did try.  He wouldn't sign it.  Dr. Silverman wouldn't sign it.  Even Ms. Rivera wouldn't sign it.  You had no legal guardian.  Mr. Vega was never asked because as far as all records are concerned both of you are single."  

"We've been on one date.  And that wasn't exactly a date either."

Madison laughed, "You don't act like you've only just met.  The way you calmed down with him around, Nox.  The concern Mr. Vega shares for you.  You act like a couple hwo's been together for years."

I realized that there was a lot more to our relationship than I had originall thought.  I wasn't the only one who'd fallen fast.  I smild at Dorian then back at Madison, "We are just that perfect."

Dorian laughed and Madison rolled her eyes.  "I'll bring the paperwork in and you can sign it.  Mr. Vega, if you'd like to help him get dressed since moving is a bit rough right now for him.  I'd appreciate it.  We'd like to show him to his new room."

I sighed as Madison left.  So much for spending more time with Dorian alone even if it was in a hospital room.  The door shut and Dorian closed the blinds on the windows.  I grinned at him as he walked my direction.  "What you don't want them seeing what I'm sure they've already seen?"

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  That's not it."

Dorian sat me up and untied the knot at the back of my neck holding the gown closed.  His hands grazed my skin sending shockwaves through my body.  My attention was completely on Dorian as he helped me sit with my legs over the edge of the bed.  My body was starting to ache which was good and bad - partly because most of it was real pain and the other part was my lust for Dorian's touch.  

I sat naked on the bed once the gown had been completely removed the sheet was covering the more intimate parts of my body, Dorian had left it descretely in place as he pulled the gown from my arms.  He was protecting my modesty - as if I had some.

He knelt down and I watched him help me slide boxers over my feet.  I had to steand up, my knees felt like jelly as I stood there incapable of doing anything else.  Thsi was going to suck if this remained the same for more than the day.  

I sat back down and Dorian's fingers lingered on my hips before he started with the shorts.  He helped me stand up again and pulled them to my hips.  He was careful  with me.  Every touch carefully placed but still eliciting the same sparks through my body.  My heart was racing in my chest.  My mouth was dry and everything pointed towards a panic attack but I knew that wasn't it, there was no fear.

Dorian helped me sit back down before he started with my t-shirt.  Lifting my arms above my head hurt worse than standing up.  I tried not to show the pain but Dorian moved faster than he had before when he looked into my eyes as he pulled the shirt down over my head.  I leaned forward and felt the pain in my back muscle spring to life, but I kissed Dorian anyway.  I wanted to feel his lips against mine.  He stepped closer alleviating some of the strain, his hands running along my sides as his lips parted mine and the kiss pushed us both into a breathless moment.  He pulled away slowly and looked into my eyes.  I could see the heat in them.  I smiled.  "Thank you."

Dorian nodded still catching his breath.  "Anytime."

I laughed.  "I'd rather next time you take them off instead of put them on."

A small blush rose in Dorian.  "Maybe next time."

"Only when you are ready."  I lifted my hand to his cheek.  "I'll wait forever for you if I need to."

Dorian smiled.  "You don't need to wait, Nox."  He leaned in and kissed me softly.  "I'm waiting on you."

On me?  I didn't get a chance to ask him before the door opened.  "You ready to move Nox.  Mr. Vega..."

I interrupted.  "Dorian.  You make him sound old, he's your age."

Madision nodded.  "Dorian is welcome to join us while we settle you in.  But he will have to follow policy and only join you during visiting hours from here on out.  If you could sign here."

I sighed and signed the dotted line - willingly submitting myself to the pschye ward for sucide watch.  It was the only way I was going to be able to see anyone other than my nurses and doctors and I truly didn't want to miss out on Dorian.## Confessions

I hated feeling like an invalid, but I couldn't stand more than a few seconds before my knees buckled so Madison had a wheelchair waiting.  She pushed me while an orderly followed with my things which at the moment consisted of mostly paper bags full of food Dorian and Mia had brought me.  Dorian walked beside me.  I wanted to hold his hand, well I wanted to do more than that but it was uncomfortable to move so I kept m hands to myself.  Even sitting in the chair was painful.  Had I really broken every bone in my body?  I remember the pain I felt on inpact, it didn't surprise me really, but every bone?  It did feel like it though.

We took the elevator as the wheelchair wasn't going to manage the stairs.  Dorian knelt down next to and tried to distract me some.  He hummed the little tune again.  I grinned, "You are getting good at that."

He smiled.  "It seems to work for both of us."

"I'll have to remember that."  I said as the doors dinged open and Madison rolled me out of the elevator.  It was a short trip from the infirmary to the level of the pschye residences.  It was a wing in the adult residences with much better security and monitoring.  It said a lot about the Venatori that we had such a wing in our residences.  But then, when there were issues around the world, they came here too.  It was the best place to keep the mentally unstable Venatori and other supernatural creatures.  I heard there were a few dragons and were's here.  Vampires are usually killed my their own kind when they are mentally unstable - they aren't likely to get better.

Madison wheeled me through the locked double doors and stopped by the entrance desk.  She handed them my paperwork.  "This is Mr. Nox Sétanta.  He will be staying with a while.  And this is his friend Dorian Vega.  Mr. Vega needs to be added to the guest list for Nox.  He'll sign the needed paperwork and then you can show him to Nox's room.  He's been given family access."

Family access... I liked that.  They hadn't even asked.  Had Dorian.  But from the questioning look he gave me he hadn't either.  I shrugged and he smiled.  "I'll see you in a few.  I'll take care of this and see you soon."

I nodded but it wasn't like I had a choice Madison pushed me through another set of double doors.  "This is the common room.  You'll spend a good deal of your time here with the others.  It's breakfast time right now so no one is in here."  Madison pointed through another set of double doors.  "In there is the dinning room.  We'll show you that at lunch."  She pushed me through another set of double doors that lead into another hall.  "These are the rooms.  All rooms have windows and cameras with mics so we can hear you.  There is an intercom system if you need something.  Doors are key carded from the outside.  And unlocked during free time so you have access to your rooms if necessary."

We past mostly open doors inside of one I saw a man who's fire element was scattering everywhere, I knew a fire would start shortly and as we passed two doors down the fire alarm went off.  I nodded to myself and found the familiar sound of the blasts almost comforting.  "I can help him."

Madison asked, "What was that?"

"The man they were trying to sedate before he got angry enough to start a fire.  I an help him."

Madison shook her whole body when she spoke, "They've tried everything.  He can't learn, the mental capacity is not there."

I grinned at her.  "I can teach a three year old control I'm sure I can show him what he needs to keep his lid on."

Madison stopped in front of a room that looked very much like the others except the window was large, the door was locked and closed.  She waved her card over the locking mechanism.  "Because you submitted freely we can allow you access to other rooms, but when you aren't with the others you will be in your room with the door locked.  Your visitors will sit with you in here under observation."   She pointed to the three cameras that covered every corner and nook of the room.  "This is Sucicide Watch Level 1."

She sighed, "There are three level.  The next has no windows and really nothing in the room.  The last is complete isolation in a padded room.  I hope you never see the insides of that room."

"I'm not suicidal.  I haven't tried to hurt myself since I was 7." I said with fustration.

"Do you want me to help you out of the chair?  Or do you want to wait for Dorian?"

I shrugged, "The bed is probably more comfortable.  How long can Dorian stay?"

"Today he can stay until visiting hours are over.  They start in two hours and last for three.  That should be enough time to get you settled in."  Madison smiled.  "You really like him don't you?  I don't think I've ever seen you smile that much."

"I do.  Surprises me just as much as anyone else."

Madison helped me stand up and I tried not to put too much weight on her but she was Venatori and a lot stronger than she looked, she helped me with no problem.  By the time Dorian's shadow graced my doorway I was in bed and Madison had set up the table with food.  I was hungry still.

Dorian shook his head.  "I don't think he's ever going to stop eating."

Madison laughed.  "That's a good thing right now.  Today he's on bed rest, tomorrow we will try to get him up and moving and into physical therapy.  He'll need more food during that time I suspect as well.  Nox, I'll have the meal planner sent your way so you can set that up."

"I already gave them that.  Dr. Silverman gave me his unchanged list and I left it at the ront desk with the rest of his paperwork."  Dorian smiled. 

"Seriously, he's that predictable?"

I laughed.  "I've been eating near the same thing for most of my life Madision."

"Alright.  I'll be back in a few hours.  If you need anything there is a button on the bed and one by the door you can use to talk to us.  If you need to use the restroom we will need to have a male nurse go with you."

"I know the drill.  I've been here before."  I sighed and started eating the spread that was laid out in front of me.

Dorian sat down on the bed facing me and dropped another bag in my lap.  "It's all approved.  I figured you could use some distraction."

"A present for me?"  I grinned at him.  Inside the brown paper bag with handles was a composition notebook with blank pages.  "They wouldn't let your usual notebook in - the metal spiral was a danger."  The next thing I pulled out was a box of crayons.  I laughed but Dorian frowned, "They would only allow crayons.  No pencil pens or other implements of that nature."

I grinned at Dorian.  "No this is fine.  I can work with it."

There were several paper back books inside, I didn't recognize the titles, "I figured you could do with a little bit of mind stimulation as well."

I smiled at Dorian.  "Thank you.  What would you like me to draw?"

"Whatever you usually draw."  Dorian said with a smile.

"My drawings are of my nightmares, that's what the journal you must have found was.  Or you'd not know I like to draw."

Dorian blushed.  "I wasn't going to say anything.  I didn't look at much of it.  I liked the last image in the book though."

I smiled.  "Me too.  What would you like me to draw?"

"Whatever Nox.  I figured it could help you pass the time."

"You are no help.  I don't want to draw my nightmares with color.  I guess I'll figure it out."  Dorian just smiled at me.  

I sighed.  "You don't have to stay with me.  This is going to get boring rather fast."

Dorian nodded.  "I know.  But I like seeing you awake.  I can try another session if you'd like."

"Not today.  You nearly passed out.  We don't need you in here too."

Dorian laughed, "That could be interesting."

I raised an eye brow at him and pushed the table to the side and beckoned Dorian to come closer.  He did by scooting up still facing me.  I hurt bending forward but Dorian pushed me backwards and readjusted.  He sat on my lap which was only slightly more comfortable with his weight on my legs. But when he kissed me I forgot all about the discomfort and the pain. Electricity ran through my body when his lips touched mine.  He tasted of wine.  
Dorian's hand lifted my shirt and he touched skin underneath.  I could feel the feather light touches tugging at things much lower.  I let out a soft moan and Dorian smiled through the kiss.  He pulled back and I whispered, "We should stop."

Dorian nodded.  "When you are ready."

I grinned at him.  "We have an audience and I hurt."

"An excuse but don't worry about it Nox."

"You are really waiting on me?"  I asked Dorian.

"This means more to you than me.  I'm not saying I don't care or that you feel more than I do.  But sex for you meant something different.  Yes?"

I nodded.  "You've been talking with Margo or Jace."

"Both actually."  Dorian paused only breifly to touch my cheek and down my neck with his hand and I leaned into his gentle touch.  "I wanted to understand things so I didn't make you feel more at odds with your life.  Dr. Silverman was glad to have me come talk to her, but she said she couldn't tell me specifics.  Not without your written conscent.  Jason forged that consent however without my knowledge, apparently something the two of you did often."

I nodded.  "I don't mind.  Dr. Silverman didn't think you would and filed it with your records before handing me a copy of them.  Everything."

"Everything?"  I grinned, "So you've read her notes after I set Garrett on fire, and after my suicide attempt.  After Dylan beat the shit out of me and after I saved you?"

"Among other things.  Why do you mention those particular times?"  Dorian asked much like Margo would have.

"Because those are the major events that shaped my life.  There are others there as well.  Like the man going to jail, but I don't think Margo knew about it precisely.  She didn't like hearing about my sex life.  That was someone elses department."

Dorian nodded.  "I've his notes too."

"You do?"  I was shocked.

"Do you want me to read them?"  Dorian asked.  "I haven't touched them yet.  We hadn't discussed the situation so I wasn't sure if it was knowledge you wanted me to have."

"You can read anything about me Dorian.  I'm not shocked you have them, I'm shocked that he gave them to Margo after I left the Academy."

"You've not see him since then?"

I shook my head.  "I stopped seeing him when I was 16.  He told me he's taught me all he could and that I was capable of handling my own self in all possible encounters."

"What did he teach you?"

I smiled at Dorian.  "He taught me to control myself, my fears, my anxieties in situations where I lost control.  I met Adrian after Tim went to jail.  I was trying to fill the whole he'd created, Adrian knew I was underage but still he was game if I was.  He pinned me to the wall much like you did the other day but instead of telling him I didn't want to do that I froze, I became obideinet and complient.  I couldn't say no even if I wanted to.  Garrett had beaten it out of me.  That particular situation was beyond my control."

"Adrian stopped then and released me from my prone position and let me free of that fear with a simple 'I can help you.'"  I paused to take in Dorian's expression. "He taught me other words to say no, because I couldn't do it.  It took a while, but I found the safe words worked for me.  He taught me how to be in control whether I was on bottom or top."

I didn't have anything else to add to what Adrian meant to me.  He wasn't a lover, but he was a mentor of sorts.  We sat in silence for a while before Dorian asked, "Did you ever sleep with him?"

I nodded.  "Yes, a few times, but I was 16.  It was more of a final test than anything."  I added, "When I was 13 sex was just a tool to get people to be close to me - to hurt me without having to hurt me.  After Adrian sex was enjoyable.  I still used it to cope and push people away.  But I was in control of it.  It was like learning how to jump off a building.  It was freeing.  Without it I wouldn't be here.  I wouldn't be able to even think about more with anyone and certainly not you."

"Why not me specifically?"  Dorian asked.

I smiled weakly at him, "Because my feelings are so strong for you that I would have hurt you the most because you could hurt me the most."  I leaned back against the bed and stared up at the camera watching us.  "I have wanted you since we were kids.  Saving you was one of my better days.  The feel of your hand in mine when you helped me up.  The way you looked soaked in mud and grime it still tugs deep down inside.  I'd forgotten how I felt about you until I saw you when I came out of the elevator.  And everytime you kiss me or touch me now I can't help but want to have more of it."

Dorian's hands reached around my neck and he pulled me forward and kissed me.  My heart raced and my body ached for him.  When he pulled away he smiled.  "I will do my best not to hurt you, Nox.  I can't promise you I will succeed because relationships aren't something I'm good at.  And certainly, I'm not good at being in this place in a relationship where I have never been before either."

I smiled, "We'll learn together."## Little Blue Pills

I ate more than my fill and there was still enough food for later. Dorian even ate some.  I was tired but I didn't want to sleep while I only had a few hours of time to spend with Dorian.  Which he convinced me I had to do my hair.  He trimmed it carefully.  I didn't like being the complete center of his focus but then I didn't want it anywhere else either.  It felt strange having Dorian fussing over me like a child.  It took all my effort not to feel like I needed to smart off to him or to be rebelious against his instructions.  

His fingers in my hair made me shiver.  And then when he started filling in the dark color at the roots of my hair I felt even more awkward.  I had never liked going to a hairdresser for things like this - something I could easily do myself, but when I tried to do it myself against Dorian's instructions I found my arms hurting.  Physical Therapy was going to hurt big time - even more so than the burn.  I didn't think anything could be worse than that.  Now I know better.

Dorian was careful with the tips as well he said I couldn't see the color he'd chosen to dye my hair.  I was a little worried.  I wasn't fond of bright colors and prayed he didn't choose one.  While we waited I drew and Dorian watched me.  I felt even more childish as I sat with crayons and paper sketching out patterns before I set to sketching out him.  He was staring at me I could repay the favor.  He had only grinned at me as I'd flipped the page and started.

But the crayon's weren't working well so I flipped the page and conjoured up a pencil from nothing.  Dorian laughed.  "If I'd know you could do that I'd not have brought crayons."

I grinned.  "Crayon's don't work well when you need to erase things. And besides I like crayons."

Dorian sat up and watched as I started sketching his profile on the page.  "What else can you conjour up like that?"

I looked up at him.  "Anything I've studied the pattern of.  Any object with no mechanical parts.  I can conjour the parts but not moving ones all at the same time.  So things like guns I can't do, but the trigger, or the hammer and all the small peices together but it wouldn't be perfect and I wouldn't want to fire it."

"Anything living?"  Dorian asked.

I shook my head and set the paper and pencil aside.  "You know you can't create living things."

Dorian smiled, "And before the other day I thought healing was impossible."

"It is in the sense that you are healing them.  You aren't healing someone.  You are providing extra resources so the body can heal itself.  I don't expect you could do the same thing with a human who heals slowly."

"So tell me the mechanics then."

I nodded.  "There really isn't much to it.  There are technically five elements."

"That is new."

I smiled.  "The fifth element isn't bendable.  It exists between all patterns living or not.  If you were to zoom into the spaces between a pattern you could see little sparks.  Those sparks can be coased into things, like healing.  But you can't make it do anything, bend it to your will.  It's like an willful child and disobedient.  It has a mind of it's own.  Some scientists might call it the god particle.  It is the essense of everything living.  It sparks and transmits life.  You fuel a body with these life particles and the elements of the universe.  Together in unison they can heal a repairing body.  You can't replicate something from a once living thing, but you can from a living one, like cutting off a leaf and allowing it to take root.  You can dulpicate a plant because that is how it works in nature.  Our cells don't work like that on a large scale.  Could it be possible to clone a human from a cut off finger, or a peice of hair, maybe with years of study on the subject in genetics and dna and the patterns of life, but one without the other is doing to not work."

"Most of what I do is pure chemistry and physics.  I learned the basics in school and it lead me into different studies once I realized that the laws and such were very similar."

Dorian was wide eyed and listening carefully to every word I said.  "If I can get you a laptop can you write it all down?  Everything that's in your genius head?"

I shrugged.  "If you want me to, but I'm no genius.  Just a kid who plays with patterns."

Dorian stood up and started taking the headgear off.  His internal clock must have told him it was done, because we didn't set a timer for it.  I didn't even have my phone because I could use it to hurt myself.  I doubted they would let me have my laptop, maybe under supervision.

I closed my eyes and let Dorian finish his task.  I enjoyed his touch this time more than the last.  I was getting used to his care.  

When he was done he ran a comb through the top and styled it how he liked.  I didn't normally do anything other than run my fingers through it.  He helped me stand up and look at my reflection in the window.  Dorian had chosen a saphire blue color to highlight the tips of my hair, there were still stands of red running everywhere.  I grinned at him as he helped me sit back down in the bed.

He glanced down at his watch.  "I should get going.  I don't want to make them mad at me on the first day."

I nodded.  "Okay.  Thank you Dorian."  I paused, "For everything."

Dorian stood over me with a smile.  "Anytime love."  He leaned down and kissed me tenderly before he nicked the pencil and tapped it against my head.  "No more pencils I don't want you to get in trouble."

"Yes, sir," I said with a smile.  

He kissed my forehead and headed for the door.  "Tomorrow I will see about pooling our resources again.  I will eat well and sleep well tonight to insure that I'm well rested."

"Okay."

Dorian left just as Madison was opening the door.  Dorian let her in the stepped out.  She smiled.  "I was just coming to tell you visiting hours were over, and dinner will be served soon if you'd like to join the other residents."

I shrugged, "Why not?  I'm not sure I can walk that far today."

She smiled and flicked her purple locks from her face.  "We'll get a wheel chair for now.  Until you can move freely."

I sighed.  "I suppose."  

Madison pulled the wheelchair in from the hall and helped me get in the contraption and pushed me towards the dining hall.  She asked, "Did you have a good time with Dorian?"

She flicked a stray hair back into place.  I grinned.  "I always have a good time with Dorian."

"I assumed you have him naked and breathless when I walked in.  Didn't even look like you two were more than friends.  So not the Nox I remember."

"We all grow up sometimes."  I said flatly.

The dinning room was larger than I thought it would be.  It was full of people considered mentally unhealthy for whatever reason.  I could see several Magnus in the place, and a few other supernatural beings but what I saw more than not was Tacet.  They made me shiver, the fact that they had their givtl purged from their souls left mine aching in return.  To not have my ability would be a fate worse than death.  I wouldn't be me, and I was sure that they weren't who they had once been.

Madison rolled me up to a table.  "This will be your table from here on out."  She pointed to a little girl with blond braids and said, "This is Lori.  The girl next to Lori sat slightly taller than the blonde.   Her name was Jo and I could tell she was a were, but she was different than others I'd seen like she wasn't fully formed.

Madison pointed to a very large black man, "This is Julian."  He gave her a dirty look.  "He likes to be called Duke though."  She leaned forward and whispered, "And I'd call him that no matter what."

The final person who came later than I did Madison introduced, "This is Cliff", Madison hesitated and pointed to the empty chair next to him, "And this is Ameilia."

Ameilia's chair was sitting next to me so I offered her my hand and mimed shaking it and pulling it to my lips with a kiss.  "A pleasure Ameilia."  The look on Cliff's face made him light up.  I had acknowledged his friend.  

Madison just shook her head and muttered, "Always a flirt."  Her voice rose to include everyone, "This is Nox.  He'll be staying with us for a while."

Lori giggled.  "He likes Ameilia."

I smiled.  "I like everyone."

An orderly with a cart full of pills placed labeled pill cups in front of everyone and I looked down at the pill with two little blue pills in them and frowned.  "What's this?"

Madison leaned in a whispered.  "Everyone takes something.  It's an inclusion thing to help those who have to.  It's a sugar pill if you aren't on anything."

I nodded.  "Down the hatch."  I swallowed the pills without water.  They had an aftertaste that I didn't particularly like.  I decided water was best suited for the task next time.  

Food arrived under covered trays and everyone waited until everyone was served.  My stomach rumbled at the sudden sight of food.  It ached; I ached.  

The last plate was served and everyone in near unison was uncovering their plates.  Lori looked at my plate and laughed.  "You can have anything you want next time."

I grinned.  "This is what I want."  

Lori laughed.  "You ar weird.  What happened to you?"

"What do you mean?"  I asked.

"The wheel chair, or do you not walk ever?  You don't look frail like the others who are chair bound."

"Ah.  I shattered the bones in my body catching a bad guy.  They think I did it to kill myself.  Thus why I'm here."

The little wolf spoke softly, "Suicide watch sucks.  I'm surprised they let you have a knife, or anything sharp at all."

"Voluntary admission.  Suppose to help.  This is not the first time, nor the last, I'm sure."

The little blond twirled her hair as she poked at the pancakes with strawberry's on top with her fork.  She didn't look hungry, or act hungry but I was famished and hadn't realized that I'd finished most of the vegetables on my plate as we spoke.

Cliff interrupted.  "Ameilia says that you are cute."

I grinned at the man, "Of course I am.  But thank you Ameilia I appreciate it coming from someone so lovely herself."

Cliff blushed and hid himself behind his hands as he ate.  

Jo growled and rolled her eyes.  "You know she's not real right?"

I shrugged.  "She's real to Cliff.  We all see things a little differently.  Maybe Cliff here is seeing a ghost of some lost soul who doesn't want to move on.  Yeah it could be in his head, but I know things in my head are real."  I sighed as I finished the last bite on my plate and my stomach rumbled again as if I'd not eaten at all.

Lori giggled and handed me her plate.  I looked at it with disdain but I ate it anyway.  I was going to pay for this later.  I could feel the carbs sitting on my hips.  Duke laughed, "He's eating like a horse.  How do you stay so thin?"

"I don't normally eat this much, but my body needs healing fuel.  I did a number on myself before the jump, now it's worse."  I said and I hoped that's all it was.  My body just healing I didn't want to keep eating this much forever.  I felt like the Flash in the comics always hungry and always eating.## The Little Werewolf

Lunch, dinner, whatever it was was over sooner rather than later and Duke rolled me into the common area with the rest of their group.  He said as he pushed me, "We have arts and crafts today."

"Just like Kindergarden," I joked and the big black man chuckled and I could feel it reverberate in the chair itself.  I was impressed with the man's lung capacity and his sear strength.  It made me wonder why he was here, or why any of them where.  Cliff clearly was seeing things that made people think he was crazy.  I didn't think he was crazy.  But I couldn't prove it, and I wasn't a pschologist.

He pushed me up to a table with a bunch of art supplies, no scissors I noted as I pulled a blank peice of paper over.  Lori sat down next to me and Jo next to her.  The two men took up places at the easel's to paint something.  Nox had never given it a shot, he prefered drawing, it came naturally to him.

I started doodling things I saw around the room.  Lori's hand next to mine, the pattern around Jo, the objects across the room.  It wasn't much just simple sketches.  Jo commented as she glanced at my paper. "You are pretty good."  He hand reached across Lori and put her finger on the sketch of her pattern and asked, "What's this?"

I grinned.  "You."  

"I take that back you are a horrible artist."

I laughed as I sketched her into the blank spaces where her features would go, her hair, the way she was pouting as she watched me finish the drawing.  "It's how I see you, more or less.  The way the patterns move around you."

"I don't get it."

Lori giggled, "He's a Magnus.  He can bend an element."

"Actually I can bend all the elements."  I held my hands in front of me and four balls of identical size and shape formed above my hands.  I'd done it so often as of late that the particular trick was becoming instanteous.  "At the same time."

Lori's mouth feel open in the shape of an O. "He's Cesari."  She snuggled up against my arm and patted it.  "I'm in love."

I laughed as a voice behind me said, "Well that was fast."  I turned to see Madison sitting down on the opposite side of me.  "What will Dorian think?"

I grinned at her.  "Flirting?  I honestly don't know.  He's not said anything yet and I've flirted with several people in front of him."

Lori asked, "Who's Dorian?"

I smiled but Madison answered before I could say anything, "His boyfriend."

I'd have denied it except it had been the precise thing I was going to say.  Though it wouldn't have come out like, you are wasting your time with him, he's gay.

I expected Lori to pull away and pout but she didn't she curled up closer, "I'll love him from afar then."

I laughed again, "Yeah, that's real far away."

She poked me in the ribs and I jerked away too fast hurting my already soure self.  I sighed.  "Be nice."

Lori poked me again and I dropped the ball of water on her head.  "I said be nice."

She pouted now.  Jo laughed. "I like him."

Madison smiled and leaned in to whisper to me.  "I put you in the right place."

I asked, "How so?"

She nodded towards the girls, "They haven't been overly open with anyone we've put to the group.  Cliff and Duke were here before them, and they are like father figures to the girls.  These two are very quiet."

I grined.  "I bring out the best in everyone."

Madison rolled her eyes.  "Alright.  You girls take care of Nox here. But don't get drawn in by this pretty face like I did."

"Oooooh," Lori said.  "You two know each other?"

I nodded. "She was my first."

"Your first what?" Jo asked.

"The first person I slept with - male or female".  It was the truth I spoke there wasn't any point in lying but Madion smacked me in the arm.  "Ho that hurt.  I'm not lying."

Madison rolled her eyes.  "Its for saying it so loud."

Lori asked innocently, "Was he your first?"

The question turned Madison's face the color of the rose pinned to her shirt. She muttered something as she left.  So I answered the question. "No.  I was a pitty..." fuck is what I wanted to say but I opted not to finish the sentence at all let them imply what they wanted.  "I was a too skinny kid who had problems and I was fawning over the same guy she was crushing on at the time.  It was a one off thing.  We never really talked much after that."

Jo asked, "But I thought you liked guys?"

"Why does it seem to be one or the other with most people.  I grinned at the two girls, "I enjoy sex no matter who it's with."

Jo whispered, "But you like one more than the other?"

I shrugged.  "If you made me choose, yeah probably."

Lori laughed, "So choose."

I sighed, "Fine.  If I had to choose one or the other it would at this moment be men.  I like men."

Jo whined, "Why?"

I laughed, "I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you."

Duke laughed behind me.  "Don't get any ideas magic boy."

I turned around and felt my muscle strain with that effor to look at Duke behind me.  "I won't, big man.  I'm firmly in play with someone else."

Cliff added from behind his own canvas, "Ameilia is dissapointed."

"Ah, she can come over anytime Cliff - anytime."

A bell rang and everyone scattered, I caught Jo's arm before she passed me completely.  "Can you take me to my room?"  Jo looked around and saw that the room was empty and sighed.  I asked, "Have you changed yet?"

"What?" Jo asked.

I put my hands on the wheels and stopped us, I grabbed her hand and pulled her so I could look at her, she came hesitantly.  "I know you are a were, have you changed?"

"I don't understand."

I sighed.  "Take me my room, can you stay and talk?"

"Yeah I guess.  Curfew isn't for a few more hours."  Jo wheeled me to my room.

She pushed the door open and pushed me through.  "By the bed please?" I asked.  I didn't think I needed help to move if I was close enough.

Jo obliged me and I lifted myself and literally fell on to the bed with an amazing sprawl.  It hurt so bad.  I tried to pull at my power to heal myself a little but I couldn't hold the stream for long, it was sapping my strength. "This so sucks."

Jo sat down in the chair by the wall.  It was bolted in not that it would matter if I really wanted to get violent.  I was suprised I wasn't in a fire-starter room.  I know they had them, I'd been in one before when I was 6.  I pushed those thoughts away and looked across at the brunette staring at me.  

"So what did you want?"

I nodded.  "Tell me how you came to be here?"

"Why?"  Jo sighed, "Oh never mind, I'll tell you.  I came her because a man dropped me off here after he caught me because I had a violent episode - rage induced something or other they said in a store and I hurt some people pretty badly."

I asked, "Was it anywhere near the full moon?"

"How would I know?"  She was about to leave, she was getting up annoyed at my questions.

"Please don't go.  Really I'm just trying to help?  Were you ever bittien by a dog or a wild creature?"

"Yeah.  About two years ago, my parents were killed by the pack of wolves that attacked us.  I was in a foster home until that man told them i would be better of here."

I nodded.  "So you don't know you are a werewolf then?"

"What?"  She didn't beleive me, the sound of her voice was telling me that.  "There are no such thing as werewolves or vampires."

"And there is no such thing as magic."  I could barely muster up a fireworks show from nothing.  She didn't looked impressed, but then I'd done the same earlier.

"It's all just a trick."

"Actually it's all very real.  I'm a Magnus.  You are a werewolf.  Most of the people here aren't overly special except they are Venatori not human.  There are a few exceptions like yourself."

"I don't believe you."  She rolled her eyes and walked out of the room leaving me to my self in the darkness of my room.## Dreaming of Dorian

I laid down on my new bed and found it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.  It wasn't a cot so it really was better than what I slept on while out in the field.  My body hurt.  My stomach ached with hunger pains but the left over food Dorian and Mia had brought me was on the other side of the room and I didn't feel like calling a nurse in so I could eat yet again.

I closed my eyes and thought about the one person who had made my day today - Dorian.  Not only had he spent a majority of his day with me, he was intersted in thing I said.  Not that I didn't like listening to my own voice, but no one really ever listened when I said anything.  I was just that obnoxious kid who happened to be Cesari.  Everything else I was only detracted from me.  I was nothing amongst the Venatori.

I drifted to sleep with Dorian heavy on my mind.  The darkness overcame me as usual.  But it wasn't filled with the glowing eyes.  It was a happy scene - me and Dorian close, very close together our bodies interwined as much as humanly possible.  It felt good to be close to him - to someone who wanted more than just sex.

The darkness drifted in again on wisps and soft breezes until there was nothing left of the happy scene.  The glowing eyes grew and I fell into the darkness alone and afraid.  A meancing laugh echoed in the darkness.  Fire light everywhere surrounding me.  The glow of the fire made the shadows move.  I saw figures in front of me and I started awake the moment I saw the demon tentacles had embraced Dorian around the neck and he was limp like a rag doll.

My heart was pounding and my body was covered in sweat.  This was the first time my dreams had centered around hurting someone else.  I could hardly breathe.  

This was not how I had envisioned my life, dreaming of my own pain and suffering I was used to but now, it threatened Dorian.  I wanted to call him, but I didn't have my phone, which also meant I had no idea how long I'd slept.  I just knew it was dark and everything was quiet around me.  

So I got up and started doing push ups and sit ups and other things to keep my mind occupied, it hurt like hell, but the counting always helped. It was why it was a usualy go to when I couldn't sleep.  Some people thought I pushed myself too hard, but it really was a coping mechanism.  And tonight was no different.

Except this time it did little to calm my anxiety.  I tried to take deep breaths but I couldn't even focus on that through the pain.  I ended up sitting at the table in my room with a floating ball of light above my head as I sketched my nightmares on the notepad Dorian had brought for me.  It was probably the most detailed drawing I'd ever done for a dream.  The details screamed at me in my head, I couldn't shake them even as they were recorded on the paper in crayon.  

I didn't so much as feel the sun on my back but I could tell the sun had risen as things started to move outside my locked bedroom door.  A familiar beep sounded and Madison walked into my room and stopped just inside with the wheelchair she'd brought with her.  "What are you doing out of bed?"

I flipped the notebook closed and sighed.  "Nightmares."  She pushed the chair towards me and I stood up.  "I'll walk."  I could feel the pain in my legs radiate through my body as Madison frowned at me.

"No you won't."

"Yes I will."  I put my hand on the door frame and started walking towards the cafetria area.  "I won't be helpless anymore."

"Nox, you'll hurt yourself worse."  She hurried up with the chair still in front of her.  "Nox.  Sit down."

I shook my head and kept walking one foot in front of the other.  I made it to the table I was assigned and sat down.  My heart was racing, and my body ached from the exertion and I collapsed in the chair.  Madsion frowned at me as she left shaking her head.  

"You look tired."  The big black man sitting next to me said.

I grinned at him.  "Between nightmares and walking here I'm not so much tired as I hurt."

"Well why did you walk you idiot?"  Lori asked.

"Because I'm stubborn that way."  We were still waiting for Jo and Cliff and Ameilia to show up so I decided to fill the silence. "When are visiting hours?"

Lori giggled, "Why you expecting someone?"

I gave her my brightest smile, "Of course I am.  I'm popular.  And I was really hoping to get some from Dorian."  Which was not exactly a lie, but Lori turned the color a beat.  I hoped Dorian did as promised and slept and ate well, I could really use the help, I didn't want to walk anymore like this, but I didn't want to be pushed around either.  It was a no-win situation.

I looked at Duke and winked; he moved his chair away from me a few inches and his voice rumbled, "Don't get any ideas."

I laughed.  "I could show you a thing or two."

Jo took that moment to sit down with a curious look on her face.  "Do you flirt with everyone?"

I nodded.  "I try to.  But see that wasn't flirting, that was making my main man Duke here uncomfortable since he found my having sex with men uncomfortable.  It's a habit."  I turned to the big black man and smiled. "I'm sorry.  I will attempt behave myself."

Duke grumbled something that sounded like don't worry about it but it didn't really matter.  Cliff joined us and I offered my hand to Ameilia and brought it to my lips, "A pleasure as always Ameilia."

Lori giggled and Jo rolled her eyes.  Duke was the only one to comment, "You shouldn't realy encourage him."

I smiled.  "I encourage everyone to live their lives the way they wish to.  And since you don't particularly enjoy my advances at least someone else does."  I wanted to stick my tongue out at the big man but he rolled his eyes and me and I afraid he might actually try to hurt me.  

The medicine carts rolled through and everyone swallowed their pills.  I still felt wrong doing it.  I didn't need meds.  I hated faking it.

Breakfast arrived, a perfectly cooked frata that had Jo and Lori oggling and this time I did stick out my tongue at them.  "Mine."  I covered my plate with my arms and grinned at them.  Jo pouted until I offered her a fork full of my food which she took  delicately with her fingers and pulled it off my fork before tossing it in her mouth.  Lori pouted and I handed her a peice too. They both looked at me with delight.

I took a bit and found it passable, not the best I'd had.  "I make better."

Both of the girls eyes shot open, and Jo asked, "You cook?"

I nodded and waved my hands over my body, "You think a bod like this comes from eating fried food and grease laden cafeteria food?"

Both girls burned a light shade of pink before they settled into eating their own food.  I finished mine in three more bites and was still starving.  This was not good.  I was still draining too many resources.  I could barely move, my ability was scant.  I wasn't like it at all.  I disliked being disconnected from who I was.

Madison interrupted our breakfast, "Nox, Dorian is here.  He's in  your room waiting.  He said he didn't have long."

I nodded.  "I'll get there on my own."

Madison only shook her head.  "Bull headed boy still."

I grinned at her.  "Yup."  I turned to my table with a wicked grin.  "I'm off to see the wizard."  And I got up slowly and walked - rather I hobbled to my room.  It didn't take me as long to get back as it had to get there, the food supplying much needed energy.

I stood in the doorway while Dorian was staring at the drawing I'd been working on.  "Hey you."  I smiled.

Dorian looked at me with a frown and flipped the notebook closed.  He took me by the arm and sat me down on the bed with a furious glance.  "Why are you up?"

"Because I can't stand being wheeled around."  I said flatly.  "You aren't even going to ask what that was in the journal?"

"I presumed a nightmare.  Am I wrong?"  Dorian said with confidence.

"No.  But it's not my normal nightmare.  I don't normally dream about you like that."  I grinned at him as he helped me lie down.  There were very few rods exchanged as I saw Dorian start practicing the patterns need to heal me and he set to work.

I could feel the pain of the bones healing, and the muscled strengthing.  It was crude and painful and I wanted to scream but I didn't, I didn't want Dorian to stop.  When he did it was like a crushing weight had been lifted from my entire body but I sat up without help and only a small twinge of pain.

Dorian looked a little tired.  "I'm sorry that it saps so much strength."

Dorian grinned at me and put his hand on my knee closest to him. "It's okay.  You needed it.  You already look better.  I'm only glad to help."  He stood up and offered me a hand to stand which I took gratefully but not because I needed the help but because I wanted to touch him.  He pulled me close, "You dream about me?"

I bit my bottom lip and lowered my eyes and nodded.  Playing coy wasn't a usual thing for me but with Dorian it happened without a thought.  "It's mostly day dreams, last night was the first dream and it turned horrible.  I wanted to talk to you so badly last night but I don't have a phone."

Dorian sighed, "I'm sorry."

I grinned up at him.  "It's not your fault.  I'll learn to deal with it.  I'm not used to worrying about someone else like that."

Dorian smiled, "Now you know how I feel."  He pressed his lips softly against mine, it was a just a small kiss before he pulled away.  "I have to do alot of catch up from yesterday.  I will stop by for lunch.  I already made sure that was alright."

I nodded.  "Okay."  I caught his hand as he turned to walk away.  He looked back at me.  "Thank you Dorian."

He kissed me again softly this time there was a lot more behind it but it was still too short.  But a throat cleared in the hall and Dorian smiled as he pulled away.  "I'll see you at lunch."

Jo stood in the doorway and stepped aside as Dorian left.  "He's cute."

I sat down on the bed and waved her in, "He's more than cute Duckling."  Jo sat down next to me on the bed which was a bit of a surprise, "What's up?"

## Father and Sons

Jo stared off at the wall in front of her before she finally said something.  "I'm sorry about last night."

I shrugged and leaned back against my bed, my head resting against the wall.  "No worries.  Finding out you are a werewolf is kinda a shocker to anyone.  I take it you've not turned yet."

Jo shook her head.  "Our were professor says it happens at different ages for different creatures, but a werewolf in their early twenties.  You shouldn't be in here you should be with a pack."

Jo was pale and staring straight ahead.  I wasn't sure she was even listening to me.  "I might know an alpha who can help you.  Though he's not part of a pack.  And fledgling wolves do better in packs.  If you were a tiger you'd probably be alright with finding another to teach you as they are solitary creatures even out in the wild."

Jo turned and looked at me, "You sure know alot about werewolves for being ... what did Lori call you?"

"Magnus.  Cesari specifically.  But I'm Venatori - well half anyway.  It's my job to know about the supernatural races.  I can't exactly hunt them if I don't know anything about them can I?"

I didn't think Jo could get any lighter but she did, all color washed from her as she whispred, "You hunt us?"  Her eyes grew angry and hateful, "Do you kill us too?"

I shook my head.  "I try not.  But I'm rare in that department.  I've killed those that attacked me.  But I tend to capture and let there be a trial."

Jo leaned back like I was and curled against my side which I thought was odd, but I didn't object.  She whispered, "You smell like a forest."

I grinned, "That's a new one.  Usually I smell like a campfire."

I feel Jo taking a deep breath against my skin with a soft nod, "That too."

There was a soft knock on my door and Jo sat bold upright and scurried out the door before I even had time to tell her it was alright.  I watched her hurry past my father who was staring at me in wonderment.  "Does Dorian know?"

"Does he know what?"  I asked.

Kai nodded after Jo, "The girl scurrying away from your bed."

I shrugged.  "I wasn't doing anything."

Kai only nodded and pulled the chair to the side.  "You look better.  Dorian told me you could move today?"

I nodded.  "Since when do you talk to Dorian about my well-being?"

"Since he spent nearly every night sleeping in a chair by your bed while you were unconsious."  He smiled at me.  "Don't hurt him, or I'll Emilio have you."

I grinned at my father.  "I have no intentions of hurting Dorian, Dad.  I like Dorian."

"Dad?"  Kai asked with a smile.

"It felt right."

He stood up and offered me a hand, "Let's go to the gym, get you back in shape.  I'll take it easy on you."

I took his hand and we walked to what the ward called their gym.  It was mostly cardio equipment, but there was an area where it looked like yoga or other cardio classes too place - there was not a weight in sight.  I sighed.  Kai only laughed.  "Sparring?"

I nodded, "Alright."

I took my socks and shoes off and stretched a little while my father watched me.  "You are moving stiffly, a little more stretching than usual."

I nodded and continued with what I'd been doing, I agreed with him.

I could feel the ache in my muscles despite the healing Dorian had done.  I still could barely touch my gift, but at least I could move more freely without too much pain.  

I stood up and took a fighting stance and my father followed suit.  He grinned at me, "No cheating."

I stuck my tongue out at him.  "I can't touch my ability which puts me at a disadvantage."

Kai smiled, "I'll go easy on ya.  This time."  

But I knew better than that, his easy wasn't going to be the same as my easy and he proved that point when he threw the first punch which I blocked and I felt the bruise blooming on my forearm.  My father was full Venatori which meant super human strength to my normal strength.  But I reached for my ability and cased myself in air.  My father frowned.  "That is not fair.  I thought you said..."

I smiled.  "I'm not going to walk around looking like you beat me up.  I can't do much more than this though."

He nodded, "Fair enough."

We danced around each other gauging the other's speed and ferocity before my father let loose.  He jabbed me in the stomach and smacked me upside the head twice but I got in a few good licks before he held up his hands breathing heavy.  I bent over to catch my breath as my father patted my back.  "Well done, and for being injured I'm impressed."

That was high praise coming from my father.  He sat down and stretched again.  I followed suit, there was no need to hurt myself further.  He looked over at me, "That girl.  Who is she?"

"Jo?  She's a werewolf - though she didn't know that before yesterday when I told her."

"She looks familiar."  Kai mumbled to himself as he popped the water bottle he had with him and handed it to me.

We didn't speak much more until we were in the hall and heading back to my room.  I needed a shower.  "How are prospects coming?"

I frowned at him not knowing what he was talking about, he added, "The Dowager girl and several others had appoints with you before all this happened."

"Ah."  I shook my head.  "Reschedule them I guess, they can come visit me here.  Same with all those other people who wanted to talk to me."

Kai nodded, "Would you like me to do that for you?"

I shrugged, "Dae'lin usually handles it but that's up to you.  I've limited time here and Dorian gets first dibs."

"You really are serious about him?"  He shook his head.  "I find it very hard to believe that two of my sons like the same sex."

I smiled at my father.  "I like women too, unlike Nick."

"I know but that doesn't make it any better.  I wonder where I failed."

"You didn't fail either of us.  You had no chance with me and Nick just likes guys nothing you could have done either way.  I like Dorian a lot.  I get he's a family friend, but to me, he's just a kid I want to school with and had a crush on.  I wasn't part of the Viddens Vega family relationship until now.  I'm not going to hurt your best friends son on purpose.  Dorian's a good man."

Kai laughed, "I never saw you for the settle down type."

"I want a family.  A big happy family one day.  I doubt it'll be traditional since I'm not exactly follow the rules sort of guy."  I opened the door to my bedroom.  "I need a shower, Dad.  Come by again and we can do it again."

Kai nodded.  "That sounds like a plan.  I'll schedule that in too."

I grinned.  "You are getting the idea."

Kai shook my hand and I stepped into my room to grab a change of clothes before heading down to the showers.## Confessions

My days in the ward drew closer together, I forgot from one day to the next what day of the week it was.  Everything was perfectly scheduled, it was probably the most at peace I'd been in the past ten years.  I knew exactly where I was supposed to be and when.  

I had lunch daily with Dorian and sparred every other with my father.  I met with Margo once a week, and Dr. Wilton everyday for 30 minutes or so.  I even met with Dr. Eriksen about things she wanted to know about - mostly me and how was doing, but she asked some very weird questions.  Things like how I was feeling that day, if I felt sorer than usual even though I'd been doing better.  Dorian had even stopped giving me his energy.  Of course it had been at my prompting.  I could touch my ability again and do drips and drabs to continue the healing process.

I hung out more with Jo and Lori than with anyone else at our table.  I think Cliff was stepping back because he had a crush on me and Duke was afraid I had a crush on him.  Neither of them really paying any attention to the fact that I was completely smitten with Dorian.  So much so that both Lori and Jo commented on it nearly everyday.

I also had a few conversations with women who supposedly wanted Cesari children.  Anabel Dowager had come one day handing me a slip of paper with scheduled times over the past few months.  She said we'd plan specifics once I was released.  She also informed me that her mother was pushing for a much earlier release.  Which I wasn't going to argue for.  The more people on my side the better my chances of getting out of this joint were.

The large girl from the cafeteria had also come to see me, her name was Amanda Brighton and she did want what everyone else wanted.  I turned her down, but not because of her looks because she expected that I would enjoy a foul mouth on a woman.  I don't mind dirty talk in the bedroom but before we get there it's a bit much.  I think my reputation had preceded me with her.  I didn't remember her being part of my crowd, but then very people were ever part of my crowd.  Though the rumors were always pretty bad anyway.

Today I had a meeting with Dr. Eriksen about my health.  I wasn't looking forward to it.  After than I hoped I could get Margo to get me out of here, but she wasn't officially my pschyologist at the moment so I'd requested Dr. Wilton's presence as well.  

My meetings with the docotors were after lunch and I was looking forward to spending time with Dorian.  He'd come everyday for the past few weeks as I sat in this place doing absolutely nothing.  He always gave me something to draw while he was gone, so I had a notebook full of things I'd drawn at his request along with my recurring nightmares.

Dorian sat at my little desk flipping through the latest drawings and back to other drawings he'd asked me to draw.  I could see the wheels turning as he searched through the pages for something.  I was tired of him being so far away so I went to him and put my hands on his shoulders and looked over his head at what he was looking for.  There was a momentary stiffening as I touched him, but he relaxed into my hands quickly enough.  This was still a very public location for Dorian even though it was currently my bedroom.

Dorian flipped between two drawings, one more recent than the other and back to one I'd done earlier in the week.  He asked, "These aren't the same, but they feel the same."  He commented.

I took the notebook from him and carefully cut both pages out and laid them down on the desk for him to compare.  He looked up at me like I'd ruined something.  I grinned at him.  "I can fix it."

I put them back in their places and essentiall glued them back together with fibers made from my own creation.  He shook his head.  "Do you use your abiltiy for everything?"

I nodded and winked at him, "Not everything.  Though that could be interesting.  A few extra hands and appendages could come in useful."

Dorian blushed knowing exactly what I was talking about.  I handed him the papers again and he set them down and examined them.  "These?  What are they?"

Dorian pointed at the shining stars between the patterns.  "Life."  I said simply.  

"That's how you see it?"

I nodded.  "If I look close enough, yes."

He blinked at me and then wove a pattern of pure air in front of him and I could tell he was focusing hard on the pattern.  "It's always there?"

"Always."

Dorian sat there staring at his own creation until a slow smiled spread on his face.  "But you can't manipulate it?"

He looked up at me with curiousity and eagerness.  He enjoyed learning new things, and this he was in heaven.  He'd asked me the same questions over and over again but he never quite beleived.  I nodded at him. "You cannot manipulate life."

He sat studing different weaves he could create, he was becoming rather adept at it without any formal training.  I wondered if he tried to test himself in the wee hours of the night when no one was in the testing rooms.  I doubted Dorian really cared for all his research into things.  I kneeded his shoulders as they grew tense with concentration.  I felt him relax into my fingers and groan softly as I worked the knots in his shoulders.  

Dorian grabbed a hand and pulled me around in front of him and down into his lap.  I sat in stunned silence as his fingers played with the belto loops of my jeans.  I looked down at him bitting my bottom lip wondering what he had in mind.  I could feel his body react to being this close to me and I responded in kind.  We still hadn't done more than pretend we were teenagers making out on my bed - all hands and lips over skin and not much below the belt.  And I really didn't expect more with cameras in the room.  But that didn't stop my body from wanting so much more.

"Don't do that."  Dorian's hand rose from my hip to my lip and ran his finger over my bottom lip until I released it.  

I leaned forward and pressed my forehead to his and whispered, "But you like it."

Dorian pulled my chin down and kissed me deeply as he stood up.  I gasped into his mouth and I had little time to protest the maneuver as he carried me with Venatori speed to the bed and had me lying on my back with his body over mine.  I didn't have time to fight the panic attack before Dorian's mouth envolped my entire consioucness.  There was nothing but he and I.

And as always when we got going, hands and lips someone opened the door with a studdering, "Oh, I'm sorry."

Dorian looked up and rolled his eyes.  "It's not like it's the first time Madison dear.  You've walked in on everyday this week." Dorian was sitting up and straightening his shirt that I'd pulled out of his pants to get to his skin underneath.  "I suppose that means Dr. Silverman is here with Dr. Wilton?"

Madison nodded, "They are early."

Dorian leaned over and kissed me fully on the lips and pulled away breathless then whispered, "Dream about me tonight."  He got up and headed for the door.  He smiled at Madison, "We should start charging."

Madison blushed as Dorian walked out the door closing slowly behind him.

I didn't bother with straigthening myself as Dorian had.  I didn't really care what Margo or Leroy saw.  Madison walked beside me to the small room used for pshcye consults.  She stopped at the door and smiled, "He's more braizen each day."

I laughed, "I think it's more to do with need rather than actually changing."

"Meaning?"

I leaned over and whispered to Madison, "He wants me that bad.  And he knows it's mutual and we've yet to actually **do** anything about it."

She blushed as I opened the door.  "Knock next time."

Madison nodded and I entered the small room where my two lovely therapist sat.

Margo sat in a folding chair while Dr. Wilton sat in the plush one leaving me with the stupid couch.  I hated the couch.  I sat down and smiled at my long time therapist.  "How goes it?"

She smiled at me as she always did.  "I'm fine.  Did we interrupt something?"

I grinned at her.  "I don't kiss and tell."

Dr. Wilton cleared his throat.  "You know that is a lie.  In saying it you imply what you were doing."

"If you are implying we were kissing I will say yes to that.  But if you want more details too bad."

The man pushed his glasses up as they slid down his pointed little nose.  "And if it were part of your recovery you'd be required to tell me, but your love affair with Mr. Vega is not any of our business.  Shall we?"

I sighed.  "Fine.  What is on today's agenda?  Am I still suidical?  Nope.  Am I going to jump off building for the hell of it?  Yep.  Am I trying to kill mysel? Nope.  And anything I'm leaving out?"

Dr. Wilton jotted down my answers and sighed.  "Why do you insist on jumping from the building?"

"Because I can.  Because it feels good to fall for those 8 seconds it takes me.  I trust my ability."

"But you just recently got that power back after taxing yourself too hard.  It could fail you in the middle of the jump."  He honestly sounded concerned for my well being.

"And do you not drive a car because it could blow up any second?  Or fly in a plane because it will crash into the ocean drowning you?  Do you stop eating because you could choke on your unchewed bite or swallow a bone that could peirce through your larnyx?  No you don't because the probability is slim and you trust in it.  I trust my ability.  I trust myself implicity.  I will not jump if I feel weak.  I will not use my ability unless I know I can fully function.  I am not an idiot.  I value my life more than I value most things."

Margo whispered, "Except maybe Dorian's life."

I grinned at her.  "Yes.  I value Dorian's life above my own.  I would do anything to keep him alive.  Anything!"

Dr. Wilton.  "Mr. Setanta..."

The door opened and Dr. Eriksen poked her strawberry blonde head into the room.  "I'd like to speak to all of you together if I might."

Dr. Wilton waved her in and gave her the cushy chair and unfolded another folding chair in the corner.  The room just got a whole lot smaller with little miss doctor with chaotic patterns.

The doctor sat down and I averted my eyes from her I felt like I was going to vomit her pattern was chaotic and I could not make it go away because it was too strong.

"You're healing power is exemplary Mr. Setanta."  Dr. Eriksen said as if it were something she was proud of.

"Nox.  And I didn't do most of it."

"Then who did?"

I shrugged.  

"Who did Nox?"  She repeated herself.  I didn't answer.  I kept looking at the floor.  "Why won't you look at me?"

I grinned.  "Because you make me sick." 

The room grew quiet and I laughed.  "What I mean to say is.  The pattern around you makes me sick to my stomach.  I can't look at you without seeing it."

"I am not Magnus."  She sounded like she believed what she said.

"Whatever you say Duckling.  You are untrained and Eruditus, but you are Cesari."

Margo leaned forward, "Cesari can never be learned, Nox."

"Why not?  Dorian is close, I feel it.  I see it."  I nodded towards Dr. Eriksen, "And she is one.  There is no doubt in my mind."

"And by the way if you hadn't figure it out yet, Dorian is the one who helped me heal fast.  Until recently touching the elements has been rather painful for me.  Without Dorian I would still be in need of a bed and a wheelchair."  I kept my eyes averted the whole time we'd been speaking.  I could tell Margo was annoyed.

Dr. Wilton made a suggestion, "Can you help her with the chaotic pattern then?"

I shrugged, "If she's willing to try."

I made four balls of elements above my hands.  "Draw a colored line in  your mind from you to the ball.  You have to see it in  your head, not just say it's done.  You have to beleive it's done."

I watched from hooded eyelids and saw that her pattern was calming down.  I turned my face up to look at her directly and smiled.  "See was that hard?"

Dr. Eriksen frowned, "That could have all be a ploy."

I shrugged, "Whatever.  I don't typically lie inside these walls."

Margo nodded her agreement, "He's right, he may not give you the full truth, but he rarely lies.

I didn't care what she thought.  I rarely cared what anyone else thought anyway, why should this woman be any different.  I looked at her with indifference.  "You wanted to tell us something."

She nodded.  "I have a confession to make.  There were multiple reasons you have been placed here.  You are a danger to yourself, but we needed more time to explain what happened to you."

Dr. Eriksen took out her notes.  "When you first came to me you were on the verge of dying, every bone broken, internal injuries so severe we didn't want to operate.  But with in days you were better.  Still in a coma, but you were healing impossible wounds."

I just stared at her waiting for the ball to drop, there was some sort of catch.

There was a slight flush in the woman before me as she continued.  "The pills you have been taking have been a very specific poison."

Dr. Wilton stared at her with a slack jaw and I could see Margo ready to say something.  I stood up and reached for the door then looked at Margo.  "You will get me out of here, now."  I turned to the woman before me.  "If you don't allow Margo to sign me out of here, I will leave.  And there is nothing you can do to stop me.  I am not some guinea pig you can run experiments on.  I will see your liscense abolished."

I opened the door and slammed it behind me.  I heard a painting crash to the floor but I didn't stop walking.## One Last Night

I walked the cooridors of the pschye ward for about an hour before I found myself walking past a room just as a peircing scream let lose and a large crash followed by a scrambling orderly running out of the room.  I caught the door before it latched closed and found Jo cowering in a corner.

A voice came over the intercom, "Nox, you need to get out of there, it's not safe."

I looked up at the camera and shook my head.  "She can't hurt me.  I'm at full capacity."

"Don't be an idiot.  Get out of there."

"Sorry, can't do that."  Nox threw a wall of air in front of the door and it wouldn't open no matter how hard they tried to shove things around.

There was low rumble coming from the corner of the room where Jo huddled against herself.  I sat down in the middle of the floor and just sat there watching the small girl turn her snarling face my direction.  Her eyes had gone amber and her lip quivered as she growled.  "How has no one understood what was going on?"  It baffled me what Venatori went through to be ignorant of things.  This was clearly a case of werewolf close to the full moon.  Anger and agression, even her eyes changed colors.  People really didn't pay any attention in their classes.

I don't know how much time passed before I moved a little closer.  Jo had stopped rumbling until I'd done that.  I wove a shield of air around my body, so close it almost hurt.  I didn't want to put up a wall and hurt her but I didn't want her to bite me either.  Venatori die when bitten, it's worse than not surviving the disease.  It was like lycanthropy was designed to kill Venatori.  And I wouldn't put past whatever created us to do just that - we were immortal once.

I moved closer to Jo whenever she calmed down and understood I wasn't going to hurt her.  I don't know how long I sat there on the cold cement floor.  My legs were going numb but I was with in arms reach of her.  I reached out and touched a lock of hair that had fallen in front of her now amber eyes.  She sniffed at my hand much like a dog did and nuzzled it softly.  That was a good sign.

I moved closer and removed the barrier from my body.  I could easily defend myself but I wanted her close.  I pulled her against me and leaned against the wall.  

I could feel the sun go down and when the moon rose Jo started to whimper.  It woke me from the shallow sleep I'd drifted into.  Surprised to have driftec I was awake as I heard the first cry of pain from the girl in my lap.  I held her close as her body quaked and quivered against me.  I watched as her body transformed underneath my arms, her back arching against me and she turned over in my lap on all fours.  Her face against my neck and I started to feel panicked.  My heart started to race as the change continued.  

I don't know how long it took it felt endless as I held her and told her was going to be alright until she was lying in a large brindle fur coated wolf on my legs pressing her head against my chest.  I kissed the top of her head and she sat back and howled at the moon.

There was an howl outside the window of another's call and another.  She returned their cry and began to dance around.  She needed to hunt, but that wasn't going to happen in here.  I got up in her bed and pulled her with me, she struggled and I could feel an eager energy about her and I could see it wafting in waves around her.  I reached out and touched the patterns around her and she looked at me with curiousity in those amber eyes.  

Jo, the wolf, climbed into her bed and curled up next to me and put her head on my shoulder.  I sat there with a large wolf leaning on me until we drifted off to sleep.

I woke from a nightmare of wolves hunting my demon and ending up dead themselves.  Jo lay curled up naked laying her head on my legs.  The sun was streaming through her window up on high and I touched her shoulder tenatively.  She stirred and scrambled away from me clutching at her sheets.

I held up my hands to say I surrender, but she blushed and hurried towards her dresser gathering up clothes and tried to get out of her room.  I'd forgotten the barrier on the door and she stared at it with confusion.  "Sorry."  I removed it.  "You can go through now."

She turned with the pale sheet wrapped around her, "What happened?"

I grinned at her.  "You transformed last night."

She asked, "Why aren't you dead? Or am I not?"

"I don't know really but you trusted me, I guess."  I smiled at her.  "Things should go better now, Jo."  I stood up and straightened out my shirt and jeans before stepping up to the little wolf girl with a grin.  "I will speak with the local pack and try to find you a home here in the city.  You don't need these walls, you need a pack."

Jo still didn't look like she believed me but I'd met enough werewolves to know that a pack can do you a lot of good - much better than the mental hospital that has no idea what they are handling.

I stepped into the hall and Madison was rushing my way.  She hurried Jo into the bathroom and guided me away from her room.  "Nox, that could have gone very badly."

"I told you she wouldn't hurt me."  I walked where she guided me which was back to my room.

We stood outside my open door.  "Why were you so confident?"

"Because I'm a cocky bastard?"  I gave her that look that said I beleived it, and in a way I did.  "Because I knew she couldn't.  I'm not your run of the mill Venatori.  I could have locked my self behind walls of air, like I kept everyone out all night long even in my sleep.  But I knew she wouldn't hurt me."

"But you didn't know."  Madison sounded exasperated.  "You have a visitor."

I raised my eyebrow and stepped inside my room and grinned.  "Well Hello you." 

I heard Madison stomping off the other direction and I laughed.  Dorian smiled at  me as he turned around.  "What was she mad at?"

I grinned playfully at Dorian.  "I spent the night with a girl."

He arched an eyebrow and I laughed.  "The little werewolf transformed last night.  I kept her from hurting anyone or herself."

I saw Dorian relax as I told him about Jo.  He really had thought ... "You really thought I'd sleep with someone else?"  I closed the distance between us and stood as close to Dorian as possible.  

There was a momentary frown before Dorian spoke, "It's not as if you are the mangomous type."

I asked, "Is that what you want?"  I added, "With me?"

Dorian took a deep breath and stepped back.  "I don't know Nox.  I like this."  He waved his hands between the two of us and I smiled but I didn't say anything I'd let him continue.  "But you aren't exactly the most reliable partner.  So many hurt girls and boys from  your past and those are only the ones that were here in the Academy."

I nodded.  "You ever think it was because I hadn't found the right partner?"  I wanted to touch Dorian, but I held my ground.  "Look Dorian.  I know my past is a lot to take in, but I have no intentions of hurting you."  Dorian looked like he wanted to say something but I held up my finger asking him to wait while I finished. "I do not intend to sleep around, or tarnish your image, or anything else that might hurt you.  But I'm fallable, I will fuck up.  I do better with rules.  If there are things about my lifestyle that bother you, you need to speak up so I can adjust before they become too much."

I held my hand out palm facing up and nodded giving him the chance to talk and Dorian smiled.  "I don't know what's going to turn out to be too much Nox.  Never dated a guy like you."

I grinned at him.  "I'm improbable."  I took a step to close the distance between us but not so close I would impose upon Dorian this time like I had last time.  "If you don't know then I'll ask some questions now."  Dorian nodded.  "Do you want me to stop flirting with guys?"

He gave a slight nod and my heart sank, "Is that flirting in general or just guys?"

Dorian backed up and sat down on my bed.  "Nox.  You would stop being you to please me?"

I stood in the middle of my room and nodded, "If it bothers you that much yes."  I stepped up to Dorian and squatte down in front of him taking his hands in mine.  "I will do my best to not flirt with people.  It will be hard."

Dorian shook his head.  "I won't change a fundamental peice of your persona, that's not fair."  He smiled, "But keep the physical flirting to a minimum."

I grinned, "I will touch no one but you in any flirting manner.  I can handle that."

Dorian pulled me close and I fell to my knees and he leaned down and kissed me.  We hadn't even got started when someone cleared their throat behind me.  I knew who it was just from the singular sound.  She'd done it often enough when I was a child.  "Hi Dae'lin."

I stood up and turned around.  She handed me several folders and an envelope.  "Work for the next few weeks while you remain out of field duty.  The envelope containes your release instructions.  First and foremost, Dorian is to escort you to Dr. Silverman's office for your release consultation and go over those contents."

I nodded.  "Alright."

Dae'lin smiled past me.  "Nice seeing you Dorian."  She grinned then back at Dorian.  "You could do better than this Dorian."

Dorian chuckled.  "I'm not sure about that, Dae'lin.  He's quite the catch from what I've seen.  Even your neice seems interested."

I turned around and gave Dorian an incredulous look.  He really said that.  He really told Dae'lin that Daneilla had flirted with me.

Dae'lin sighed, "Nothing new.  She seems to have a thing for men who are so not what she needs."

"Her friend seemed to just want sex.  I hope she's careful."

Dorian stood up and wrapped his arm around me.  "Yeah she slapped him for his comment."

"Do I want to know what it was?"  Dae'lin asked.

Dorian shook his head.  "No, you don't."  

Dorian picked up my bag and handed it to me.  "Shall we leave this dreadful place?"

I nodded.  As we walked out Dae'lin joined us and I asked, "Can you get me the number for the local were wolf pack leaders here in the city?  I need to contact them.  I can call a friend, while he's an alpha he's not exactly in a pack."

Dae'lin nodded.  "I'll email the list to you."

We stopped at the front desk while Dae'lin kept on going.  I was handed yet another stack of papers to carry out.  Which Dorian took from my hands  so he could hold my hand as we exited the phschye ward and headed to Margo's office a few floors down.## You Did What?

We had to wait for Margo's current appointment to finish so Dorian and I sat in her office waiting room.  It as always was filled with the soft comforting scent of apples.  I leaned against Dorian taking in both comforting scents and closed my eyes while we waited.  Dorian shifted and I sat forward and looked at him.  He seemed to be thinking about something.

"Penny for your thoughts?"  I asked him.

Dorian looked at me from the back of the couch and gave me a weak smile.  "Last night I had a visitor."

"What kind of visitor?"

Dorian frowned.  "My son."

My jaw dropped in surprise.  I didn't have a problem with Dorian having a past, but I hadn't know he'd slept with at least one woman.  

"It's not like what you are thinking."

"You didn't sleep with a woman and get her pregnant?"  I grinned, "Cause that's what I'm thinking.  I don't care if you have kids Dorian.  I'm just shocked to find out the completey gay man I'm with has slept with a woman."

"Is everything a joke to you?"  Dorian frowned.  "Sorry.  The whole thing is a big mess.  My parents were badgering me about my obligations.  I went to Denver, a place I didn't really know anyone and I experimented."

I grinned at him but I kept my mouth shut.  I didn't want Dorian to think I found it slightly amusing that way he was phrasing things.  He rolled his eyes, "Just say it."

"Well apparently your experiment was successful.  How long were you with her?"

"Three months.  I broke it off because it was getting serious, and I couldn't love her.  She was a sweet girl.  The day I broke it off she was going to tell me I was pregnant but I told her I liked men and she didn't tell me what she was going to.  Her mother called me later to yell at me about leaving her daughter with an unborn baby."

Dorian was distant and I saw a lingering fear in his eyes.  "She was human."

I frowned and was going to say something but Dorian continued.  "She had the baby.  They are both healthy, but that also means that he's Magnus.  It's the only possible solution to her problem.  100T of human female women who give birth to Minorem have been Magnus."

"I am aware of the improbability of his birth."

Dorian nodded.  "She lost her job a few weeks back.  I've arranged for her to come here for a job interview that she is guaranteed so her son can learn here."

"So what's your son like?" I asked.

Dorian shrugged.  "He's 4.  He likes Cars - as in the movie.  I think we watched it twice while he was at my house."

"Does he know who you are?"

"Stella wants to wait to tell him."  Dorian said flatly.

"Wait, is his name Aidan?"  I asked.

"Yeah.  How did you know that?"  Dorian asked confused.

"I met them on my flight in.  Stella gave me a ride here because Jace forgot about me.  I went up to her apartment."

Dorian's face grew angry and I held up my hands.  "I didn't sleep with her - honest.  She wanted to.  We talked on the plane, she found out a little of my history, figured I was a good pony to start her engines on again - after you apparently.  I can't say I was all that happy to find out some Venatori prick had left her."

"I didn't know."

I patted Dorian's knee. "I understand.  Really that my gut reaction.  I shouldn't have phrased it that way."

Dorian sighed.  "I was some prick.  I was screwing around with a human girl with full knowledge that things could happen.  Inexperience.  Not exactly something I typically have to deal with ya know."

I laughed, "Yeah hard to get a guy pregnant.  Though you'd be rich if you could."

Dorian rolled his eys.  "So you aren't angry?"

"That you have a son?"

"Any of it?"  Dorian asked.

"I see the dilemia.  I see both sides, but honestly Dorian I don't care about your past.  I can't be a dick about it and expect you not to g, but honestly Dorian I don't care about your past.  I can't be a dick about it and expect you not to be a dick about mine.  Mine is far worse than your's is."

"I could have killed her."

I nodded.  "Yeah but you didn't.  That's what I was upset about with her on the plane.  I couldn't imagine anyone doing that, but she didn't tell you so you couldn't warn her, or be there for her.  You are stepping up now though aren't you?"

Dorian nodded. "I'm gonna try."

"You'll be great."  I heard the door open and a man walk out of Margo's office and she waved me inside.  I took Dorian's hand and pulled him with me as I walked into her office.  Margo raised an eyebrow.  "I need to add to those papers."

Margo nodded.  "I'll have Megan print them out and we'll get them signed before we begin."

I sat down on the couch and Dorian sat down next to me as Margo stepped into the lobby to speak with Megan.  Dorian asked me, "Why am I in here?  And what papers?"

I smiled.  "Because I have no secrets to hide from you.  And the papers will allow you and Margo to discuss my sessions outside my presence.  I figure if you have questions, you might as well get the whole truth.  This is more than a conference."

Dorian was nodding as Margo set papers down in front of me and I sighed my name and wrote Dorian's name in the space provided.

Margo sat across from me, "Dorian do you understand the confidentiality of the agreement Nox is signing?"

"Not really.  First I've heard of it."

Margo nodded and leaned forward with her elbow on her knee that was crossed over the other leg.  "Usually these papers are reserved for individuals who are guardians or in the need to know - spouses, parents, and legal guardians.  Nox has one agreement in place for Dae'lin.  He's adding you to the list of people whom I can contact if I need to verify that he is doing well.  And you may contact me if you have any questions."

"Okay.  I only have one question."  He turned to look at me, "Why?"

"I told you why.  I'm not going to keep secrets from you.  Today, my past, my current situation on any given day."

"So why not just tell me?"  Dorian asked.

"Because I may not know what you want to know.  These sessions just aren't about my curent situation, they are my whole life.  Dealing with things as they come is part of it, but sometimes we talk about other things - like my mother or father.  About my need to push people away.  I want you to have an open line of communitcation with Margo if you think I'm hiding something from you or you feel I've not elaborated enough on.""

Dorian nodded.  "Okay.  But I want you to talk to me too.  That okay?"

I nodded in agreement.  "This isn't a substitute for that.  I promise."

Margo smiled, "Is this settled?"

We nodded.  Margo smiled.  "Good.  Now to the contents of your discharge."  Dorian handed her the envelope but she shook her head,"I have a copy".  

"Dr. Eriksen confession has been brought to the Infirmary board and she would have been put on displanry probation if it were not for her brother who explained her actions as proof of your immortality."

"My what?"

"Your healing ability prompted further testing of the pill they gave you.  It was a fast acting poison and even in your dimished state you healed."

"So she poisoned me to say I'm immortal.  It was specific to Venatori and kills humans instantly and Venatori with in a few hours.  So yes, you were taking it for two weeks three times a day."

"I'm still going to have her medical liscense revoked.  I'm not a guinea pig."

Dorian interrupted.  "You mean to say Nox's doctors have been poisoning him?"

Margo nodded.  "Under Venatori law the gentics research is legitmate, legal action can't be taken.  It's part of the Clandestine Providence to enhance our race to be the best it can be."

"So I"m fucked?"

Margo sighed.  "Your claim would be unfounded yes."

Dorian shook his head.  "So what are the terms of his discharge then?"

"Weekly meetings with Dr. Wilton until he clears Nox's mental stability and in that time he will also clear him for active field duty.  Monthly meetings with Dr. Eriksen which may include blood work, dna samples.  And change in your obligation to the breeding program.  As you are Minorem you were required two.  They are asking a minimum of two but would prefer it be as many as you can conceive naturally."

"And if the amount I can conceive is less than two?"  I grinned.

Margo shook her head, "that is something you should take up with your father.  He can go over those particular details better.  He can probably help you arrange them as well."

"I'm not in need of finding any women to sleep with.  The problem becomes my current relationship.  Not exactly going to produce children here."

Margo nodded.  "I understand that.  You two will need to work on your obligations.  The rules are the rules, Nox and you know this."

"You know I've never liked rules."  I sighed, "Anything else?"

She shook her head.  "No.  But the roof is off limits."

I sighed.  "Fine.  Can I go now?"

Margo nodded and offered Dorian her hand.  "Dorian, I look forward to helping you understand this crazy one."  She patted my knee with her other hand and I stuck my tongue out at her.

"I will see you boy's later.  Oh Nox, your father left me something to give you."  She picked up a set of keys on her desk.  "Your new place.  Status increase thanks to your paper, a few medics reports and your new found immortality."  

I took the keys from Margo and sighed.  "I guess nearly dying had some positive effects."

Dorian opened the door and put his hand on my waist as I passed in front of him.  I smiled at Megan.  "Same time Monday?" I asked.

She nodded. "Yep.  9:30am still on the books Nox."

"See ya next Monday then."

We left the Infirmary levels and headed for my new digs.## Dinner with Dorian

We took the stairs.  I stopped on the landing where my new room was and opened the door for Dorian.  I grinned at him.  "I can open doors for you too."

He winked at me and made me walk through before him, one hand on the door the other at my waist.  "I like treating you Nox."

I smiled.  "Stay the night?"

Dorian didn't say anything as we walked to my door and I had unlocked it.  Dorian smiled at me then said, "I have a few things to do.  Dinner?  And then we'll see where it goes?"

I nodded with my back to my new door.  "I'll cook for you."  I turned and opened my door and found that even in the dim light from the hall my apartment was completely empty and I sighed.  I turned around and Dorian was watching me.  I grinned. "It's empty.  Your place then? I'll cook."

Dorian nodded. "That sounds good."  He pinned me against the door jam and kissed me.  I felt every nerve in my body ignite and Dorian leaned into me.  A small moan escaped from my lips and Dorian chuckled between kisses.  Dorian pulled away a little.  "7pm."

I kissed him softly and nodded.  "7."

Dorian pulled away completly and walked down the hall to do whatever he had to do.  I went into my room with my things and the folders and flipped on the lights.  But they didn't work.  There was a bit of work to do on this place and I wasn't really in the mood, so I changed into running clothes and went for a run.

My run started out uneventful, but as I started back into the AU building I had a strang feeling I was being followed.  I turned and looked around but I saw nothing out of the ordinary, but a long time ago I learned to trust that feeling. 
Though there was nothing I could do out in the mundane world, where humans lived.  So I went inside and took the stairs up.  That usually discouraged would be followers - it was a lot of stairs.  As I stepped inside I felt the feeling again and as I turned around I saw him.

I took a deep breath but I was frozen in fear as I stared at the man who had tormented my childhood.  Garrett smiled at me.  He started weaving patterns of air around him in great tentacles that would lash out at me in my dreams.  I closed my eyes unable to move or do anything else.  

I waited...

But nothing came and I ventured to open my eyes to find nothing at all before me.  This was getting bad.  Really bad.  I hadn't had waking nightmares since I was 7.  I ran up the stairs to my new empty apartment.  It was still early yet.  Not even noon time, but my stomach wasn't hungry, I could barely think about food.

But I had shopping to do both for my apartment and for dinner that night.  It wasn't Sunday, I don't think it was anyway, I'd lost track of all time and really didn't have any bearings in those terms.  But I wanted to impress Dorian and my favorite show-off meal was steak.  So steak it was.

Shopping was boring.  I saved the groceries for last and hoped that the fridgragor in my room actually worked until 7 when I could go to Dorian's.

I purchased the basics - bed, linens, pillows a couch, a set of chairs and a table and cleaning supplies.  I wasn't a neat freak but I needed to clean the staleness out of the room.  Maybe with daylight bulbs and clean floors and walls I'd feel better.  

I set an alarm for 6 so I could shower and get ready for my date with Dorian and then I split my time between projects - cleaning and the folders Dae'lin had given me.  One assignment wasn't really her juristriction - but she'd given the Academy permission to use my services.  It seems they wanted me to teach little kids to use their power.  Stating they were showing early signs and that they couldn't teach them the regular way.

Apparently my paper and lecture had gone over well. 

My alarm chimed and I switched it off and I could feel my pulse start racing in my ears.  Nerves?  Really?  It's not like this was a new phenomenon - getting ready to go out.  But it was new - I liked Dorian.  No I more than liked him.  I wanted him, needed him.  I could almost go so far as to say I loved him, I was definiately nearing that in love stage and the only reason I could tell that was because I was nervous.  

My hands were shaking while I tried to trim my goatee.  I gave up. Last thing i wanted was to hurt myself or to have to shave it all off to begin with.  After my shower I spiked my hair and remembered how Dorian had colored the ends himself.  I was a multicolored porcipine.  Though they weren't standing straight up and they'd fall down quickly enough the way I was sweating.

If I hadn't known Dorian enjoyed my typical style I would have gone more somber, but he'd done my make up for me after I'd gotten out of the hospital.  I wouldn't hide from him.  I knew who I was.  And the makeup wasn't required to be me, but it certainly gave me the confidence to pull through the anxiety.  That was part of the reason I'd started doing it in the first place.

I didn't wear jeans and a t-shirt like I usually would have.  I wanted to impress Dorian.  It was also a new feeling.  I still wore jeans, but they didn't have holes in them and weren't my typical faded blue - black went better this time, and I work a black button up with half the buttons done up with a orange t-shirt underneath.  

When I was satisfied I was presentable which I didn't - I considered changing and removing everything including the hair color but a glance at the time changed my mind again - I grabbed my groceries and headed to Dorian's apartment.  I had to look it up, I didn't remember exactly how to get there, but I managed to be on time.  I knocked on his door at precisely 7pm.

I heard footsteps falling and someone open the door.  But it wasn't Dorian.  I knew I had the right place but the man standing in a pinstrip suit with no shoes on was definitely not Dorian.  Though I did remember him from the Academy.  He greeted me with a smile.  "You must be Nox."

"I am.  Is Dorian home?"  I asked mildly.  My anxiety was through the roof and I could feel my heart in my throat and my palms were sweating.

"He's getting ready.  I'll go check on him."

"We are staying in as far as I'm aware."  

The man looked at me and nodded.  "Yes, I'm aware.  Come on in.  Kitchens..."

I sighed, "I know where it is."

He headed back to Dorian's room and I didn't even hear him knock, but I heard their conversation even though it wasn't very loud.  "Your boy-toy is here, Dorian."  There was a slight hint of laughter in his voice.

"He's not my boy-toy."  Dorian said flatly

The other man giggled.  "He's hot.  Though the hair and the make-up so very retro of him to continue the same style as he did back then."

I rolled my eyes and started taking things out of the bags and looking around Dorian's kitchen to find the equipment I needed.  It wasn't long before Dorian appeared and the man with no shoes was no longer shoeless.  "Dorian, I'll see you round."  He grinned at me.  "I'm Todd, Dorian's best friend.  I'll catch you round too I imagine."  Todd offered me his hand.

I beamed at him as I took it gently in my hand and lifted it to my lips for a tender kiss.  "A pleasure."  The look on Todd's face spoke volumes but I couldn't exactly interpret it - he was either highly pleased or completely taken back.  Either way I'd done my best to  set him off his game.

Todd turned to Dorian and they exchanged a look before Todd was turning on his heals and heading out the door.  "Another day, boys."

I grinned at Dorian as Todd left and he was shaking his head at me.  "You flirt with everyone."  Dorian closed the distance between us and wrapped his arms around my waist.  

"He did say I was hot."

Dorian laughed as he kissed my neck, "What else did you hear?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing."  Dorian's mouth caressed my neck and when he bit softly a s mall sound escaped my throat and Dorian chuckled against it.  "I need to cook."

Dorian pulled away to look me in the eyes, "I can think of other things we could be doing."

I laughed as I pulled out of Dorian's strong arms, he didn't fight me too bad as I did it.  I started working on cutting vegetables as Dorian rounded the bar and sat down.  "We have plenty of time for that."  I winked at Dorian.  "But I need to eat."

Dorian watched me as I made dinner.  Though he did busy himself with setting the table and pouring wine.  He handed me a fluted wine glass and smiled at me.  "Todd, thinks your style is a bit retro.  Things you did when you were younger."  

I grinned at him, "I heard that too."

Dorian nodded.  "I didn't have the heart to tell him, that I liked it.  You aren't afraid to be you."

"Who else can I be?  I mean do you want to see the frightened child?  Not that you haven't already but that's not awe inspiring or attractive."

Dorian walked set down his glass and took mine from me and turned me around to face him.  "There is nothing unattractive about you, Nox."  He rans his fingers down my back, caressing the scars that he knew lay underneath my shirts.  "I want to see all of you."

I kissed him softly and turned around to finish cooking the steaks that were  making Dorian's aparment smell even better than it already did.  Dorian started to move away but I caught his hands and pulled them back against me.  He held me while I finished cooking.  "You can have it all Dorian."  I whispered.

I turned off the burner and stepped away from the stove then wrapped my arms around Dorian as I turned in his arms.  "We can eat now."  I kissed him softly.  My body tightened as he ran his fingers along the top of my jeans under my shirt.  "Food, first."  I nipped at his neck and up to his ear and whispered, "Then more of this.  Please?"  I could hear the pleading in my voice.

Dorian pulled away taking me by the hand and grabbed a plate I'd dished out and I took the other one as Dorian lead me to the table and we sat down to eat.  We chatted about many things, but mostly about what I would be doing for the Academy.  As Dorian was one of the lead testers, he wanted to use my expertise and change the testing, but that required a lot of working together and training which I was the only one at the moment who knew how.

He also told me about the kids in the class I was teaching.  Aidan was one of them, to Stella's knowledge Aidan was a normal child, but Dorian had already seen signs of his abilities and had arranged to have him in this starting level class/day care instructor.  There were four other children.  One Dorian said I might remember - a half dragon whom I'd rescued as a baby from his parents.  His parents were dead now and he was under Venatori care as half human dragons were slaughtered by their kin.  He had no where else to go.  There were three other children, one of which was deaf and a twin, and another very shy and quiet boy.  All whom I got to meet the next day at my first lesson to which I was not prepared.

When we were done, Dorian got up to clean the dishes and I shook my head.  "I got it.  I made the mess."

Dorian shrugged.  "I like watching you."

It made me grin as I cleared the table and Dorian moved with his glass of wine to the bar to watch me clean his kitchen and the dishes.  I hurried but not too fast.  My heart was already racing at the prospect of spending intatate time alone with Dorian.  I wanted to touch him so badly.  I wanted to feel his body against mine and I jumped when Dorian slipped his arms around me as I dried the last dish and put it away in the capbinet above me.  

I could feel his need against my backside.  I felt the heat of his breath against my neck.  My pulse quickened as I turned around and he pushed me against the sink.  He grinned at me and brushed his lips against mine lightly before he put them against my neck and I felt my knees buckle but Dorian caught my weight and I shifted to stand alone, but Dorian's body was pinning me in that awkward position.  I didn't care, there was nothing more that I wanted than to have him touching me.

I hadn't really paid much attention to what Dorian was wearing when I walked in.  His tyical button down with long sleeves soon became a nusiance as I untucked it from his pants to get to his skin underneath.  His skin was warm under my cold finger and Dorian flinched a little and chuckled against my neck before he bit sharply.  I tried to speak, but it stuttered as Dorian sucked on my adam's apple as he switched to the other side of my neck.  "We should probably go someplace a little less dangerous."

Dorian didn't stop what he was doing he grabbed me by the belt loops of my jeans and backed up.  We ran into the bar once, and another wall before reaching Dorian's bedroom door which he backed up against and I was pressing his body against the closed door.  Dorian pulled my chin down with one hand and reached for the door behind him with the other and opened slowly kissing me deeply as we stepped into the darkned room.  

The door closed behind us and Dorian turned me around and backed me up against the bed and pushed me backwards once my legs hit the end of the bed.  I obliged him and awkwardly moved back as Dorian climbed on top of me his legs astride mine.  He sat on my midsection and ran his fingers under my shirt and started pushing both of them over my head.  His fingers tickling my sides as he pulled it over my heads and freeing my head but left the them binding my arms above my head.  I laughed softly as he kissed my lips and moved to kiss me else where.  

He sat up and all I saw was the lust in his eyes as he pulled his own shirt over his head.  I wanted to touch him but he looked like he was enjoying the fact that I'd stayed in the position he'd left my arms without having to ask.  I asked in all seriousness.  "Do you remember the safe words?"

Dorian nodded and leaned down and kissed my neck and then to my ear he whispered the safe words and their instructions while he bit and licked and sucked on my ear.  I managed to get say, "Good" before he was kissing me deeply and his fingers were undoing the button on my jeans.  My heart fluttered and the gentle touch of Dorian sent my heart racing.  He kissed down my neck, his tongue caressing the lines of collar bone and his teeth nipping at the tender skin.  My breath caught in my throat.  Dorian had just started kissing at the line above my jeans at my left hip when his phone started ringing.  He paused only to pick it up and swipe it off before tossing it across the room.  

I bit my lip as he continued to caress the skin above my jeans as he unzipped them with one hand.  The phone rang again and we tried to ignore it.  But it rang a third time and I sighed.  "You better get that."

Dorian sat up and looked at me, his blue eyes were dark with desire and his lips were wet and swollen from kissing me.  "You sure?"

I nodded.  "They'll keep calling and it's distracting.  It could be important."

Dorian slide off the bed and grinned at me, "Don't move."

I smiled, "Hadn't planned on it."

The phone rang a forth time and Dorian picked up.  I could hear the other side shout, "What the fuck Dorian!  Somethings wrong with Aidan.  You have to help."

I said, "Let's go as I unfurled my arms from the bindings of Dorian's making."

He frowned,  "We'll be right there Stella."

## Fire Starter

I pulled on the orange t-shirt over my head as Dorian pulled a clean white one from his drawer.  I grinned at him as his tattoo'd arm was showing and I'd never seen him in anything other than dress clothes.  I bit my bottom lip and Dorian chuckled softly, "That's not helping any."

I grinned at him.  "Duckling, ain't nuttin gonna fix that right now but I can't stop wanting you."

Dorian kissed me deeply and we almost fell back into bed, but there were more important matters to attend to.  Problems with kids came before our libido.  Dorian pulled away breathlessly and sighed.  "Let's go."

We took the elevator down two floors, I pressed myself against Dorian for more than one reason but his arms wrapped around my waist as I hid my face in the crook of his neck and bit at his neck playfully to distract myself and to continue the current mood we were in.  His hand ran small circles against the small of my back under my shirt that sent shivers down my spine.  There were a few gasps when the doors opened the floor above our destination.  From the whisperes I could tell that my shirt had ridden up my back and they'd seen the scares, the fact that we were two men cuddling in the elevator wasn't the problem this time.  

Dorian pulled the back of my shirt down and I straightened still pressing myself into him as the doors opened to our floor and we got off to more whispers.

Stella was staying in a low end resident area but had a higher end apartment with two bedrooms.  Single mom with a Magnus gained her some status even though she was human.  Dorian knocked on the door as he ran his fingers through his hair to straighten it some.  I laughed.  "There is no fixing it without a mirror.  There is no getting out of the fact that we were just making out."

I turned him to face me and kissed him softly just as the door opened and Stella gasped.  "What the hell!"

I grinned sheepishly at her, "Sorry."

Her jaw dropped, "Nox? What are you doing here?"

Dorian blushed.  "I was with Dorian when you called."  I said plainly.

"Oh."  Stella blushed.  "So you know then?"

"Know who Aidan's father is? Yes.  You said there was something wrong.  Important enough to call four times."

She opened the door still in shock.  "Yeah."

We walked in and I followed.  Stella's apartment was fairly well decorated and there were toys lying all over the floor in front of the TV, there were dirty dishes in the sink and I took a deep breath and tried not to let it bother me.  "Don't mind the mess."  Stella said as if she had read my mind.  "A four year old doesn't lend to a clean house."

I groaned softly under my breath which I received a quick jab from Dorian's elbow in my stomach, Stella thankfully hadn't heard it.  "He's this way."  She said.

She led us to a room with the door wide open and Aidan cozily sleeping in his bed but there was a wall of air blocking the door and I laughed.  "This is your emergency?"

Dorian didn't find it funny.  "What's wrong, Stella?"

Stella glared at me, "Try to go in."

Dorian did and ran into the wall.  He took a step back and focused.  "Oh."

I found the tied off portion of the blocked wall and undid the offending pattern of air.  "Why did he do that?"

Stella just looked at me with fury.  "What am I going to do now?  What if there is a fire? Or what if he's choking.  I can't get to my son."

"The wall is gone now Stella."  I said flatly.  "Why was he keeping you out?  What did you do?"

"I didn't do anything.  He's my son!" Stella cried out.

"You said something, did something that made him want to keep you out.  Sparks happen due to emotion distability."

Stella rushed into Aidan's room and scooped the sleeping child up into her arms waking him.  "He's my son, what do you know of it anyway!"

I frowned. "I know a lot about it actually since I was a fire-starter.  At least Aidan didn't start a fire.  My mother was yelling at me for making a mess.  She grabbed me by the arm and my mind started a fire out of fear.  It wasn't anything I could control because I didn't have any training.  A natural Magnus of enough power will spark at a young age.  Most never notice it because they are innocous ones.  Sand everywhere, a momentary gust of wind, wet areas that were previously dry.  Fire is the only one that guarantee's danger."  My voice was flat and emotionless as I retold the story of my youth.  Dorian's hand was at the small of my back.

Aidan rubbed at his eyes, "Mommy, why are you waking me up?"

Stella sighed and put her little one back in bed.  "I just love you so much baby.  Go back to sleep."  She put him down in his bed and tucked him in while Dorian and I moved into the living area again.  

I started cleaning up.  It was bothering me that much.  Dorian stood and watched me, I could feel his eyes on me while I picked up the legos and matchbox cars and put them in their related boxes.  

Stella walked right past me and into her kitchen and pulled down a bottle of wine and opened it.  She poured herself a glass and then as a second though pulled a second one down and handed hers to Dorian.  "What's he doing?"

Dorian chuckled.  "I think he's cleaning your house."

"Why?"

Dorian continued to answer for me as I picked up the toys on the floor.  "He's a neat freak."  I saw him grin from the top of his wine glass. "More to the point he dislikes when things aren't organized.  Not so much clean but neat."

Stella frowned, "He's going to suck as a parent. Always picking things up."

I stacked the toy boxes in a corner and smiled at Stella. "No I won't suck.  I"ll just be doing a lot of organizing things."

I moved into the kitchen.  "I'm washing the dishes because you look like you could use the help.  Not that you can't or won't but I can at least help with this."

Stella frowned at Dorian.  "Is he always like this?"

Dorian shrugged as I walked past and startd the sink water to running.  "I would assume so."

"You mean you don't know?  You are sleeping with a guy you don't even know that well?"  She sounded angry.  "You wouldn't sleep with me for like three weeks."

I laughed.  "Technically we've not slept together yet, in that way anyway, and we've been together for what, three months now Dorian?"

He laughed, "Two of them you were in a coma so they don't count."

I shrugged from the sink.  "Semantics."

I finished the dishes and stood next to Dorian as he leaned against the bar in Stella's kitchen.  "I'll help Aidan with his sparking tomorrow when we are in class together, it shouldn't happen again."

Stella returned to the kitchen and poured herself another glass of wine and spoke so we couldn't see her face.  "It's kinda ironic that my ex and Aidan's father is hooking up with the guy who wouldn't sleep with me."

I laughed and Doran looked at me with a frown.  "I didn't sleep with her."

He asked, "Did you want to?"

"Yes, but I wouldn't.  She's a mother of a child - a single mother.  I have rules Dorian."

He sighed with a nod and grabbed my belt loop and pulled me close.  "I remember what you told Daniella.  No one underage, no single parents, noone who is married."

Stella turned around she looked angry.  "Dorian's a single parent."

"Not unless you give him custody to Aidan he's not.  He has no children he's the sole guardian too."

Stella sat down at her bar and frowned ar our closeness but when I moved to pull away Dorian held me tight against him.  I couldn't have moved if I had tried harder.  Stella said quiety. "He's still single and a parent."

I smiled at her, "Does that mean you will let him help raise your son?"

Stella frowned, "I don't know.  I'm not sure I like his friends."

"Don't like me?  Or you don't like the fact that he's dating a man?"  I could feel the blood rushing to my face in anger.  Dorian rubbed the small of my back and handed me the glass of wine.  I took a sip but only because Dorian asked me to calm down.

Dorian spoke quietly.  "My friends aren't going to change.  Nox and I are going to go back to my apartment now that the crisis has been averted."

Dorian didn't wait for her to say okay or agree he pulled me after him out her front door and we took the stairs up to his room.  We stopped outside his door with a soft smile.  "I'm sorry about tonight."

I smiled.  "No worries Dorian.  I still had a great time."

Dorian unlocked his door.  "I should tell you to go home now."  I nodded.  He grabbed my belt loops again and pulled me against him.  "But I'd really like to finish what we started."

I kissed Dorian softly.  "Me too.  But we've both got to get up in the morning.  And if I come in we won't be doing much sleeping."

Dorian nodded.  "My thoughts exactly."

"Can I see you tomorrow?"  I asked.

"You can see me anytime Nox."  He pulled me against his body tighter and I groaned against the feel of his body.  We kissed deep and throughly until he pulled away breathless.  "I'll see you tomorrow love."

I stepped back and watched Dorian open his door and step inside. "Tomorrow love."

Dorian closed the door and I went to my room, which didn't have a bed but I'd slept in worse places before.## Little Lessons

I went back to my empty apartment and rolled out my sleeping bag in what would constitute my bedroom when I actually got a bed installed.  At least it was clean now and I wasn't sceeving out over that fact.  I lay staring at the ceiling counting the stains.  They looked like someone flipped embers at them.  I was going to have to redecorate and that did not sound fun.  

I eventurally drifted to sleep with the knowledge that I could smell Dorian all over my shirt.  My dreams eventually woke me up.  I sat bolt upright with the sun streaming through the window in my bedroom I hadn't even realized I had.  I found my phone buzzing silently as I missed my alarm.  I could still feel the nightmare as it fled my system, but the memory was lighter and softer than usual.  My pulse was still in my throat and my body covered in sweat.  

I got up and made breakfast, or what constituted breakfast from the microwave.  But I ate it anyway as much as I hated it.

I made my way to my new job.  I wore jeans and the same button up shirt I wore last night with Dorian.  It still smelled like him, but a lot like me too, it was disapointing really.  I was begining to think I was crazy the way I kept thinking about Dorian.  He was never far from my thoughts.

I walked into my classroom and there was a woman sitting in a small chair organizing some crafting supplies at the table.  "Hi."  I interrupted her organizing.  "I'm Nox.  Dae'lin told me to report here to teach some kids?"  I didn't sound overly convinced I should be here and I wasn't.

She stood up.  "My name is Helen and you are correct.  I am your assitant and the primary caretaker of the children.  You can set your own schedule to teach the children and your own lessons.  You can spend 4 hours a day teaching them out of eight."

I smiled as I offerd the small brunette my hand, "A pleasure.  Today I'll keep it simple.  I know one of them has sparked already and the others if I'm correct are all showing signs?"

"That is what they tell me, I'm just a child care provider."  She took my hand and I brought it to my lips and kissed the middle knuckle softly.

The first parent walked in as I was dropping Helen's hand to her side.  A small boy with black hair and eyes walked in holding on to his father's leg.  The dad said, "Go sit down Henry."  He looked up at me as he was trying to pry his son from his leg.  He offered me his hand.  "Eric Eskridge."

"Nox Sétanta.  I remember you from the Academy."  I took his hand.  "Your father is on the council."  

"Everyone seems to remember that."  

I grinned.  "So is mine."

"Kai Viddens right?"  Eric asked.

"Yep."  I knelt down to the small boy still clinging to his father's leg.  "Hey there Henry.  Why don't you come and sit down and we'll play a game. I'm sure your Dad has to get to work."  I formed a ball of fire above my hands.  "Think you can do this with me?"

Henry's eyes grew wider as he saw and I formed a second one slowly for him.  "Come on.  Let's try."

Henry came and held out both of his hands and I saw the small patterns forming above his hands and a small fire ball floated before he blinked and then it was gone.  I heard Eric's gasp.  He knelt down next to his son and patted his head.  "That was awesome little buddy.  Why don't you stay here with Mr. Nox and he'll teach you how to do more."

Hery nodded emphatically and I offfered him my hand and he took it quickly.  "I'll take care of him."

He whispered above his son's head as we stood up.  "We've been afraid he'll spark."

I smiled.  "After today he won't spark.  I promise.  My goal today is to make them safer and knowledgeable of what they can do.  They aren't too young to learn.  They just need a juvinail mind to show them the path."

Eric chuckled.  "I heard that about you."

I smiled and ran my fingers through my hair.  "At least you've heard of me."

"That's not exactly the quote."

I laughed.  "I know.  You are the worst pirate I have ever heard of.  But you've heard of me."  I smiled.  "Jack is awesome."

Eric laughed.  "I will see you later little man." And he left just as the twins walked in with their mother.

I knelt down in front of them.  "Hey.  I'm Nox.  What's your name?"  I signed the question, it was about all I could manage to learn last night while I tried to fall asleep.

The little girl giggled.  "I'm Rhiana and this is Joey."  

"It's a pleasure to meet you both.  You are going to have to help me understand your brother alright? That's all the sign language I know right now."

Helen stepped closer.  "I can help as well Nox.  I am an expert in languages, which is why I'm here in the first place."

"Excellent.  You can teach me.  I teach them and we'll all be happy."

"Rhiana and Joey why don't you take Henry and go play for a little while while we waite on the rest of your class."

Their mother shoved them off in the direction of the toys and Henry went along giggling with them.  She smiled at me.  "Janice."

I nodded and offered her my hand which she took and I lifted it to kiss as usual.  "Nox.  A pleasure."

"Don't borther Mr. Sétanta.  I know exactly what you are."

I smiled.  "And that means what exactly?  Know I'm Cesari, Minorem?"

"Gay."  She said flatly.

"I'm not gay.  I'm bi if you must put a label on it.  I like men.  I like women.  But what does that have to do with me paying my respects to a beautiful woman?"

Janice rolled her eyes.  "I'm not comfortable with you teaching my children.  And I will be speaking with the Academy head master to remove you from this position of impressionalbe young minds."

I sighed.  "So I'm going to teach them to be gay is that it?"

Helen stepped in and guided Janice out of the room I heard her say, "I will watch the children."  But she didn't indicate she'd watch me.  I wasn't sure if that was good or bad.  I truly didn't want to have to speak to this woman again and her homophobic views on life.

Helen came back and smiled at me.  "I'm sorry.  I should have warned you about Mrs. James-Burnett.  She's been against you since we found out about your appointment.  She has been lobbying fairly hard to get that overturned."

I shrugged.  "No big deal.  I deal with it everyday."

Helen reached up and pulled a blue lock of hair from the top of my head and settled in on my forehead.  "I'm sure this has nothing to do with it."

I laughed.  "Sorry.  My boyfriend likes it."

"Your boyfriend?  And you still flirt with everyone."

I nodded.  "My boyfriend and yes I will flirt unless he says otherwise."  

Stella arrived in a huff.  "I'm sorry I'm late.  Aidan go play."  She looked at me.  "Nox.  Thank you for last night.  I'm sorry for being rude."

I shrugged.   "No worries, Stella.  Just glad to help."

She hugged me.  "I'm sorry about your past too."

"Nothing to worry yourself over.  I'm over it."  I lied with a smile on my face.  I knew I wasn't over it, I still dreamt about it.

"I have to get to class."  Stella turned to Aidan. "You be good baby."

He didn't pay attention to her as he was busy playing with her friends.  Stella turned to Helen, "My boyfriend will be here to pick Aidan up."  My eyes were open wide as I wasn't aware she had a boyfriend.  Helen nodded and Stella was out the door.

"You are friends with Ms. Row?"

I nodded, "She's my boyfriend's ex and Aidan's father."

"Oh."  Helen's eyes were wide in shock as a little boy with ebony skin and golden hair and orange eyes.  I knew that face.  I cried for that face.  He skidded to a halt three feet from Helen and I and she smiled at him.  "Drake, this is Nox.  He's going to teach us."

I knelt down to his level and offered him my hand.  "Hi."  I said.  "I remember you.  I carried you once upon a time."  

He took my hand and brought it to his nose and sniffed my skin.  I grinned at him, knowing that I'd done the same on occassion when I was young seeking comfort in people who I'd met.  He hugged me quickly and tightly before he was off playing with his friends.  I watched as the five of them played with the toys.  Helen smiled.  "That's a better reaction than I got.  He doesn't speak much.  His ancestry has hindered his adoption.  Being a dragon scares most parents."

I nodded.  "Shall we start class?"  I stood up and moved to the circle on the floor.  "Hey guys, can ya come join me here.  I want to show you some things.  And then I want you to show me a few things."  They all put away the toys like old hat then came to sit on the circluar rug in their own colored pie areas and looked at me expectantly.  Helen sat off to one side so Joey could see her.  I was going to have to learn sign laugnage if I was going to do this for any long period of time.  I didn't like being unable to communicate with someone.

"I'm Nox.  I'm gonna be your teacher for a while.  I'm a Cesari."

Aidan raised his hand. "What's a Cesari?"

"A Cesari is a Magnus who can bend all four elements.  Which means that I can do magic."  I smiled at them, "Which means all of you can do magic too."  To emphasize my point I created four orbs - one for each element.  They floated above my hands and I saw Henry's glee as he held his hands in front of him and a flicker and a flash latter he had a small floating orb of fire.

The other kids all looked at Henry in awe and were sitting in front of him asking all sorts of question to which he answered, "Nox showed me how."

"If you all sit down and pay attention I'll show you slowly."  They listened and I showed then slowly how to make an orb of fire.  All five could bend fire.  All five could bend all four elements but they wouldn't likely have tested that way.

And sooner rather than later there were five orbs of fire sitting on their hands.  Even Drake had one.  His was larger and brighter than the others, but that was to be expected of a dragon.  One of the original Magnus in blood.  

We worked on creating each element and then we went through some protection techniques in the forms of a game.  It was meant to keep them safe from them self.  By the end of our four hours together they were begging for me to stay, but I had to go and they were more than equipped after this one lesson they weren't going to spark and harm someone.  

All the kids except Drake had lunch dates with their parents.  But when I saw who walked in for Aidan I froze.  The dark brown eyes that stared back at me with that slime smile froze my blood.  Aidan ran up and hugged Garrett's legs.  "Hi, Garrett.  This is my teacher, Nox."

He patted Aidan's back, "I know.  I taught Nox when he was your age."

Aidan looked up at Garrett with big blue eyes just like his father's.  "You taught Nox?  Can you teach me?"

My blood ran cold at those words, and my heart speed up to a painful pace.  I cluthced at my heart as Garrett smiled at me. "I'm sure I can show you a thing or two."  Garrett winked at me, "Come on Aidan let's go to lunch."

I watched as Aidan left with Garrett holding his hand and I stood frozen in terror.  Aidan...

Garrett turned around and smiled at me.  "You must come to dinner.  You and I have a few things to discuss, bring a bottle of wine.  And leave your precious little boyfriend at home.  Just the family and you, or things might get messy."



## Punching Bag for Dad

I don't know how long I stood there but I felt a small hand on my leg.  "Can you take me to lunch?"

I looked down and saw those orange eyes staring up and me and I had to smile.  "I can.  Do you mind if I have a friend with me?"

He shook his head and smiled and raised his hands for me to pick him up which I did.  I dialed Dorian, he answered, "Nox?"

"Hey Dorian.  You have lunch plans?  I have a little dragon here who wants to grab some food with me and I could really use your company."

"Sure.  Meet you in the cafeteria?"  Dorian asked.

"Sounds good.  See you in a few."  I hung up and shifted Drake to carry him better.  "You ready?"

He nodded and I looked at Helen.  "This alright?"

She nodded.  "He and I usually go to lunch together."

"Alright.  Come on little man."  We made it to the cafeteria ahead of Dorian and we stood at he entrance waiting for him to show up.  Several people passed us with strange looks.  Apparently myself and this little dragon drew alot of looks.

Dorian snuck up on me and kissed my cheek and Drake gave a little squeek.  "Hey love.  This is Drake.  Drake, this is my boyfriend Dorian, he's going to eat lunch with us.  Is that okay?"

Drake nodded.  "He smells like cookies."

I grinned.  "I know isn't it great?"

"I what?"  Dorian asked.

I wrapped my arm around Dorian and we walked into the cafeteria.  I told Dorian, "You smell like cinnamon and vanilla, kinda like cookies." I whispered, "And I love it."

"I've never been told that before."  He rubbed the top of Drake's head.  "You smell like Nox, Drake - a campfire, the kind you make hotdogs and smores on."

"I've never had smores."

"No?"  Dorian asked.

Drake shook his head.  Dorian grinned.  "We'll have to fix that then.  Maybe you can come spend the night with us with Aidan and we can have a cookout."

Drake nodded with eagerness.

We stood in line and were through it before Ms. Shelia saw me and grinned as she saw me carrying Drake on my hip and Dorian's hand on my waist.  We sat down at an empty table.  We were talking to Drake when I saw a familiar form approaching.  I was about to stand up when another one stepped up behind me and put his hand on my shoulder.  "Hey, Aaron," my father said.

Aaron stopped and looked at my father.  "Mr. Viddens.  I was just passing through."

He stepped around Kai with a dirty glance in my general direction.  My father sat down next to Dorian.  "Who's this, Nox?"

I smiled at my father.  "His name is Drake.  Drake, this is my dad, Kai Viddens."

Drake blinked his orange eyes at my father as he ate his lunch.  "Drake doesn't talk much to strangers."

Kai smiled.  "That's alright."  He looked up at me. "Nox, was wondering if you wanted to hit the gym after lunch, get some of those skill squared away after your lax training these past few months."

"Are you offering to help?"

"Yeah.  You are my son."  He said with no sense of irony.

Dorian reached across the table and patted my hand.  "Drake and I'll be fine.  Go on."

I looked at Drake, "That okay with you?"

He nodded and pulled me close so he could whisper in my ear.  "I like Dorian."

I smiled at him.  "Me too."

"Alright.  Let's go."  I stood up and walked around the table.  I bent down and kissed Dorian softly on the lips and could taste the sickly sweet soda taste on his lips but I didn't care as he pulled every breath from my body in that tiny kiss.  I pulled away and grinned at him.  "Damn."  I whispred to him.  I bit my bottom lip before I kissed him on the forehead and waved at Drake.  "See ya tomorrow buddy."  I put my hand on Dorian's shoulder, "See you later love."

Kai followed me down the aisle of tables and all I could hear were the hushed whisperes that echoed in the chaos of the cafeteria.  Kai laughed as we exited, "You'd think they'd never seen someone kiss someone before."

I smiled.  "They've never seen Dorian kiss anyone, and especially not someone like me."

"You love him don't you?" Kai asked.

"Yeah. I do.  It scares the fuck out of me too."  I confided in my father for the frist time in my life.  

Kai put his hand on my shoulder and squeezed.  "It scares everyone.  Margo told me that she had to tell you we were seeing each other."  I nodded.  "Your thoughts?  She said you seemed angry."

"I wasn't angry at you or her. I was angry that they used it against her to pull her off my case.  She's been my therapist longer than you've know I've existed.  To think she didn't have my best interest at heart is a crock of shit."

Kai nodded. "It is, but you are out now."

"Only because I threatened the doctor who was poisoning me."  I could feel the fury rising.  "I could really use a good match."

Kai laughed.  "It's a good thing I'm here then."

We walked in relative silence the rest of the way to the gym Kai wanted to use.  It was more just a ring in a room - meant for teaching kids the basics, but it would work well for our purposes.  We warmed up with stretches and before we knew it we were dancing around each other in the sparring ring.  

I was completely absorbed in the fight until I caught the soft scent of cookies drifting my dirction.  I glanced in the direction of the door and saw Dorian and Drake watching silently, but that had been a mistake and Kai landed several blows before I fell backwards.  He shook his head, "You are easily distracted boy."

I sighed as I took my father's offered hand for assistance up.  "Sorry.  I didn't expect an audience."

Dorian chuckled.  "I can leave if you'd prefer.  Drake wanted to watch what you were doing though."

I shrugged.  "I'm good, just didn't expect it.  We good?  Again?"

Kai nodded and started circling me again.  We went around three or four times before I attacked my father with several jabs and a round house.  None really connected well but he was grinning madly at me for my attempt at agression.  He let lose a series of punches and kicks all of which I blocked with either my body or a pillar of air.  

My father was full Venatori and his stamina was endless compared to mine.  Even in defensive positions I was growing weaker and the fact that I was still coming down from the poison in my system and the weakness from my months of inactivity. I was tired faster than I should have been, but I pushed until I could do no more.

I sank to the mat on my knees when my body refused to move anymore.  Kai nodded.  "Considering.  That was well done son.  Rest tomorrow and we'll go again."

I nodded and my dad headed for the door and knelt down in front of Drake.  "Can I take you back to class.  Let Dorian take care of Nox?  I think he needs a little help."

Drake nodded and took my father's hand and they left.  Dorian stood in the door way as I crumpled to the floor and lay staring up at the ceiling.  He chuckled at me.  "Tired?"

I shook my head.  "That's an understatement."  I looked over at him and saw the amusement in his eyes.  "Help me up?"

Dorian walked over to me and offered me a hand and I let him pull me to my feet.  I stumbled into him, my knees still a little weak from exhaustion.  "I think I should eat again."

Dorian chuckled.  "All you do is eat anymore."

I shrugged.  "I can think of a few other things I'd like to do, but I really don't have the energy."

Dorian rolled his eyes as he pulled me close and kissed me.  My body relaxed into his and I nearly fell again, if it were not for Dorian's grasp on my waist I likely would have.  I chuckled between kisses.  "Well that a first."

Dorian pulled away and helped me steady myself, "What is?"

"A kiss making me weak in the knees."  

Dorian smiled at me.  "Happy to help."

I wanted to continue what we'd started the night before but I knew Dorian was in the middle of his day.  "I have dinner plans tonight, but can I stop by afterwards?"  I asked.

"Of course.  Can I ask with who?"

"Stella and Garrett..."## Pre-Dinner Gitters

I hadn't really thought about it since Drake had asked me to take him to lunch.  Priorities, but now that I was talking about it with Dorian I could feel the pure terror rising up inside.  I whispered, "He told me not to bring you."

Dorian sighed, "Nox you don't have to go."

I nodded, "I do.  If I don't there could be consequences.  People like Aidan could get hurt Dorian.  I have to go."

"He scares you Nox.  He won't hurt anyone."

"And if he does?"  I stood staring into Dorian's deep blue eyes.  "How could I face you if he hurt your family?  Your son?  His mom?"  I could feel the tears slidin down my cheek.  Dorian reached up and wiped it away.  "I can't have that on my head Dorian."

He nodded and pulled me close and wrapped his arms around me tight.  "What time is dinner?"

"Six."  I whispered.

Dorian nodded, "If you aren't at my apartment by 8 I will come looking for you."

I looked at Dorian and smiled.  "Okay."  I pulled away, "I need to eat again."

Dorian laughed.  "I have to get to work.  I will see you tonight?"

I nodded.  "Yes.  Though I don't know how I'll be."

"I understand."  He kissed me softly and we headed out the gym door.   I followed him to the elevator and while we waited for it to go in the correct direction Dorian held me against him.  "Look at me." 

I hadn't realized I was staring off into space.  I could feel the terror coursing through my veins and Dorian flinched when I turned my eyes to him.  "Why don't you come up to my office with me.  I'll order you something to eat and you can stay there and work."

I nodded unable to speak.  I really couldn't think about work. But I felt better with Dorian so I went with him in the elevator.  He held my hand as I stood stiff as a board staring at the doors.  One fear on top of the other wasn't helping.

We got off the elevator and I followed behind Dorian in a daze.  He opened the door to his office and I sat down in a chair that I'd probably sat in a million times when it was someone else's office.  Dorian sat down in his chair and picked up his phone and I assume he ordered food.  I didn't hear much about the conversation because I could only hear the pulse in my ears.  Dorian came around the desk and sat down in the chair next to me.  "You alright?"

"Yeah."  I lied.  "I'll be okay."

Dorian laughed softly and ran his fingers through the multi colored strands on y head.  "No gel today?"

I smiled.  "I wasn't going to impress kids with spikey hair."

"I like this better."  Dorian ran his fingers through my hair again laying it to the side. 

"You just like running your fingers through my hair."  I smiled at him, "And I must admit that I like when you do."  I relaxed into his touch.  "I like everything about you and how you make me feel."

Dorian grinned at me and stood up.  "You up to a little work?"

I nodded.  "What you need?"

"Help me devise a plan to teach our testers how to read patterns like you do."  

And that's what we did until the food arrived.  Dorian had ordered chineese.  "I hope you can find something here to eat."

I smiled.  "Thank you Dorian.  I'll eat whatever is here."

"You need to tell what's acceptable and what's not."  He said.

I nodded as I opened the take out box and used chop sticks to eat the noodles and vegetables in the box.  "Less carbs, more protien and vegetables.  Always a good formula."

Dorian chuckled.  "Says the guy eating lo mein."

I grinned at him.  We continued to work out a plan to teach adults new ways of thinking without making them feel like a child.

We worked and ate and I was satisfactorily distracted until my phone beeped at me.  I pulled it out without a second thought and saw the text was from Garrett.  I dropped my phone and it bounced under Dorian's chair.  He bent and picked it up and saw the text and frowned.  "He wants you to bring a bottle of wine."

I nodded.  

Dorian sent a reply and handed me my phone. He picked up the phone on his desk and hit one button.  I didn't hear who picked it up.  But I heard Dorians side of the converation.  "Silas.  I need you have a chilled Merlot sent to Garrett Spencer's place at 6:45 tonight.   Make sure Nox Sétanta's name is on it."

He hung up the phone.  I said, "You didn't have to do that."

He smiled at me.  "Yes I did Nox.  You have no taste for wine and Garrett Spencer does.  And besides it's something I can do to help you in this trying moment."

I nodded.  I glanced at the time of the text and frowned.  "I should go get dressed."

Dorian frowned at me.  I continued "I need a shower.  You can join me..."

Dorian chuckled.  "What I wouldn't give, love.  But not before you go to see your demons."

I sighed, "What prefect tme before I have to go to have you on my mind."

He grinned at me.  "So think of it as a reward for surviving him."

I laughed.  "Fine. I still need a shower."  I stood up and and walked to Dorian side of the desk and sat on the edge of it.  He stood up and stepped in front of me pressing against me.  I bit my bottom lip as I stared into his eyes.  His hands ran through the sides of my hair and I couldn't help the sound that left my mouth.  He grinned at me and kissed me softly.

My body was tight against his.  I whispered, "I should go."

Dorian steped back with a lust filled look on his face.  "That enough incentive?"

I kissed him as I stood up and smiled.  "It is."

I left Dorian's office.  I could feel his eyes on me a I walked towards the elevator.  I winked at him as I turned and the elvator doors closed.## Dinner with the Demon

I grabbed a shower and put on jeans and a t-shirt with a gray hoodie over it all.  I wanted to spend the night with Dorian, but that wasn't for a few more hours.  I sighed as I headed towards Garrett's apartment.  It was not a far walk really and I was going to arrive around the same time the wine did which would be a good thing.

I stood in front of the door about ready to knock but I couldn't make myself do it.  But the wine arrived and the man knocked on the door.  I heard shuffling feet towards the door and then a squeal as the door rattled open.  Aidan stared up at me as the man handed the adult behind him the wine.  

Garrett laughed.  "Your boyfriend ordered the wine.  You can't even manage a simple request."

I glared at him as he opened the door for me to walk inside.  Stella was brightly sitting on the bar opening the wine and pouring it.  "Hey Nox.  So glad you can join us."

I nodded and smiled at her.  I still couldn't talk, my body moved out of habit and I knew where Garrett wanted me before he even spoke.  I stood helpless in my fear as his hand touched my arm to get my attention before pointing to a chair.  I sat down and Aidan crawled up in my lap.  It brought my attention to him and I smiled at him.  "Hey Aidan."

He grinned up at me.  "Can you show me how to make a fireball again?"

Stella looked at me with fear in her eyes.  I grinned at him.  "I don't think your mom wants me to show you that here.  How about water?"

He nodded and I formed a ball of water above my hand slowly and watched as Aidan took in each movement.  I could see his eyes folowing each strand and each twist and turn before he held his hand out and made one too.  "See Mommy, I can do it too."

Garrett looked at me with pride in his eyes.  I wasn't sure if it was for me or for Aidan, but I didn't like it either way.  I was not his puppet.  "He's not even been tested yet."

I looked at my once upon a time mentor and smiled at him.  "Children like games.  It's easy to teach them to be safe with all the elements without even knowing what they can touch.  But I knew all of them could be Cesari with the right training."

Garrett smiled.  "I knew you'd have much to give to the Venatori when I first met you."

I rolled my eyes.  "I'm sure you did."

Stella smiled at Aidan, "That is so wonderful."  But she didn't sound sincere, more afraid.  Afraid of her own son... my heart ached for Aidan.  His mother was afraid of him.  The man she was dating I feared for his own life.  And here he sat completely ignorant of thsoe things around him.

Garrett worked in the kitchen finishing the final touches on his dinner which actually smelled rather good.  My stomach rumbled and Aidan giggled at the sound.  "Mommy, Nox's tummy is hungry."

I grinned down at him.  "I'm alright I can wait till Garrett is done."

The little boy hopped down and grabbed a carrot stick and handed it to me.  "Vegetables can be eaten any time."

"I like that rule." I took the carrot stick from him and snapped it between my teeth as Garrett looked at me with his slimey smile.

I froze mid-chew and he laughed.  "Dinner is ready.  Aidan go washyour hands."

Stella took her son towards the bathroom to assist him.  I got up to help Garrett and he smiled again at me.  "I have a favor to ask of you."

"Of course you do."  I said flatly.  I didn't like the way he said favor.  I didn't like the way he was looking at me.

He stood in front of me and pressed me against the counter as if he were my lover and he laughed softly.  It was very unsettling. "You will get me Mark Green's agenda for the next few weeks."

He grabbed me behind my neck and dug his fingers into my neck.  "Imagine what I could do to your little friend if you don't listen to me."

The water in the enxt room stopped running and Aidan came running out to sit at the table.  I nodded and moved away from Garrett.  I could feel his hands on my neck, his body pressed against mine.  I felt the soft caress of air against my check as it snaked arcorss my body.  I closed my eyes as I walked around the bar to sit down next to Aidan.

It took everything I had not freak out while I shared a meal with my demon.  He threatened me and mine and I could do nothing but what he wanted out of fear.  We finished dinner and I helped Garrett with the dishes.  He smiled at me as I washed them and he dried them.  

If it weren't for the fact that it was Garrett's house and Garrent's dinner I might have had a good time.  I glanced at my phone and saw the time.  "I need to go."

"So early?"

I shrugged.  "I have other plans to tend to."

Garrett laughed.  "Meeting with your blue-eyed lover?"  He grabbed my elbow and guided me to the door and smiled.  "You will bring me that information in two days time.  Or you might find yourself a little lonelier than you remembered ever being."

I nodded as he opened the door and stepped through.  He chuckled softly, "Two days Nox.  And say hi to Dorian Vega for me.  Tell him I know exactly what he sees in you."

I walked away from the door and towards the stairs.  I walked numbly up the stairs.  I was not feeling much like company but I had promised to see Dorian before 8.  It was only a few flights of stairs but when I reached the right floor my legs felt like dead weights and I was walking slower than normal.  I stopped in front of Dorian's door and knocked.  I was still a little dazed when he opened his door and smiled at me.  

I felt better the moment I looked into his eyes.  I stepped into him and kissed him long and hard.  A throat cleared behind Dorian and I took a step back.  "I'm sorry."

Dorian smiled and pulled me closer as he moved to let me in.  He closed the door after I'd stepped inside my body still pressed against him.  I heard the familiar voice of his friend Todd.  "Oh get a room."

I smiled and leaned my forehead against Dorian's.  "I didn't know you'd have company."

Dorian smiled and walked towards the kitchen and handed me a glass of water.  "I didn't know he was going to stop by.  Todd was just showing me some of his work."

"Ah.  What is it you do Todd?"

He smiled at me with a prefectly white smile and ice blue eyes that light up when he looked at us.  "I'm a genetisist."

"And you came to Dorian for what?"  I asked.

Dorian laughed.  "Just a second set of eyes to see if I thinks he's on the correct path."

"And is he?"  I asked as I sat down on the couch.  Dorian sat down next to me with his wine glass and I put my hand in his lap.  

Dorian smiled.  "I think you'd be far better an determining that."

"Really?"  I asked.

"Of course," he said.  "Show him Todd."

"I doubt our young friend here will understand it.  He was never very good with school things, just getting beat up."  Todd chuckled as he handed me some diagrams.

I looked at them and I really didn't have much to say about them.  "What am I looking at?"

"Genetic maps."

I laid them down on the coffee table one at a time and I started to see patterns come together.  "This one has elements almost identical to the other three."

Todd choked on his wine and he coughed it up into his hands.  Dorian hurried to the kitchen and got Todd a towel.  

"I take it I was right?"  

Dorian laughed.  "Yeah.  We both agreed with him.  Except he didn't tell you anything, you just found it."  He handed Todd the towel.  "Nox is good with patterns.  He doesn't need to understand the logic behind it, he just sees it.  I've come to learn to trust his judgement in such things these past few weeks."

Todd nodded.  "I think that I will leave the two of you alone."

Dorian walked Todd to the door and I leaned back against Dorian's couch and took in the scents with my eyes closed.  I felt Dorian standing in front of me.  I opened my eyes and he was looking down at me with a glass of wine touching his lips.  I took his hand and pulled him down into my lap.  He sat facing me his legs on either side of me and an arm resting on the couch back behind me and the other holding his wine glass with elegance.

"How are you doing love?"

I smiled up at him.  "He asked me to get information about Mark Green."

He nodded.  "Did he say why?"

"I didn't ask.  I could barely talk much less question his motives.  He threatened Aidan and you."

"He can't hurt us."  Dorian leaned down and kissed me softly on the lips.

I turned my head to the side and instead of stopping Dorian sucked on my ear lobe and my neck which made a guttral sound escape my mouth even as I whispered.  "He can.  And I have to listen."


## That Night and the Next Morning

I pulled Dorian closer to me and  smiled up at him, "But I want to forget that for now."

I took the glass from Dorian's hand and set it on the floor and lifted Dorian to the couch and I laid on top of him.  I kissed him had and one of his hands found the back of my neck and the other clutched at my shirt.  

Our bodies were hard against one another, I could taste the wine on his lips.  The feel of his teeth and tongue against my neck made me shake.  I wanted nothing more than to feel his body against mine.  Dorian bit my neck softly before he whispered against it, his breath sending shivers up my spine.  "We aren't teenagers."  He sat up manuerving me into his lap easily.  "The bed has far more room and way more comfortable."

I stood up and he followed me up but I followed him to his room.  Dorian took his phone from his pocket and turned it off.  He took mine form me and did the same setting them both on the night stand.  He whispered, "No interruptions this time."

My body ached for him.  He stood before me a dark light in his eyes and pulled my t-shirt over my head and undid his own buttons as I reached inside and pushed it off of him.  We kissed and touched and explored each other's bodies long before we were lying on the bed, Dorian on top of me and I could want nothing more than him.  

Our bodies were tangled around each other and with the blankets below. Before the night was over we were both panting and sweating in the glow of estasy.  I drifted into nothingness naked lying half on top of Dorian.  My fingers entwined in his at my back and the other tracing the edge of the tattoo that ran the complete half of his body.  

***

I woke to the sun streaming through the window still curled up naked next to Dorian.  There was a small pool of drool on Dorian's chest.  Not embarassing at all.  Though it wouldn't have been the first of it on his body, and not likely the last.  I unfurled slowly from him feeling refreshed but his arm tightened around my body.  I nipped at his neck then whispered, "I'm not going anywhere.  I promise.  Bathroom."

He let me go and rolled over and curled against an extra pillow.  I stared at the long line of his body for far too long before I went into the bathroom to take a shower.  His bathroom smelled of him and I was soon lost in the soft scent of Dorian when the bathroom door opened and Dorian stepped in wearing just his birthday suit.  My body stiffened and my mouth went dry.  I bit my bottom lip.  "Care to join me?"

Dorian didn't answer my question before he had me in the shower pressed up against the cold tile and I could feel him against me.  The warm water rained down on our hot bodies and it felt cold.  I could only feel the press of Dorian against me.  His body moving with mine.  For all the flirting we'd done earlier, for every kiss and every nerve ending he'd awakened the night before, Dorian was finding new ways to make my mind and body soar with delight.  

We eventually got clean, and dressed, though I still had no idea the time.  I made breakfast in Dorian's kitchen.  I'd brought fixings the night before but I hadn't stayed the night.  I used it now since it was still there.

Dorian watched me as he padded around his living room in jeans and a t-shirt.  I watched him move through picking things up that had been scattered the night before.  I spoke loud enough so he could hear me.  "I like this outfit."

Dorian looked up at me from across the room.  "I figured you might.  It is a weekend, I don't always wear a suit and tie."

"You could have fooled me.  So if it's a weekend, what do you plan on doing?"

Dorian grinned.  "Spend the day with you.  If that's alright."

"What if I want to spend the day with you?"

Dorian chuckled.  "I think I could be persuaded to allow that."

Breakfast consisted of a tomato and spinach fritatta and mimosas - Dorian's addition to the meal.  I siped at the sparkling drink but didn't finish it.  Dorian downed mine when we were cleaning up.  "You don't drink much do you?"  He asked.

I shook my head.  "A beer or two at most.  I'm not a big fan of lost control."

He smiled.  "Neither am I but it's relaxing."

"Not for me.  I get anxious I'll do something stupid."

Dorian laughed.  "Nox Sétanta doing something stupid, that's not something I've ever seen."  He kissed me softly and took my hand and headed for the door.  "Let's go for a walk."

"Alright.  But I need my phone."  

Dorian frowned slightly before he pulled it from his pocket.  "If you inisit."

I turned it on and checked the time and my schedule and moved things around as Dorian pulled on socks and shoes.  I was enjoying the sight of him bent over when he stood up and I handed him my phone with it off as he'd handed it to me.  "I am free now and I can spend all day with you without worry and anxiety."

Dorian took my phone from my hand his fingers brushing the back of my hand.  "I don't need this."

I smiled.  "I want you to keep it for the day.  You temper my anxiety, you might as well keep me from following up on the things that I can easily deal with tomorrow."

I sighed, "Though there is a matter of information I need to get."

"What do you need?"

"His schedule for the next two weeks and I need it to have it to Garrett in two days." 

Dorian nodded.  "One second.  "

I caught Dorian's arm as he went to pick up his phone.  "Please don't jeopardize your reputation for me.  I can get it.  It's not hard.  Can we go to the archives for a little bit.  We can visit your mother and I can borrow a computer."

Dorian put his phone back in his pocket.  "Yes.  I'd like her to meet you."

I smiled and we walked out of his apartment hand in hand.

The Archives were just as I remembered them - large and full of dust covered books that smelled of old paper.  The computers were off to the side and I kissed Dorian on the cheek and went to use one while he went to the large ciruclar desk to greet an older feminie version of himself with bright green eyes.

It wasn't much to log in to a computer and look up Mark Green's schedule.  I had access to it, every hunter could.  Garrett could but he was not part of the ruling family.  It had it's perks at times and that's why he wanted it.  I didn't hide my tracks as I acessed the right information and wrote down his schedule on a scrap of paper.  Downloading would lead to me.  Not taht looking it up wouldn't but at least it was more to the point that I was just glancing at it.

I wished for Dorian's memory but I didn't want to involve him in it.  But he already knew anyway not that it mattered.  I don't know why Garrett wanted the information but I was afraid of him enough I didn't need to have Dorian in harms way.

I got up and found Dorian still talking with his mother.  I joined them with a smile.  I offered her my hand.  "Nox Sétanta."

"This is my mother, Dolores Vega."  Dorian in toned.   She took my hand and I brought it to my lips and kissed it gently.  

"A pleasure."

She smiled with her bright green eyes at me.  "You never said he was a charmer."

"He's not so much a charmer, Mother as one who likes to flirt with everyone."  Dorian's voice filled with amusement.

I grinned at Dorian and wrapped my arm around his waist.  "I only have eyes for your son, Mrs. Vega.  Though if you were a few years younger..."

She blushed and Dorian kissed my cheek.  "He would rival you in the kitchen, Mother."

"Oh really?  He will have to come by and cook for the family."

Dorian nodded.  "When he's ready to meet the rest of the family perhaps."  He turned to me, "Did you get what you wanted?"

I nodded.  "Yep."  I turned to his mother with a bright smile.  "It's a pleasure, and I'd love to cook for your family oneday - soon."

"Sounds wonderful."

"I will see you at dinner tomorrow night Mother."  Dorian wrapped his arm under mine and headed towards the exit.  "What shall we do?"## Day of Bliss

I could think of a great many things I'd like to do with Dorian that day, but we walked down the stairs hand in hand and out of the AU building int the busy morning streets of New York.  We walked for several blocks without saying anything.  Dorian's hand locked in mine rubbing gentle circles on the back of my hand.

We walked through Central Park still in silence.  We walked for nearly an hour hand in hand with no words shared.  It wasn't awkward but I wanted to do something, other than walk.  "Do you want to go dancing Dorian?"

He looked at me with a surprise. "Uh."  He looked at me and grinned.  "Sure why not."

"Perfect."  I smiled.  "I know this place around the corner you should like."

Dorian looked like he wanted to frown or run away from my suggestion.  I gripped his hand tighter and drew him in closer to me.  "You'll like it I promise."

Dancing was one of those things I had enjoyed doing most of my life.  It was my first attempt at integrating into a mundane world - humans liked to dance and I was only 10 when I left the Academy the first time seeking human companionship since Venatori ones weren't exactly the greatest thing in the world for me.

I found this little dance studio and enrolled in classes.  I smiled when I saw the familiar building and rang the bell.  A soft voice scratched over the little intercom.  "May I help you?"

"Is Margarette in?"  I asked.

"Who's asking?"  

"Nox.  I was hoping to steal an hour or two of studio time."

The door buzzed and we walked in as the intercome said, "Come on up."

Dorian looked puzzeled and I smiled at him. We walked the two flights of stairs up to the dance studio and a woman in pink leotards and barefoot stood waiting.  Her hair was grayer than I remembered but she wore the same smile I adored.  I offered her my hand and she let me bring it to my lips for a kiss.  She rolled her eyes as I said.  "Margarette, this is Dorian, my boyfriend.  Dorian Ms. Margarette Cheateu dance instructor to the stars."

"A nice surprise, Nox.  Dorian do come in."  She held the door forus and let it close behind her.  There was a dance class in progress, a group of ten girls all practicing different ballet steps as a warm up.  Dorian looked at me with shock.

"Do I looke like a ballerina to you?"  I asked.

Dorian grinned.  "I wouldn't put it past you."

Margarette's laugh was like summer bells sounding on the wind.  "Nox tried ballet once.  The girls were a little mean."

I stuck my tongue at her, "Only a little.  They laughed at the outfit you made me wear."

"That's not what they were laughing at."

"I'm fully aware of what they were laughing at.  I was 13 and just figuring out things."

Dorian chuckled.  It was almost a giggle.  I looked back at him as he continued his plight of laughter.  We walked into the next classroom.  Margarette flipped on the light and it was an elegant ballroom filled with luscous curtains and no mirrors.  I walked over to the record player that would fill the whole room with music.  "We aren't exactly dressed to impress Dorian. But.." I turned the record player on and a slow waltz started playing.  I held my hand out to him and asked, "Do you want to dance with me?"

"You can waltz?"  

I nodded as I closed the distance between us until I was standing in front of him.  "I can waltz, mambo, salsa, cha cha, foxtrot and tango among many others."

Margarette smiled.  "Here.  Let's show him."  She took my hand and wisked me away in her leotard and me in my jeans.  It wasn't going to look luxurious but it was still fun to dance.

I warned.  "I'm a little rusty."

We danced and the only thing I could think about was wanting it to be Dorian.  He tapped Margarette on the shoulder.  "I think I got it now."

She smiled and left us alone in the room with the music playing.  I fell into the female position and let Dorian lead.  He looked at me and smiled.  "I expected an arguement."

I laughed.  "I learned both parts because most men don't, and I like to dance Dorian.  I always have.  And since I like men, we both can't do the same thing with each other."

He kissed me softly and we danced around the dance floor.

We lost track of time.  I was in the middle of showing Dorian the jive when my phone went of in several rapid text message.  I looked at him, "You turned my phone back on."

He looked a little guilty.  "I didn't want you to have a panic attack if something came through and you didn't know about it later.  I'd forgotten I'd done it honestly."

He took it out of his back pocket and handed it to me without even looking at the text on the front screen.  I smiled.  "I would have been alright."

Dorian nodded.  "I wouldn't have been.  I could easily prevent it."

I glanced at it and was surprised to see that particular name on my phone now.  It was still daylight.  It read.  "Emergency.  NYC meeting place - now!"

I turned the phone to Dorian.  "I have an emergency to attend to.  Do you want to go for a walk with me?  This could be construed as me breaking my no field work regiment."

Dorian nodded.  "Will you stop if I tell you to?"

I nodded.  "If it's dangerous, yes.  I'll listen Dorian.  My care is in your hands right now."

He took me by the hand.  "Lead the way then."

I found Maragette teaching the class and left the fee for the use of the studio on the desk by the door.  She nodded and waved and the girls all giggled as we left the studio.

We were down in the subway tunnels about to get on the train.  "We are going to meet a vampire."

Dorian's eyes were wide.  "Okay.  Why?"

"Ant says there is an emergency.  And if he's in NYC that means Il Cane is as well and that can be a problem with the local vamps."

"Il Cane is in New York.  How do you know?"

"Ant is her son.  He rarely leaves her side.  He's either a scout, on a mission for her, or she's here, eithre way when the Son of the Hound says there is an emergency I listen."

"How do you know him?"  Dorian sounded a little distant and jealous.

"I hunted his mother on my first Hunt.  It was a big joke to most, but I took it seriously.  Instead of finding Cari, I found Ant and Ryan.  Every couple of years I hunt her down and Ant and I have a few drinks."

"And?"  Dorian asked.

I smiled.  "Yes.  Dorian.  I've slept with him once or twice.  But I haven't in over three years.  And I've seen him three times over those years."

"Why did you stop?"

I shrugged.  "Out grew it?  I don't know honestly.  He'd feed and that was that.  We'd have a few drinks, chat about his mom and Ryan.  I think he had a girlfriend or wife or whatever the primeval vamps call their mates.  It's not serious."

"And this emergency?"  Now he really sounded jealous.

"He wouldn't say there is an emergency if he wanted to have sex.  He wouldn't even call me if that's what he wanted.  We only slept together because he can't turn off the lust while feeding.  I got carried away, and he fell into the rythm of it all easily because I didn't give him much choice in the matter."

"Nox... I don't"

"This is our stop."  I took Dorian's hand and dragged him out of the train.  "Look Dorian.  I'm not going to lie to you about any of my past.  I don't want there to be secrets or lies.  Ant and I had sex.  That's all it was.  There are a lot of people who I've had sex with."  I stepped closer to him and whisepred in his ear.  "But there is no one in the entire world who has ever made me feel what I feel for you.  You brighten my day.  You brighten my nights.  I don't want or need anyone but you."

Dorian pulled away from me a little and nodded towards the wall at the man staring at us.  I smiled at him then back at Dorian.  "That's Ant."  I let go of his hands.  "Are you okay?"

Dorian sighed.  "I'm still getting used to you and your past."

I nodded.  "I'd take it all away if I could Dorian.  Make it so that it never happened.  Be that young naive little boy and let you show me the ways of the world, but that isn't going tohappen.  I love you here and now and that's all I need."

Dorian smiled. "You love me?"

I looked down and laughed before I looked up at him with a smile. "You heard that huh?"  I stepped forward put my hands on Dorian's wrists and kissed him softly.  "I love you Dorian."

He was beaming at me as he put his hand on my waist and turned me to walk to the vampire who was paitently waiting for our public display of affection to end.## Frame Up

Ant was the classi tall, dark and handsome.  His build was that of a weight lifter and his t-shirt didn't quite fit under the leather jacket he wore.  Dorian whispered, "He's cute."

I laughed, "You know he can hear you right?"

Dorian blushed slightly.  "No I didn't."

Ant offered his hand to Dorian.  "Antony Giovanni.  I didn't exptect Nox to bring his ... boyfriend?"

I smiled.  "We were spending the day together, didn't want to end it because you called.  This is Dorian Vega."

"Ah.  The name I know."

"You've heard of me?"  Dorian asked.

"Nox likes to talk.  A lot."  Ant smiled.  "But I'm sure you know that."

Dorian nodded knowingly.  I asked.  "What's the emergency?  I didn't even know you knew I was back."

Ant started walking from his leaning position down the subway platfrom to the employee's only.  I threw up a veil so we'd not get as many eyes, but the place was rather empty as it was.  

Dorian looked behind us and frowned.  "This isn't illegal is it?"

Ant shook his head.  "No, but the person I need Nox to talk to isn't a fan of the daylight even underground."

"And you aren't?"  Dorian asked.

"He's an old vampire and a daywalker."  I smiled.  "Though newly aquired, if the rumors are true.  Your mother must be freaking out."

Ant shrugged, "Cari is learning much slower than I am.  She's a creature of the darkness.  And Ry is helping the best he can.  But how do you teach a vampire that the light doesn't hurt you anymore when it has for centuries."

"I guess the same way you tell someone they are immortal."

Dorian choked on that.  "Yeah let's poison you so you don't die."

I squeezed Dorian's fingers in mine.  "We'll deal with that later.  Vampire emergencies - Il Cane in town.  This takes priority over my stupid life."

"Nox.." Dorian cut off as he saw a man standing in the darkness, his skin white as chalk with glowing red eyes.  It was a trick of sorts.  

I rolled my eyes.  "Marco, stop.  You aren't a demon and I'll sliced your head off if you try it again.  I won't share anything anymore if you keep it up."

He pouted.  "Dorian.  Marco.  Marco my boyfriend, Dorian, you tease him in the slightest I'll have your head too."

His pout grew deeper and Ant smacked him up side the head.  "Act your age."

From the echos of the shadows a voice echoed in the tunnel.  "Boys all of you behave."

I knew that voice. "Bernstein.  Why have you called me here with these two numbskulls?"

Dorian's jaw dropped.  "You know the Bernstein vampire.  Our fathers..."

Bernstein stepped out in a long trenchcoat that fell nearly to his ankles, his hair was dark and pulled back at the nape of his neck.  I knew it ran to well past his waist.  "Your father's are the reason I call upon you, Venatori."

"You know my name." I said flatly.

He stepped out his dark brown eyes were nearly black in the dim light.  "Because I requested you and you came I will oblige.  Nox.  Your father is hunting me and mine."

I looked at Dorian and he nodded.  "My father and Kai have been hunting down a kiss of vampires that have been raising hell in the college frats and some of the local clubs.  All evidence points to the Bernstein vampire."

"But you aren't doing it are you?  You want me to stop my father."  I said.

"Not stop.  Talk to him.  Or let me speak to him in a safe place."

"What makes you think I have any weight with  my father?"  I asked.

"You do.  You are his son.  As Figilio Del Cane can persuade his mother to stay her hand."

I asked.  "The council thinks you are guilty too?"

Marco nodded. "They don't beleive it, but it is their policy to take care of their own before the Venatori get there.  Your father is close to finding our home.  We don't wish to move."

"Fine I'll see what I can do.  But I can't promise anything.  I would offer to bring you in and see a trial but we know how that goes."

Everyone nodded including Dorian.  Bernstein looked at Dorian for the first time.  "Why did you bring another with you?"

"We were on a date.  You interupted it."

He looked at me with curiousity.  "You are not the dating type.  Or the boys would have fled long ago."

I laughed.  "I've changed."

Dorian asked, "Both of them?"

I sighed and nodded. "Yes.  Never at the same moment in time.  I met Marco when I was young, he likes to play let's hurt the humans and I stepped in and offered myself instead."

Marco frowned.  "He's not quite as fun as I'd had hoped."

"Meaning?" Dorian asked.

"He was not quite filling his skin as he does these days.  Afraid and easily manipulated.  He's a better man now.  But not because of me.  Or Ant."

"Don't speak for me Marco."  Ant glared at him.

"Enough!" Bernstein shouted.  "I tire of your bedroom games.  Leave me."

Marco took Dorian my the arm and shifted him away from us while Bernstein left the area.  Ant shook his head.  "Do what you can, brother, and we'll do what we can.  He's an old cracky vampire but he's and his aren't behind the murders.  There is some other plot to separate the pacts of the Clandestine Providence.  Venatori hunting vampire will never end well.  Il Cane will not like it."

"I know.  but I better resuce Dorian from Marco.  I'll let you know what I can do."  Ant nodded and slipped into the shadows and disappeared.  I hated when he did that but I hated traveling that way even worse.

"Marco leave Dorian alone."

Dorian smiled.  "He was being a perfect gentleman though his tales are a little over the top."

"I'd say he was lying but he probably wasn't."  Marco grinned at me then stepped into the shadows himself and was gone.

"That's a neat trick."  Dorian said in awe.

"It's a gut wrenching experience."  I took Dorian's hand in mine.  "What did he tell you"

"Marco was regailing a tale of your first encounter.  An eleven year old boy standing up for a 20 something girl who was renigging on a deal."

"Did he tell you what he did to me?"

Dorian nodded.  "He did.  And he suggested I try it."

I shuddered and not in a good way.  "I trust you."

Dorian stopped  and took my hands in his.  "But it was number one on your list of rules."

I smiled at Dorian and nodded.  "I'm aware of that.  I trust you with everything, even my fears Dorian.  I don't suggest it be something we try soon, but yes I'd be willing."

I could see a certain spark in Dorian that hadn't been there before.  I knew he liked to play rough, I guess I didn't think he enjoyed it that much.  
## The Art of Persuasion

Dorian kissed me rather throughly without touching me anywhere else, it was like he didn't want to tempt himself.  I had a sudden surge of butterflies.  I never got butterflies when I was with someone.  Dorian must have sensed something and pulled away and rested his forehead against mine and pulled me close to him and whispered.  "You are much to nice sometimes, Nox.  I won't take advantage of you like that."

I brushed my lips against his softly as I whispered.  "You aren't taking advantage of me if I want you to."  I took his bottom lip between mine and bit softly and Dorian gave a small moan of pleasure.  "And I want you to."

I pulled away before we could fall farther down that rabbit hole.  "I need to talk to my father."  I grabbed Dorian around the waist and started walking back towards the exit.  "I'll walk you home."

Dorian smiled.  "I'm going with you.  You can't get rid of me now."

I nodded.  "It's boring."

Dorian laughed, "Nothing is boring with you."

I kissed him on the cheek as we walked out of the subway platform and head home.  My father hopefully would be easy to find.  If not we'd be looking around for a while.

Dorian held my hand against his hip as we walked back to the AU building.  There was a companionable silence but I knew Dorian had to be thinking about his latest revelation about me.  I had to know.  I asked, "Penny for your thoughts?"

I saw Dorian look at me with a grin.  "Just thinking about how I don't really know you.  And yet I feel that I do."

"Oh really?"  I smiled back at him.

"Your life before this moment was full of ..."  

He paused searching for a word - politically correct or something that I wouldn't take offense to so I offered a few suggestions, "sex? self-harm? abuse? diaster?"  I grinned at him.  "They made me who I am today.  I regret none of it.  Well maybe one thing."

Dorian stopped and turned me towards him.  "What do you regret Nox?"

I smiled at him. "Not saying anything to you about how I felt when I had the chance."

Dorian laughed.  "I wouldn't have been receptive then.  You had kissed Dylan.  You were flamboyout and excessively gay."

I started walking again as the light had changed.  "None of that has changed."

Dorian nodded.  "But I have.  Where before Dylan's opinion matter it does not now.  You being flamboyout is only a mask.  Same with the obession to look and act like an 80s sitcom feature the topic of the month, My son is gay."

I laughed at Dorian's assessment.  Not because it was funny but because he had hit the nail on the head.  Dorian continued, "None of that matters anymore.  You are a bright and intelligent young man who sees the world in a new light.  You were raised as one of us, you are one of us, but your reality was so different from ours you saw outside the box."

I shrugged.  "Such is life.  I'm glad I'm not a stain on your image."

Dorign grinned, "Now I never said that."  He pulled me into an alley way and pushed me up against the wall and kissed me furiously.  We parted breathless and I was weak in the knees.  "I love that you are the way you are.  I don't have to hold back."

I grinned at him and he took me by the hand and started walking again.  Dorian smiling happily as we entered the AU building still holding hands.  We held hands as we searched the building for my father which wasn't all that difficult, he was having dinner with Emilio at Dorian's parents apartment.

Dolores answered the door and I could hear my father laughing at something Emilio had said.  We were at the right place.  "Dorian!  I wasn't expecting you."  She was smiling with both her lips and her eyes and Dorian hugged his mother.  

I interrupted their family moment.  "I need to speak to Kai."

"Nox!"  She hugged me as well which I stiffened the moment she wrapped her arms around my back.

Dorian took my hand and pulled me past his mother whispering to her, "He's not a big hugger."

Which wasn't exactly a lie, touching like that was foreign and certainly not something I was used to, but Dorian had saved me as polietly as possible.  

"Father.  Kai."  Dorian smiled as he headed for the wine cabinet in the kitchen.  

"I need to talk to you off the record."  I told my father and Emilio.

Kai looked up at me with his deep brown eyes and frowned.  "About what?"

"Your vampire case."

Dorian handed me a glass of wine and I sipped.  Emilio nodded.  "Sit.  Relax."

I sighed.  "I have reason to beleive that you are closing in on the wrong vampires."

Kai asked, "Reason to beleive?  Some prophetic vision I don't know about?"

I shook my head.  "No.  Word from the source itself.  Bernstein contacted me..."

Kai's anger light up around him, fire coalesced into patterns outside of his body and I knew he could ignite things if he just thought it, but he was a trained fire-starter he could control it.  Just as I had been one, my father was one before me.  "You know the Bernstein vampire?"

I nodded.  "I know alot of vampires and were's.  They live in this city too you know."

Kai's anger only grew at my comment.  "And you let him live?"

I sighed.  "He didn't kill those people.  Nor did any of his kiss.  They are old, Kai.  They aren't going to screw up like that.  Marco and Bernstein rule with an iron fist and Desmond is the only one who is higher than they in this City."

"Marco?  Desmond?"  Emilio asked his hand on my father's shoulder calming him down, or at least keeping him from ripping me apart.

"Desmond is the council member who makes his home here.  He is one of three in the new world.  This is all vampire lore, things you should know.  And Marco is like a moth to flame, he seeks out individuals to work with behind the scenes.  He's been party to many kings and queens ascentions as well as their down falls.  Again vampire lore."

It was Dorian who asked, "And you know Desmond."

I nodded.  "I've met him once.  Ant introduced us when I was hunting a vampire here who tried to make it a safe haven under Desmond's eyes.  Desmond gave me his head as proof he was dead."

"And let me guess by Ant you mean the son of Il Cane - Antony Giovanni Jr?"

I nodded. "Yes."

Everyone in the room was blinking at me.  "And they still live?"

I shrugged.  "They've done nothing wrong.  No need to kill them or bring them in.  No different from you or I."

Kai got up and paced back and forth.  "You expect me to beleive a vampire over the evidence."

"No.  I expect you to do your job and find the responsible party.  Bernstein has agree to meet with you in a safe neutral location to discuss the problem."

Emilio nodded.  "We will meet with him.  Make the arrangements."

Kai was about to say something when Emilio glared at him and my father backed down.  He actually backed down and I was impressed at the way Emilio took charge of my father - a man I knew never let anyone tell him what to do.

I nodded.  Dolores poked her head into the living room from the kitchen.  "Dorian, you and Nox will stay for dinner?"

Dorian looked at me and nodded.  He smiled back.  "Yes, Mother.  We will stay for dinner.  So long..."

Dorlores was already out of the kitching grabbing my hand, "Then come Nox, you can help me."

I looked back at Dorian as his mother dragged me into the kitchen, he smiled and shrugged.  I had no other choice.  "Yes, ma'am."
## More Confessions

I think the absence of my presence called down my father.  I could hear him sqwacking about who I knew vampires and how things had to be different in my head.  It wasn't until Dorian stepped into the kitchen bearing his empty wine glass in hand that I realized it was a bit stressful for Dorian too.

Mrs. Vega had me chopping vegetables into thin slices.  She refused to tell me what she was making.  Dorian sat down at the bar and watched as I sliced carefully through the squash.  He was sipping at another glass of wine, actually I think it was my glass.  I grinned across the bar at him.  

"So Mother, what are we having for dinner?"

She turned and gave him a look that said none of his business before she started back to her prep work.

"She isn't saying.  I think she's afraid our fathers will overhear and run away."

Dorian glanced back at our fathers who were in a hushed conversation.  "You may be right."

Dorian poured another glass of wine and his mother laughed, "Dorian, enough."

"He's had a stressful day, he's good.  I'll make sure he gets home safely."  I grinned at him and Mrs. Vega sighed.

"How stressful can his day off be?"

I smiled.  "He's with me.  I can be rather stressful."

"I find that hard to beleive.  Such a quiet young man."

Dorian snorted.  "You really don't know Nox very well."  Dorian tapped his fingers against the wine glass, the tips of his fingernails pinging the crystal at a very annoying frequency before he sipped again and then continued.  "The hair and makeup are the smallest aspects of his atmosphere."

Mrs. Vega laughed, "Darling.  It is why you are so attracted to your complete opposite.  He flaunts who he is - you do not.  He is proud of the man he is.  Dorian we both know that you are always trying to prove yourself to us because you feel we do not approve of your choices.  Which has never been the case.  We are proud of you and love you for the man that you are.  Nox is only showing you it's okay to be what you are."

"And what am I mother?"  He sounded angry at her for bringing up his insecurities.

I answered for her.  "The love of my life, Dorian."

His eyes went big and he stared at me as I smiled down at the vegetables I was cutting.  When I looked up he was still staring at me.  "What?"  I asked.  I knew the question and he didn't have to answer.  "I know, too much, too soon.  But it's the truth Dorian.  You don't have to feel the same way.  And I won't be upset if it ends before it begins, but there is no one in this world who feels like home more than you do."

Mrs Vega had silenetly left the kitchen as I was speaking and Dorian was still staring wide eyed at me.  "I dreamt about you in my coma.  I know when you are around.  You comfort me just by being in the same room.  I couldn't imagine a life where I can sleep through the night until I met you.  I'm not telling you this to scare you away or to expect things to change.  But I'm willing to do what you need me to do to protect your image, to be the man behind the curtain who isn't your lover by day.  I can do anything for you you just have to tell me."

Dorian smiled at me and came around the counter and turned me to face him.  He leaned in and kissed me softly before he whispered in my ear, "You are perfect just the way you are.  And I'm not going anywhere."

I pulled Dorian close to me and wrapped my arms around his waist but he pushed me away playfully.  "I'm going to go find something else to do."

I pouted and Dorian laughed as he left, his mother coming in through the door he was leaving.  She was smiling at me.  "Thank you for that."

I smiled at her.  "It's the truth, but you are welcome."

She walked over and stood by me scopping up the cut vegetables and placing them into a bowl.  "He's always tried to hide his feelings.  If it weren't for Todd we'd probably still wondering why we had no more grandkids."

I laughed, "Well I will change that I hope."

I watched her raise her eyebrow.  "That serious?"

"Well it's the reason I came home.  To start a family."

"Does Dorian know?"

I shrugged.  "We've not discussed it completely but I think he knows.  It's not like we don't have obligations to fullfil."

Mrs. Vega placed a casserole dish into the oven and then looked over at me as I stood against the bar in the middle of the kitchen.  "And this doesn't bother you?"

"Does what bother me?  Having sex with a woman?  I like women.  I like men.  If you mean if it bothers me that Dorian would be with someone else, then yeah a little, but there are ways to enjoy that as well.  And I honestly think Dorian would have a better time if I were with him too."

The older woman blushed at my very open talk about sex with my boyfriends mother.  I grinned at her.  "I don't intend to hurt your son in the process, but that obligation isn't going to go away because I'm with Dorian."

"I guess you are right."  She smiled.  "It's not quite so easy for Dorian.  Though he does have a son."

I grinned back at her, "And he's great.  You need anymore assistance?"

She laughed.  "No Dorian went to his room, first door on the right down the hall."

"Thanks."  I gave her a small flourishing bow.

My father was talking with Emilio and I overheard a little about their vampire business.  I stopped in front of the partially open door and knocked softly as I pulled out my phone from my back pocket.  Dorian called out.  "Come in."

I pushed the door open and he was staring at the far wall staring at the posters of his childhood.  He smiled.  "My mother dismiss you?"

I smiled.  "Something like that."  

I found Ant's number in my phone and texted him that my father would be open to a neutral meeting place.  I then slipped it back into my back pocket and saw Dorian watching me.  I glanced around Dorian's room with a grin.  "Not exactly what I expected.  I expected more greys and blacks and stark white walls, not glam band posters, and sycadellic artwork."  Dorian chuckled as I picked up the  nail polish sitting on his desk which apparently doubled as a vanity because there was other various makeup neatly placed as if had never used them and it was for show.  But I knew Dorian had worn makeup as a teenager.   Nothing blatent but enough I had noticed.

I picked up a saphire blue bottle of nail polish and shook it and grinned, it hadn't gone sticky with time yet.  Which made me wonder if Dorian or his mother replaced them. I could feel Dorian watch me as I opened the bottle and the familiar scent of nail polish wafted up.  I applied it to my left thumb in three deft strokes.

Dorian sat down on his bed still watching me apply the nail polish to my left hand.  He was chuckling softly to himself. "You've done that before."

I turned the chair to face him and smiled.  "Of course.  It looks horrible after a few days so I don't bother."

Dorian stood up and handed me a clear bottle.  "That's why I still use this."

I grinned.  "I know."

I blew on the polish on my left hand as Dorian grabbed the bottle and my right hand.  "It matches the color in your hair."

I smiled.  "I know."

"You gonna keep saying that."

I laughed.  "I know.  But that doesn't make any sense what so ever."

Dorian painted each nail delicately.  I watched him holding my hand in his and his steady hand.  "You are good at this."

Dorian looked up at me with a grin.  "I'm out of practice."

"It's like riding a bike."

"Oh?"  Dorian asked.

I just smiled back at Dorian.  We talked about the past and things we liked then and how much we had in common back then and we'd never really known.  And then Dorian added, "I never thought I'd find a guy I liked enough to bring home or to my room.  Hell, it was never even a possiblity.  I had every intention when I was younger to find a girl I liked just enough and marry her and have kids - the perfect family."

"You still can if that's what you want."  I said with a smile.

He shook his head.  "No.  If there is one thing I've learned these past few months is t hat I wouldn't be happy then.  Not like I am happy with you."  He shook his head again lost in thought.  "I just don't know how this is going to work."

I asked, "What?"

"You and me, our obligations."

I smiled.  "We can share our bed Dorian.  At least long enough to meet our obligations.  I have more than enough suitors, I'm sure we could reach an agreement for you as well."

Dorian was the same color his mother had turned at the same general comment I'd made to her.  He shook his head.  I got up from the chair I'd been sitting in and pushed Dorian's chest and he laid back, his head propped up on the wall behind him, his hands behind his head, as I sat on his hips and placed my hands under his arm pits and leaned down close enough to kiss him and spoke "We can make this work in all ways Dorian."

Dorian leaned up and caught my bottom lip between his teeth and bit softly and a small moan left my mouth as he kissed me.  Our mouths were the only things we were touching, our tongues dancing inside exploring and eliciting small sounds from one another.  ## Family Dinner Interrupted

There was a gasp at the door and there was a small giggle.  I looked behind me at the door to see Sahara and her daughter staring at us in the doorway.  Sahara looked angry, but her daughter was covering her mouth to hide her laughter.  I looked down at Dorian and he was bright red.  I laughed softly as I stood back up and moved towards the door and knelt down to the giggling girl and I lent my hand out to her.  "Hi.  I'm Nox."

She giggled and took my hand and shook softly, "I'm Misha."  

I raised her hand to my lips and smiled as I kissed her third knuckle.  "It is a pleasure to meet you Misha.  I take it it's time to eat."

She nodded emphatically and grasped my hand firmly and dragged me past her mother.  I stood up and slowed our walk out the door long enough.  "A pleasure Sahara.  I'd greet you properly but I don't have much choice right now."

Misha dragged me to the dinning room, "Gran, He's sitting next to me."

Mrs. Vega looked over at me and I smiled with a wink.  She looked back down at her grand daughter.  "I don't think Dorian will appreciate you stealing his boyfriend."

Misha dragged me towards a smaller table in the kitchen.  I pulled out a chair for Misha and she sat down like any princess should and I sat down next to her folding myself into the small chair easily.  There was a guffaw from the living room as my father glanced at me and rolled his eyes.

Dorian stepped into the kitchen, "You can sit here Nox, I'm sure Misha will understand."

I grinned at him.  "I'm alright."

He came in and kissed me on top of the head.  "Always flirting."

I looked up at him mouthed, "I love you Dorian."

He leaned down and kissed me softly, "I love you."

My heart soared as I watched Dorian take a seat on the opposite side of the table, I knew it was so he could watch me with the kids.  Misha wasn't the only one, there were two little boys.  Misha introduced them.  The boy to her right was her brother, "Lyle, this is Nox."

I offered him my hand and he shook it firmly and I pretended like he had a strong grip which made the boy smile brightly.  "My cousin, Eli."

The boy corrected her, "Junior."

I smiled.  "A pleasure, Junior.  I'm Nox."  I offered him my hand and he stuffed his fork in his mouth and ignored me.

Lyle and Misha told me all about the Vegas.  All about Gran and Papa's house, how they played hide and seek and capture the flag in the bedrooms.  My phone beeped at me and I pulled it out of my pocket and read the text and nearly froze when I saw who it was from.  

Eli Junior took my phone from my hand and threw it across the room.  "No phones at the table."

His father yelled at him from the dinning room table.  "We do not that son."

I shook my head. "It's alright, he's right."  I bowed my head in apology.  "I'm sorry."

The boy smiled and started chatting with his cousins.  The three of them were having a grand time telling me all about Dorian's childhood pictures.  They were describing them in great detail - particularly giggling over a boy wearing makeup.  Until I calmly informed them, "I wear make up."

I dazzled them with my fingernails and Misha giggled as she looked at them.  "You are a girl too."

I laughed. "No.  I'm far from a girl.  I just like boys."

Lyle wrinkled his nose and said, "Ewwww.  You've kissed Uncle Dorian?"

I smiled. "Yes, I have."

Misha looked at me with a stare that said she wanted no lie from me.  "Have you kissed any girls?"

I nodded.  "A few."

"And you like it?" Lyle asked.

"Yeah."

All three children said at the same time, "Kissing is gross."

I laughed.  "It can be messy, but you'll understand when you are older."

Lyle shook his head.  "I'm never going to kiss anyone other than my Mommy and Daddy."

"That's perfectly acceptable as well."

Sahara's husband who I'd not met yelled from the dinning room, "Lyle and Misha you make sure you eat all your vegetables."

From the looks on their faces they didn't like them.  I looked over at the adults at the table and only Dorian was watching me his mouth and I knew his smirk were hidden by his wine glass as I took the kids plates and scraped their vegetables to my plate with a finger to my lips.  Misha giggled and Lyle smiled widely.  Junior handed me his plate and I did the same.

My plate was filled with tons of vegetables and the kids giggled as I ate them all.  When my plate was empty Misha asked, "Momma, can we go play now?"

Sahara looked at the children's plates and nodded. "Yes, but no running in the house."

Misha and Lyle each of them grabbed one of my hands and pulled me to standing position and Eli shoved me in the direction they wanted to go.  "I'll go with you.  Just a second though, please?"

The nodded and looked up at me and I walked into the dinning room and took the wine glass from Dorian's hand took a swallow before handing it back to him and leaned down to whispere in his ear.  "Garrett knows I have what he wants.  He wants to meet."

Dorian took my hand that was on his shoulder.  "What did you tell him?" he said outloud.

"Nothing. Your nephew chucked my phone."

Dorian chucked.  "Junior?"  The boy looked over at Dorian.  "Can you get Nox's phone for me?"

He blushed slightly and nodded and hurried around the bar into the living room where he fetched my phone and handed it to me.

"Thanks."  I glanced at the number of texts that got worse the longer I didn't answer him.  I showed Dorian.  He took the phone from me and typed in the response. [i]Stop by Dorian's place in an hour.  I'll have what you want.[i]

"You didn't have to do that."  I said.

Dorian smiled.  "I know love.  I'm not going to let you do this alone."

Misha and Lyle tugged at my shirt, "Come one, let's play."

I nodded.  "Alright.  I have 30 minutes, then we have to go."  Dorian nodded and I kissed him softly on the lips and winked at him before leaving to follow the children into the living room.  

I heard Mrs. Vega say, "He's so good with children Dorian.  Maybe waiting has been good for you."

I chuckled to myself as Dorian tried to wave off the topic of conversation but he was failing miserably as everyone else got in on it.  I focused my attention back to the children.  They wanted to play video games.  Junior and Lyle were annoyed that I was better than them at it.  "You are so old" Lyle said, "How didja get so good."

I laughed.  "I shoot cross bows on a regular basis."

"That's not fair."  Junior said.

They stopped the game and piled on top of me and tried to tickle me.  I was ticklish when the right people did it but kids were always a bit too rough and it didn't work so well.  I ticked them back and then Misha joined in and the boys started ganging up on her so I took her side and protected her from the boys.  

We wound up giggling on the floor with the three of them fighting around me and using me as balancing beam.  I enjoyed the play time.  

Time flew by as I noted Dorian standing above my head with a grin. "You ready?"

I nodded and sat up with the kids still clinging to me.  I wrapped the three of them into a giant hug.   They were all stronger than I was but I held them easily enough.  "I gotta go.  Maybe we can spend some more time playing next weekend?"

Misha giggled.  "It's a date."

I laughed.  "We'll see alright.  I don't know what's on my plate yet."

Dorian offered me a hand and I took it.  He pulled me into a standing position and against him and I grinned.  "Shall we?"

Dorian kept my hand in his as he stepped into the dining room where the table was clear.  "We need to go.  Mother dinner was delicious."

I smiled at them.  "Thank you for allowing me to join your family dinner."

Mrs. Vega stood up and shook my hand.  "Our pleasure, Nox.  Next week you can cook for us?"

I smiled.  "Yes, ma'am.  I will make sure to rearrange my schedule if things conflict."

Dorian explained, "Everythings on his calendar."

Eli snorted from the other side of the room, "Everything?"

Dorian blushed.  "I suppose not everything."

I laughed.  "Oh I could.  Though since it's a public calendar, I don't think anyone would appreciate it."

Sahara asked, "Why a public calendar?"

"Because too many people need acess to it.  Only certain people can rearrange it, but it's easier that way.  It makes my life easier.  I'm not big on the surprises.  But we really need to go, not enough time to explain my annoying quirks."

Dorian chuckled and wrapped his arm around my waist, "Until next week family."## The Last Request of the Demon

We left Dorian's parents place and walked the three flights of stairs down to his apartment and went inside where Dorian pulled out a beer out of the fridge and handed it to me.  I grinned at him as I saw the Red Irish label sticking out under his hand.  "Have you been asking about me again?"

Dorian blushed slightly.  "No.  Well maybe a little.  But I didn't ask Jason what you liked to drink."

I took a step into Dorian and popped the top of the bottle with a pattern of air and took sip and savored the flavor.  "What exactly did you ask him then?"

He looked up at me with a smile of his own.  "What would make you more comfortable while you were at my place."

"And he suggested Irish Red?"  I asked.

Dorian blushed.  "That wasn't his first suggestion."

I raised an eyebrow.  "And that was?"

"He said if I wasn't always so formal - suggested taking off my clothes."  Dorian chuckled, "Which I took a little to literally to which he had a fit of laughter over my embarassement before he amended his statement.  If I was comfortable you'd be comfortable.  He said don't touch his back unless invited and always keep Irish Red on hand, he doesn't like wine too much."

"I'm getting a taste for it."  I continued in a whisper, "You can do anything to me without being invited Dorian."  Dorian kissed me eagerly just as there was rap at the door and Dorian sighed.

I froze and Dorian noticed.  He took me by the hand and lead me to the living room. "Sit on the couch.  I'll get the door."  I followed his instructions and Dorian went to answer the door.

I heard Garrett's voice over the blood rushing in my ears.  "Dorian Vega.  It's been a while.  I assume you know why I'm here."

"Come in."  I heard the door shut behind Dorian and their footsteps falling on the tiles in Dorian's apartment.  

Dorian sat down next to me and I fished the paper I'd folded up in my pocket and after Garrett sat down on the chair  nearest the door I set it down on the table.  "That's what you asked for."

Garrett picked it up and looked it over.  "Such neat handwriting.  No one would supsect you were queer."

I rolled my eyes at him but I said nothing.  Garrett laughed and took it further.  "You never were good at hiding that aspect from anyone."

"I wasn't trying to hide."  I bit back.  "I like who I am."  I sat forward and leaned my elbows against my knees as I stood up to Garrett for the first time in my life.  What was wrong with me.  Dorian's hand on my knee was a comfort and gave me strength to stand up to him.  "I like men.  I do not like you."

Garrett laughed.  "The boy does have a spine.  How very unusual.  Maybe your pretty boyfriend here is actually good for you."

"Leave him out of this."

"If you wanted him left out of this then you shouldn't have invited me over here."  Garrett slide forward.  "Now I want you to do something else for me."  Garrett put the paper back on the coffee table.  "You will take this list and you will kill Mark Green for me."

He grinned evilly and I could feel Dorian freeze with his hand against my knee.  "You will do it, or your precious pretty boy and his little red-headed ex-lover and his son will pay the price."

Garrett didn't try to hide the patterns of air he created.  They were intermingled with air and earth.  "It seams you are a rather intelligent young man.  I've learned a lot listening to your lectures as of late."

My heart caught in my throat.  Twice now something I've done has given bad people an advantage.  Garrett's weave of air and earth dangled closely to Dorian and he stood his ground staring at them himself.  Garrett laughed.  "You see the boy isn't lying."  Garrett stood up and walked to the door.  "You have two weeks.  And I'll be taking Stella and Aidan away on an extended vacation.  I will be having a grand time with your family Dorian.  She is a feisty one.  And the boy's flesh is so very tender."

Dorian moved to get up but I caught him with a weave of air as he stood up.  I knew he was angry.  I knew he would try to hurt Garrett and Garrett would win this battle.  Dorian turned to glare at me as Garret left the building.

Dorian looked at me. "Why did you stop me?"

I didn't look at him.  "I didn't want him to hurt you."  I buried my face in my hands and I could feel the tears of anger tricking down my cheeks.  

I felt Dorian sit down next to me and took my chin in his hand and turned me to look at him.  He wiped the hot tears from my cheeks and chuckled, "You are ruining the makeup again."

I smiled at him.  "I'm sorry you are involved in this."

Dorian sighed.  "I wouldn't be anywhere else."  He wrapped his arm around me shoulder and pulled me against him and leaned back against the back of the couch craddling me in his lap.  "What are you going to do?"

"I don't know know."  I sounded hopeless.  The situation was hopeless.  If I didn't do it then Dorian would get hurt in more ways than one, but then if I did I would be no better than the rogue monsters we hunt.  Though with in our own rules I could legally challenge Mark and then I'd be a puppet to whatever agened Garrett and his crew were after.

"I suppose I should go to Mark Green and tell him and deal with whatever consequences."

I could feel Dorian nodding.  "I will go with you."

"No Dorian, I will deal with this on my own.  If you are found to know about this they could exile you or worse.  I can't do that to you."

He sighed, "You know that's what he wants.  For you to protect me.  Even in this.  Nox, I could help."

I shook my head.  "No love you can't.  You will reap nothing but the horrors of my life."

Dorian held me in silence for the better part of hour while I sulked in his lap.  He kissed the top of my head.  "You should tell him sooner rather than later.  Go now, and then come back to me Nox."

He pushed me into a sitting position and took my chin in his hands and kissed me throughly.  When he pulled away he spoke softly.  "Promise me we'll deal with this together.  Tell Mark Green, and whatever he says we will deal with together."

I nodded, knowing that if I were thrown into the courts or into to exile I might not get a chance to come back to Dorian.  "But..."

Dorian shook his head.  "Even if you are exiled Nox for this, you will call me as soon as possible.  I want you to say it."

I sighed.  "I promise whatever happens we'll deal with this together."

Dorian stood up and offered me a hand and helped me up.  He wiped away my tears with his thumbs and smiled.  "You are at least presentable.  Now go before I follow you."

I followed my orders and I headed to the top floor where Mark Green and Asher Eriksen kept their residences.
## Going To The Big Man

I walked slowly stalling.  I was regretting telling Dorian not to come with me I could use his strength and his calm.  My anxiety was ratching up a notch each floor I walked up the stairs.  I only managed three flights of stairs before I had to stop and catch my breath because I couldn't breathe.

I took the door at the landing and used the elevator to the top floor.  My panic didn't die down, but at least it wasn't ratcheting each step I took.  I closed my eyes and stayed in the back of the elevator until I was alone on the last floor before the penthouse.

The doors dinged open and I stepped out into the lobby of the penthouse.  It was posh and plush with a few ways to go.  Normally I'd go to the left to the roof, but today I had to go into the residences.  I'd never been there, but everyone knew where Mark Green lived.  And I walked slowly through the golden tiles on the floor.  Everything looked rich and regal.  It was how the leader of the Venatori and our primary funding chose to live - in the lap of luxury.  I rolled my eyes at the thought.

Mark's door was inlaid with a carving in each panel - a great grand door made of oak from the look of it.  I knocked.

I waited for several minutes before an old balding man answered the door and I nodded an informal bow.  "I need to talk to you, sir."

"I know you beleive in making appointments.  So why are you here?"  Mark Green's voice was solid and unwavering and I could hear the hint of irony in it.

"It can't wait, sir."

He stepped aside and lead me to his sitting room.  It was a large library like room - lined with books and a few chairs in a circle in the middle of the room.  Our illustrous leader took a seat in a high backed plush chair made with crushed velvet in a plum color.  Very throne like if you asked me.

I took a less posh chair as required of my station and Mark Green smiled slightly at the gesture.

I took a deep breath.  "I was approached for something unthinkable."

The gray eyes of the man who'd once sent me away so I didn't have to deal with the procreation decree right away were curious.  I could see the tiny lines at the edge of his eyes crinkling with amusement.  "And what was that?"

"I was asked to get your current schedule for the next two weeks, and today I learned that I was to kill you in those two weeks."  I said flatly.  There was no need to hide anything under subtrefuge.

He raised his hand and three security guards stepped out of their hiding spots and I laughed as I leaned back in the chair with my hands up in the air.  "You all know I could have killed him the moment opened the door right.  I know you are aware of my knack for using my ability faster than most individuals."

Mark Green nodded.  "Oh they aren't here for you.  If I were worried Nox.  I wouldn't have opened the door."

"So what are they here for?"I waved my hands at his bodyguards.

He sighed.  And one of the guards handed him a folder.  "Various things.  This is the information you have recently accessed.  None of it of much use except that you looked at my schedule today.  It seems your record has been being perused by Dorian Vega as of late.  Why is that?"

I smiled.  "Because he was trying to learn more about me without asking me."

"Why would he do that?"

"Because we are seeing each other."  I said with a ironic grin.

Mark Green nodded.  "He is throrough."

I nodded.  "That's Dorian."

Mark nodded absently like he was lost in thought.  "I do not want you to talk anymore to me about this.  And I will not tell you of my plan that you have now become critical to.  You won't like this, but you are a good hunter and you will figure it all out.  When it's safe someone will find you.  But tomorrow you will do as you are asked.  In the morning when I go to eat breakfast in a near empty cafeteria you will come and throw a fireball at me.  Your weapon of choice correct."

I could only stare at him and he gave me a grim smile.  "There will be consequences, but they are necessary."  He continued.  "I will not tell you to not tell Dorian or your family what you are about to do, but I suggest you refrain from it least of all the wrong ears hear.  Someone will find you.  You will find that there is a new appointment in your calendar with a meeting with me about your progeny assignments.  Asher will be in touch."

A man took me by the arm and lifted me from the seat and Mark stood up and gave me a weak smile. "Good luck in the future, my boy.  I wish things could be different."

The only thing running through my mind as I was shown the door was What the fuck was going on.

I made my way to the elevator and rode it until the door dinged open on Dorian's floor and I stepped out still in a daze.  I was really going to do this...

I didn't remember walking to Dorian's apartment or even knocking on the door but I saw those beautiful blue eyes staring at me with saddness.  He pulled me inside and took me in his arms and hugged me tightly.  "I'm sorry Nox."

I blinked, "For what?"

"Whatever happened.  Whatever it is."

I pulled back and kissed Dorian thoroughly until we were both desparate for air.  I stepped away from Dorian and pulled him towards his bedroom.  Dorian's eyes went wide with concern but he followed me.  I locked the bedroom door behind us and pushed Dorian on to the bed he was still wearing jeans and a t-shirt and I liked the look of his disheveled hair splayed on the white comforter of his bed.  I crawled on top of him and kissed him like it was the last time I would do it forever.  And it likely was.  My heart sank as I kissed him and Dorian pushed me up to look at my face which I buried my tears in the side of his neck and bit and nipped at the place just under his ear I loved so much.  Dorian moaned softly in my ear.  

I whispered between kisses against his skin.  "Mark. Wants. Me. To. Try. To. Kill. Him."  I bit excesseivly hard to keep Dorian's attention on me and not my words.  He squirmed underneath me and used his strength to overpower me and rolled me over so he pressed my body to the bed and my hands over my head as he looked down at me.  He kissed me like it was the last time would.  

I could feel the implication in his breath on my neck as he spoke next. "You'll be killed," he whispered in my ear.

I shook my head and I kissed Dorian then whispered against his lips as I moved my hips underneath him and he let out a small moan, "He says someone will find me."

Dorian nipped at my lip and kissed along my jaw to my ear and just below he bit and sucked hard I could feel the blood rushing through my body and my body ached for the touch of Dorian's skin against my body.  He whispered against my neck, "He means to exile you."

I whispered, "He has a plan.  I don't know what it is, but he's giving me one more night with you.  Let's not waste it on worrying."  I wrapped my legs around Dorian and pushed myself into him as close as our clothes would allow.

Dorian nodded and kissed me; the rest was bliss.

# Part III: Exiled

## The End is Nigh

I didn't sleep at all when my alarm went off and not because I'd spent half of it making love to Dorian.  Something I had never done with anyone - sex yes, and I'd had sex with Dorian before but this was different.  It felt different.  After I'd turned off my alarm I rolled back over and buried my face against Dorian's body.  I didn't want to leave him.  But I had things to do.

I kissed Dorian on the temple and whispered in Dorian's ear.  "I love you."  He nuzzled my cheek and I left his bedroom probably for the last time.  I started a pot of coffee and found a peice of paper and left Dorian a note.

> Dorian
>
> I'm sorry to leave while you are a still asleep but I can't bear to see you sad.  I love you with all my heart.  I have to do what he wants.  I can't let him hurt you.  I will try to let you know I'm okay.
>
> I love you.
>
> Always, Nox

I poured myself a cup of coffee in a disposal cup Dorian had apparently purchased recently as the package was unopened, and I looked around Dorian's apartment with sorrow and headed for the door.  

My heart was racing as I went to my not so empty apartment, everything I'd bought earlier in the week had finally arrived and things were cluttering up the living room - boxes, furniture.  I sighed.  Good glad the Venatori had to pay for it!  

I grabbed my two bags that I'd still not unpacked yet and slung them over my back and headed for the elevator.  I was used to living out of my bags, and I wasn't going to be completely homeless before I did this.

I hit the first ATM in the lobby and pulled all my money from my account and stuck it in the bottom of my backpack.  Then I took my things across the street.  I opened the door to the 24 hour diner and was greeted with a jubuliant "Howdy" from Bonnie.  She looked up and saw the sadness on my face3 and frowned.  

Before she could try to comfort me I spoke quickly.  "Can I keep some stuff here for a little while.  It might be a few days."

She nodded and headed for the back room.  "Is everything okay?"

I shook my head.  "No ma'am it's not but not something I can or want to talk about."

Bonnie put her hand on my shoulder, "Did he break up with you?"

I looked at her confused.  "What?  No.  Dorian is great.  My life just fucking sucks.  Look I gotta go.  Thanks for this."

I was back out the door and heading back into the AU building.  I glanced at my phone and went to the common area where I was supposed to be in a few hours.  I took a seat with my coffee where I knew Mark Green would walk in from.  

It felt like more than a few hours, my coffee had gone cold untouched.  My body ached from the strain as I sat pretending to read on my phone.  I had read the same page for nearly an hour when Mark Green's first bodyguard stepped inside the room and nodded that it was safe.  At least he assumed it was safe.  The moment that Mark Green stepped through the double doors I stood up and created a fireball bigger than I had ever created and I threw it at him.  I could only pray he knew what he was doing.

I watched as the fireball crashed around Mark Green and then an impossible pain shot threw my body as the backlash hit me.  I screamed out in pain and fell to my knees just as two guards pulled me up from the ground by my arms.

Mark Green walked casually up to me with a small smile.  "Didn't expect that did you?"  I didn't say anything.  "Remove the tattoo from his temple and throw him out with only the clothes on his back.  Let's see how the would-be assassin can survive without his precious Venatori providing for his very existance."

One of the guards who hadn't been there with Mark Green protested.  "He tried to kill you."

Mark Green laughed.  "You don't think I know that.  I don't think he'll be trying that again.  I'm sure he'll think twice before throwing powerful spells out at people he doesn't understand."  Mark started to leave but he turned back to me.  "Oh and make sure it's a public exiling - we don't want others like him to get any more ideas."

My body shook with the pain that was still searing through my veins as he laughed at me and walked away.  I wasn't taken to any guard room I was dragged to the middle of the Venatori Headquarters command center and I was strapped to a chair I recognized from my Ad Aetatam.  They intended to cover the tattoo at my temple with a disgraced mark.  

The pain from whatever Mark had done to me still coursed through me as the fear set in.  When Ash finally arrived with her tattoo station I was in a near panicked state.  I couldn't focus on anything.  I could hear voices all around me, I could hear their whispers.  On the balcony looking down at me I saw Dorian standing staring at me with pain in his eyes.  I didn't know what was running through his mind, but my eyes ever left his as I saw Ash sit down out of the corner of my eye.  

I felt a knife cut my arm as she took blood for the ritural that would cover the magical tattoo on my temple.  Blood for blood.  During your Ad Aetatem you weren't allowed to be weak, I had no dilusions about my fear but I refused to let the Venator see my weakness.  I stared up at the blue eyes of the man I loved and I bit my bottom lip as Ash went to work to cover the pair of crossed swords.  The mark of a disgraced Venantori was variation on the Chinese symbols for exiled.

This tattoo differed from one given during your Ad Aetatem, not only could it be seen by anyone with supernatural powers but so could normal ordinary people.  It was meant to make you stand out.

I wanted to cry out in pain as the needle peirced my skin repeatedly but I didn't I just stared at Dorian biting my bottom lip and before Ash was done I could taste the blood in my mouth.  As Ash cleaned the tattoo area the screens all flipped and Mark Green spoke to the entirty of the Venatori.

"This man here has been exiled for his attempt at murder.  I am lienant on him because he is only a pawn in the story.  Someone is coming after me and the boy here is only a casuality of this war.  He is no longer one of us.  He is weak and shall be despised by all.  Any who help him shall find a similar fate awaits them.  Nox Setanta I exile you to the mundane world for evermore."

A cheer went up and two guards pulled me from the chair and dragged me to the elevator and out threw me out into the public area of the AU building, but not before I felt a large hand slip something into my pocket.  I stumbled on to the tile floors outside the elevator and turned to watch the doors close and the sneers of rejoice coming from the guards being the last thing I'd see of the Venatori.

Fuck!

I turned and walked out of the building and just kept walking.  I was so screwed.  I knew doing this was going to get me exiled with no hope of ever returning to the Venatori even if Mark Green had a plan I was in the dark.  I couldn't fathom why he'd let me go after I had tried to kill him, or what the hell he'd done to cause the backlash.  I tried to replay the episode in my head as I walked, but I saw nothing I hadn't seen before.  What wouldn't I give to have a photographic memory like Dorian.  Dorian...

I felt so lost and I just kept walking until the sun set.  I didn't even know where I was until I looked up and found myself standing in front of the AU building.  I wondered if I'd just been walking circles without realizing it.  Or was this my brains way of telling me to get my things.  I walked across the street and did just that.

When I entered Bonnie started her normal greeting until she looked up and saw me.  "Oh my, what happened to you.  She touched the tattoo on my temple.  Why on earth does that look so angry."

"Punishment.  Can I get my things?"

"No you will eat.  You look horrible."  She guided me to my corner spot in the back of the diner and had me a water and pumpkin pie without even asking me what I wanted she was back in the kitchen and before I knew it my usual sat on the table before me.  I hadn't eaten anything all day and I devoured the food.

When I was done she had my things sitting on the opposite bench.  "I think I understand now why you wanted these here.  You did something you knew would get you in trouble."

I only nodded and she sat down on the bench with my bags.  "Why did you do it Nox?"

"I had to."  I whispered.  I reached across the table for my backpack and pulled out some of the money at the bottom of my bag and dropped the cost on the table.  "I have to go now.  Thank you."

She looked at the money and as I stood up she snatched it from the table and stuck it in my pocket.  I pulled the money out seeing the note that was placed there earliery today.  I just started walking as I stared at the note.  I put it back into my pocket with the money as the door jingled shut behind me.## Back To the Old Ways

I caught a train down into a neighborhood I hadn't been in over ten years.  I hoped it was still as I remembered it.  Walking up from the platform brought back memories.  Jace holding my hand as he pulled me up the stairs the first time saying, "You'll love it I know you will."

I had loved it.  But my heart didn't feel it as I knocked on the familiar brown stone where loud music was pumping through at this late hour.  A man opened the door, his dark eyes taking me in, he rubbed his scruffy beard as recognition dawned on him and he smiled.  I asked, "Mind if I crash here tonight?"

Stephen reached around my shoulders and walked me into his apartment, "Anytime, mate."  Stephen was a displaced Aussie, he'd been her since I was a teenager - he wasn't much older than myself.  This was his brother's place.

He smashed the top of the stereo and the music cut of sharply and Stephen yelled, "Look who's gracing us with his presence."

The room turned to look at me and several faces smiled, the others turned back to what they were doing.  Gregory came up to me, Stephan's brother and shook my hand.  "Nox you are always welcome.  What no Jace?  I thought you two were insepearable."

"He's married you know."  As if that explained everything I needed to say.

Gregory took my things up the stairs, "You can crash with me."

I was about to protest as his long fingers snaked into mine and he tugged me after him.  "Come on, I'll show you the way."

I knew the way, it hadn't changed since my Ad Aetatem when I slept with him for the first and only time.  I sighed.  I hoped he didn't expect me to be the same person.

He dropped my bags on the floor and he smiled at me and shut the door behind him turning the lock before he sat down in the desk chair by his computer.  "You look like shit man.  I didn't think you'd want to be down there with them.  Even though I'm sure you could find a pick me up there."

I flopped down on his bed and sighed.  "Thanks."

Gregory asked, "What's wrong man?  Tattoo's different."

I sighed.  "Punishment."  Gregory and Stephen werewolves - had been one their entire lives.

He shook his head.  "What you do?"

"I'd rather not talk about it."  I sat up and looked at Gregory.  "But what is killing me is the fact that I'd found the perfect man.  Someone I wanted to be with, and now because of the shit things that have hapened in my life and the actions I took to protect him, I won't be able to see him again."

Gregory shook his head, "I can't see you with anyone long term.  Just not possible unless it was Jace."

"I don't love Jace like that."  I sighed.

"We all know that."  Gregory stood up and patted my knee as he headed for the door.  "I'm not looking for handouts.  You can stay here as long as you need, man."

I knew what he meant as he left and I closed my eyes as he flipped the lights off.  I drifted into a the bleakness of my own mind.  Instead of the red glowing eyes I saw images of my failure dancing in my head.  Dorian lifeless in his bed.  Aidan's throat cut and Stella screaming as Garrett forced himself upon her.  I opened my eyes and found the clock only a few hours ahead of where it had been before.

I got up and went downstairs. The thumping music was beating a hole in my memories and as I hit the bottom step I was enveloped in the familiar sights of my childhood.  In the kitchen people were playing drinking games, on the couch a few couples were making out.  There were the stoners getting high in the corner and Stephen was all over a girl.  Gregory sat in the back of the kitchen on the counter staring out over the crowd talking with a girl.  

I wound my way through the kitchen picking up a beer as I passed the table.  I got a weird look from the guy I'd taken it from but he didn't say anything as he took his friend's.  I took a sip and stood next to Gregory who had nodded at my approach.  The girl parted ways with a breif kiss on the check.  I laughed.  "Not your type?"

Gregory smiled.  "Plenty my type.  But that's Michael's sister she was updating me on his status."

"Dead in jail?"

Gregory frowned.  "How'd you know?"

I smiled.  "I heard her."

Gregory shook his head.  "Not surprised really.  He pisses off everyone he meets.  But he was loyal to a fault, never narc'd on Holly and that's who they were after."

"Holly was too smart to get caught.  Shame she got gunned down."

"Tis the life she lead and the drug lords she pissed off."  Gregory frowned then turned to look at me with a shy grin.  "Dance with me?"

I raised an eyebrow.  "You remember what I told you earlier, right?"  He nodded and smiled as he hopped off the counter and offered me his hand.  "Fine.  But I'm not sleeping with you."

I took his hand with my free one and he pulled me towards what was the make shift dance floor of his apartment.  He pulled me against his body and wrapped an arm around my waist.  I slung my empty hand over his shoulder and around his neck.  It wasn't the first time we'd danced together.  If it were anyone other than Gregory it might have been construed as prelude to somethng more to come, both of us let them think what they wanted.  I was sharing his bed tonight as it was.

I let my mind wander in the thrumming beat of the music and the feel of Gregory against me.  It was strange yet familiar, like I'd come home to an old friend.  Thoughts of Dorian filling my mind as I danced with Gregory in away I would never dream of dancing with Dorian.  Unless he wanted me to, that was.

I think Stephen filled my cup several times. I was feeling a little sloshed and hanging slightly from Gregory's body as he grinned down at me.  He was laughing at me.  "I don't think I've seen you lose control, this shit is really messing you up."

I glanced around and the party had vacated to wherever they went to next.  I could hear Stephen upstairs with his girl over the music but Gregory was still dancing with me.  I pulled away and frowned.  "I think your brother kept filling my cup."

"You were lost somewhere, barely even here with me."  He didn't sound offended.  "He's a lucky guy.  We can go to bed, or keep dancing."  He took the cup from my hand and smiled. "Though I think you've had enough."

I gave him a wry smile.  "You are very nice for me not wanting to be here with you."

Gregory laughed, "It's not like it's the first time I've filled a need for you."  He blushed furiously.  "I will always remember that."

I grinned playfully.  "I hope so. I was your first."

He rolled his eyes.  "My first fuck in the ass maybe."

I winked and kissed his neck.  "That's all I meant."  I whispered. "Thank you for understanding."

He pulled me closer our bodies pressed together tightly as he started moving again.  Dancing was comforting and Gregory knew it.  I don't know how long we danced into the night, but Gregory stopped with a yawn and took my hand and led me up the stairs and he crawled into bed stretching out luxuriously and patted the bed.  "I'll behave."

I sighed looking at the man below me and frowned.  He wasn't beautiful like Dorian was but he was comfortable.  I knew the swell of his back, the tease of his abdomen.  I could easily lose myself in him for one night.  I ran my eyes over his body wanting to touch him and swallowed hard.  In a lust filled whisper, "I'm not worried about you."

Gregory chuckled and patted the bed next to him.  "You love this guy..."

I interrupted, "His name is Dorian."

Gregory nodded and patted the bed.  "You love Dorian.  And you don't do anything half assed, so get your ass in my bed and go to sleep.  Dream of your beau and forget your worries for one night.  I won't let anything happen to you."

I doubted Gregory would be able to protect me from my nightmares but I laid down anyway with a man who was more than happy to be my friend.  Why could I be friends with so many supernatural creatures and hate my own people or them hate me?  ## The Note

I started awake as usual when I had a nightmare.  The clock on the nightstand next to my head read 8am.  I hadn't slept too long Gregory was still lying next to me, his arm wrapped protectively around my waist.  I unfurled from him and he rolled over with a grumble. "It's too early."

My head was aching.  I hadn't drank that much in a very long time.  I wasn't drunk, I didn't do anything stupid, but I felt it now.  I rummaged around on Gregory's desk and found some Tylenol and popped two pills into my mouth and swallowed.  I wrote Gregory a note that said I'd be back after my run.

I didn't bother changing clothes, there really was no point.  I could shower then change, laundry was going to be come an expense I could hardly manage.  This was going to be rough.

I went for my run and on my way back I stopped at a Star bucks and picked up four coffees and headed back to the brown stone.  It was a splurge I realized after I'd done it.  I was going to have to break the habit.

I knocked on the door and had to wait several times before a half naked girl wearing Stephen's shirt opened the door.  "We aren't interested."

I grinned at her.  "Gregory let me stay I just went for a run."

She looked up the stairs behind her when someone mumbled and stepped aside letting me.  "Coffee."  Stephan pulled a cup from the carrier and handed it to the girl then took one himself.

He grinned at me, "You and Gregs were quiet last night."

I winked at him.  "I don't kiss and tell."

He punched me in the shoulder and laughed.  I rolled my eyes, "We didn't do anything. I have a boyfriend."

His jaw dropped and exclaimed, "Shut up!"

I set the fourth cup on the kitchen counter and sipped at mine.  It tasted horrible, how had I gotten used to Dorian's expensive brand so fast.  But it was coffee.

I rummaged around in the fridge and found very little to cook for breakfast and sighed.  Coffee it would be.  That might become the staple of his life.

Gregory came stumbling into the living room as I sat down on the couch sipping my coffee.  He said, "I smell coffee."

I pointed to the cup on the counter.  "That's yours."

He grinned and picked it up then flopped down on to the couch his legs over mine as he leaned his head on the arm of the couch.  The girl commented, "They act like an old married couple."

Stephan laughed.  "So far from the truth it's funny."

Gregory handed me a peice of paper.  "This was on the bed when I woke up."

I took it and looked at it.  I recalled the hand in my pocket of the guard that workded for Mark Green.  I unfolded it and inside was  a series of numbers.  Date, time and a phone number.  It was in three days.  I sighed and tucked it back into my pocket.  It seemed I had a date.

There was a knock at the door and Gregory hopped up quickly, "I got it."

Gregory was speaking in a hushed whisper until he stepped back into the living room.   Followed by him was a very large hispanic man who was white smile was a great contrast against his golden skin.  I rolled my eyes.  "You called Adrian?"

"He's my Alpha I had to." Gregory said calmly.  Gregory blushed, "He's your Alpha too."

I stood up and offered Adrian my hand.  "Been a while."

"Thirteen years if I recall. A lot has changed since I let you go."  His voice was perfectly spoken English, when I'd first met him his words were always tinged with that awesome spanish accent but now I could hear the Brooklyn in him.  Adrian sniffed the air around me then looked at Gregory.  "But you are wrong.  I'm no longer his Alpha."  He looked at me, "You've grown into your power well.  I can smell the forest just under the campfire."

I raised my eyebrow.  "You aren't the first person to tell me that.  I was never part of your pack.  Why do I smell like a forest?"

Adrian sat down next to me I could feel part of my leg pinned under his much larger frame.  I didn't move but I knew I should.  He leaned in close and placed his nose against my neck and I could feel his breath on my neck.  "Dude, it's been a long time since we've done anything like this, mind if you tell me what youare doing."

"Smelling the wolf on you."  Adrian said with a growl.

"That was days ago."

He pulled back and looked at me with a stunned look.  "What was days ago?"

"I helped a little wolf change.  We were in the pschye ward together.  She would have hurt someone."

The relief was strong in Adrian's dark eyes.  "Whew, you didn't change.  I thought maybe..."

"That I was a werewolf?"  I laughed.

He shook his head, "It would have been a first.  But you've always smelled like forest to me underneat that smoke of the campfire."

Gregory nodded and sat down next to me, pulling me closer to him and wrapping his arms around me protectively.  "Me too."

"Really?"

Adrian smiled.  "This little wolf didn't hurt you?  She submitted to your will?"

"She didn't hurt me," I said flatly.  "She laid with me all night instead of howling or trying to reach the hunt."

Adrian shook his head.  "Only an Alpha can do that Nox."

"I'm not a werewolf."  I complained.

"Doesn't matter.  Something makes you smell like the forest and you are an Alpha.  I suspected it before I let you go.  It's why I let you go before you challenged me.  Habit I suppose.  You are not were and couldn't lead the pack."  Adrian smiled.  "Where is your pack now?"

"My pack?"

"The girl you helped.  I smell her on you."  Gregory said.

"Still in the pschye ward I assume.  I was going to call you Adrian, she needs a pack.  She can't stay in there.  Jo will hurt someone."

Adrian shook his head, "She has a pack.  I can talk with Dr. Silverman and get her released under your leadership but you are her Alpha since you helped her change and since you aren't a were it's hard to transfer that bond she created with you to another."

"How the fuck..."  I sighed.  "I hate this."

"You hate what?" Adrian asked.

"Being different.  Before I left my doctors decided posioning me to prove my immortality was a good idea."  I sighed and drank the last of my coffee burning the top of my mouth.  I tried to play it off but Gregory was snickering in my ear as I lounged against his chest.

"Immortality?"  Adrian asked.

"That's what they say.  I'd rather not test the theory."

Greggory laughed.  "But that could be fun."

I rolled my eyes which I knew he couldn't see.  "Yeah sure."

Adrian moved away from us on the couch and turned to face me and looked highly serious which frightened me just a little.  "Nox, tell me what's going on.  Why have you been exiled?"

"I'd rather not talk about it.  Nothing you can do about it.  I fucked up and now I have to pay the consequences."

Adrian shook his head, "You don't just fuck up Nox.  You never have, not once in the years I've known your skinny ass."

I stuck my tongue out at him.  "I tried to kill Mark Green to save my boyfriend, his son and the boy's mother.  I did it willingly, knowingly.  I was coheresed but the consequences could have been worse."

"You didn't succeed then, other wise you'd be leading the Venatori.  They've the same rules we do even if your lot doesn't follow it as stricktly."  Adrian said calmly.

I stood up and started pacing.  "I am part of some larger plan.  That's all I know.  I have a meeting in three days, phone call to make whatever."

Adrian leaned back, "Have you spoken to Marco yet about this?"

I shook my head.  "Why would I have talked to Marco?"

Adrian sighed. "There have been rumblings around the supernatural watercooler.  The Venatori have been a hot topic for a while.  The vampires have a lot of eyes and ears.  Marco could help."

"Marco and Bernstein have their own problems.  My father is hunting them.  Though they claim their kiss isn't involved in the crimes Kai says they are." I informed them.

Adrian sighed, "Put the New York vamps against the Venatori and those rumblings become actionable.  Nox you need to watch your back."

I shrugged, "I always have to."

## The Good Doctor

Adrian called Margo and supposedly got Jo released or will get Jo released under my care - citing I was her Alpha and he'd take responsibility for us both; me being an Exuli now.  That still rubbed the wrong way.  The tattoo at my temple still hurt even after three days.

I crashed in Gregory's room and he was the perfect gentleman.  Maybe not to Dorian's tastes, but he never once tried to make a move.  I kissed him one morning without thinking about it.  He just grinned at me when I had a panic attack afterwards.  "No big deal man,"  was all he could say.

I managed to get things relayed to Marco and Ant about my father.  Ant said he'd contact my Dad to get things straightened out.  Marco agreed to keep watch out for strange things.  Bernstein was annoying as usual and refused to even speak to me.  But really it didn't matter, I had the son of Il Cane and the Darkness behind the Crown on my side of things.  Bernstein was hardly anything compared to them, he wasn't even as old as Ant.

I didn't have any talents to speak of;  there was nothing I could do to make money.  Stephen joked that I could do magic tricks like one of those fake magicians - except it's real.  I was bored what could I say.

I set an alarm for thirty minutes before the alloted time on the note I was handed when I was exiled and I stuck my unfunctioning phone into my pocket - the service was cut off but hey wi-fi was nearly free everywhere these days.  I set up in central park with the rest of the buskers, set out can next to me on the ground and I started playing with my magic.

I started out slowly trying to make things work without looking like I was making them appear out of thin air.  I was good at my job but this was different.  Slight of hand was never my thing.  I borrowed a deck of cards from Stephen and a few cups from the party the night before - they were used but I washed them, no one else was going to touch them anyway.

I started with a few card tricks.  The first few flopped and I got a few laughs which earned me a few dollars when I played the idiot.  I started to get the hang of it and was fliping cards up and and around with the flicks of my finger tips.  They rolled from front to back with ease the more I got used to the fine manipulations of air that were unseen to the humans around me.

A few people told me they liked my tattoo.  I grinned a thanks at them and turned to show them the one on my neck.  Which usually garnered more compliments.  I couldn't see it so it could be completely not what I picked out when I was 16 but I knew it wasn't.  Though I always joked about it and the crowds that walked through central parked seemed to enjoy the game I was playing.

I created several balls of out thin air, pretending they'd been hidden in my pockets or in my backpack that sat next to me the whole time.  The balls were solidificed elements wrapped in air and I tugged on them like there were strings attached to them and they flew around me like yo-yos.  This was something I did to practice coordination.  I got a few more people to stop and drop money with this.  I ignored most people who stopped to watch but every once and a while a guy would stop and stare at me and when I would wink at him he'd wander away.  The girls were a little more leniant when I flirted with them.  They'd stay and chat for a while - and often they'd leave a tip.

My phone went off and threw the balls up into the air and they burst like bubbles.  That gained me a few more dollars in the can which I picked up and apologized.  "Sorry mates, gotta date."

I met Ant down on the subway platform where we always met and he handed me a burner phone.  He laughed softly to himself.  "Nice nails."

I smiled sweetly at him waggling my fingers at him.  "You like?"  

Ant rolled his eyes. "Cari says you can keep that.  She'll pay for the minutes as long as you aren't having phone sex with your lovers."  

I laughed as Ant continued, "Fairly certain she means me and Marco not Dorian."

I smiled.  "I've not spoken to him in three days.  I need to stay away from him.  I can't let this hurt him.  Garrett could still hurt him - them."

But I had a call to make.  It was a standard flip phone.  I hadn't used one of these in years.  It felt awkward in my hands as I held it to my ear.  It picked up in one ring, and an recorded message gave me an address. I jotted the address down on a peice of paper Ant handed me with a pencil and hung up.

Out of curiousity I called again and the number never picked up it gave me the this number is out of service.  Well then.

"Hey Ant, can I ask you a favor?"

"Sure. "  He paused and gave me a sideways look, "I think."

"Can you visit Dorian? And give him this."  I handed Ant an old school portfolio folder we used to use in school to hold papers.  It contained things I'd been drawing since I'd met him.  And a few notes about how to put my knowledge into actual use.  

Ant took the folder from me and nodded.  "You don't want me to kiss him or tell him you love him or anything?"  He gave me a look that clearly said he'd not mind doing so.

I grinned at him.  "No.  I don't want your lips close to him at all."

He looked offended, "Why the fuck not?  I could be good to him."

"You can't bite him Ant.  That's the only reason you like men.  While I don't mind you feeding on me.  You kill my boyfriend and we are going to have more than words."

He shook with laughter he was trying to hide.  "I did forget that fact.  You being that weird one-off like my mother."

I grinned. "Apparently I'm a one-off in so many ways."  I sighed.  "I gotta go to this place.  Run by it if I don't text you from this number."

He nodded and just like that was gone and I started jogging out of the subway towards my new destination.

The place we met was a fancy restaruant and I was not wearing anything appropriate.  I sighed and went in anyway and the hostest looked at me funny.  I spoke to her softly so as not to draw more attention to myself.  "My name is Nox, and I'm supposed to meet someone here."

The little blonde woman nodded with a smile.  She reached behind the counter and grabbed a suit coat and a tie.  "You can wear these.  Right this way."

I pulled the coat on over my t-shirt and the tie over my neck, I looked like some hipster but hey at least it all looked good.  I wished I'd done a little more with the make up - could have added a bit of color to the outfit.  She lead me to a private dinning room with only one table sat in the middle.  "This way Mr. Setanta."
  
I followed her and sat down at the table where a man sat.  The only thing I could see from the top of his blond head was that he wore an expensive suit and a gold rolex.  When he looked up and I saw his ice blue eyes I pushed my chair back.  "Asher Eriksen. I..."

He waved his hand.  "Come now.  It's not the first time you've been in the presense of the ruling families."

Two plates of an anti-pasto salad were set in front of us and Asher nodded. "I'm sure you are hungry.  The antics you are playing at these days pay far less than you are used to."

I smiled.  "I get by.  I've got a few people looking out for me."  But I didn't hesitate to eat what was offered me.  I just prayed he didn't expect me to pay for any of it.  I couldn't even on my hunter salary.

"You've some exotic friends - werewolves and vampires.  And not just the low ones that would flock to your power, no you know the Bernstein vampire and Il Cane herself."

I interjected.  "I don't know Cari personally."

Asher laughed, "But the fact that you feel comfortable calling The Hound by her given name says magnitudes about the relationship you have with her son and Chevalier."

I popped an olive into my mouth and when I was finished chewing I spoke softly. "You seem to know a lot about me."

"I've been doing my research into you for a few months now.  Seeing you out in the world is a unique experience.  The werewolves take you in and shelter a rogue Venatori.  That won't look good for them.  And the vampires become your eyes and ears and supply you with a phone.  I'm impressed with the friends you make."

I shrugged.  "That's what happens when you float in my circle."

"And what circle is that?" Asher asked with his hands steppled in front of him.  He hadn't touched anything other than his wine.

I took a swallow of the white wine in front of me and smiled as I remembered Dorian telling me about the flavors.

Asher pushed his plate in front of me.  "I'm good," I said.

He set it to the side.  "Take it home then.  I won't be able to make these arrangements again."

I nodded.  "Why am I here anyway?"

"I need you and Mark needs you.  You are aware of a conspiracy to kill our illustrious leader?"  Asher asked in a tone that said I did.

I shook my head.  "I know Garrett wanted me to try."

"Garrett Spencer?"  Asher looked curiously down at his napkin and the pulled out his phone and started tapping away at something there.

"Yes.  I have no allegience to him anymore, as long as I'm gone he has no reason to hurt anyone I love."

Asher nodded.  "Dorian is safe.  Mr. Green has added extra security to both Stella Row and the Vega estates, as well as to your father's family.  Is there anyone else who he might use against you?  Your suitors?  Jason Hill, has taken a leave of absense to spend it with his family in Florida at a rough suggestion from Dae'lin.  Something about keeping him away from you."

I sighed.  

Asher continued.  "Fear not, the boy doesn't worry for his safety from you, but he went home to keep the children safe from whatever is coming.  Apparently he eluded to the fact that you wouldn't have tried to kill Mark Green without good reason."

"No one really knows that reason do they?"  Asher asked.

"He told me to.  I reported Garrett immediately and he wanted me to follow through.  His guard gave me the note that lead me here."

Asher nodded.  "Yes, he did.  Like I said, he needs you and I need you.  A fair exchange."

"How is that fair?"

"Not to you my boy, to my ability to come here without anyone knowing what I'm doing.  Being an eccentric I get away with much more than anyone else."  Ahsher smiled.

The second round of food arrived - a hot bowl of tomatoe bisque.  Don't ask me how I knew that but I did.  I sipped at it and found it too hot.  "What does he want from me?"

"I'm sure you've guessed - fall little one.  Become what would make our evil-doers seek a vengeful soul out to do their dirty work.  That's what they did with Levi Hughes afterall, until you jumped off a building after him that is."

"why would they come after me again?  I failed."

Asher held up his finger and smiled at me.  "But not because you didn't try.  Mark was prepared for you, they don't know that, but they know you are more powerful than he is.  They will try again to recruit you.  You need to fall so low it looks like its plausible for you to do that again."

"So this is just another mission, except the payment is my exile."

Asher nodded his head sadly.  "If we deal with the culprit then we will pay you handsomely and set you up for life but yes the exile stands."

"And if I don't agree to this?"

Asher shrugged. "No lost cause for us.  You are still exiled."

I nodded.  "What do you want?"

Asher smiled as if he knew I wouldn't have anymore questions.  "I want your DNA.  You are immortal.  I don't know how I missed you before but I need to study you.  And since you are no longer part of the Venatori I am willing to add in a bonus to your situation.  Dorian will be freed from his obligation to procreate.  He will be allowed to be with an Exuli off campus and remain in good standing, if he so wishes."

"How can you tell me he'd be in good standing?  He'd be shunned more than he already is."

"Not at all, Nox.  Dorian is influential, he stands on is own two feet.  He will survive with out my interference, but then at least the two of you can be together."

"What do you need me to do then?"

"A few cups a month is all I ask."  Asher said flatly.

"You mean you want a sperm donation?"

Asher nodded.  "To use at my own discrection yes."

"For how long?"

"Let's say a year. And then maybe once a year after that to see if there are any changes?"

"For how long?"

"For as long as you live my boy."  Asher said with a smile.

"And if I'm truly immortal?"

Asher smiled, "Then you and I will become very good friends after all your loved ones have died and moved on."

I laughed.  "Are you saying you are..."  I stopped talking as the thoughts ticked away at my brain.  Asher has only been public for a few years now.  Before that he was hidden behind smoke and mirrors. His father was around for a short time.  Every twenty-five years like clockwork the Eriksen line changed handes.  It was almost like... I smiled.  "You are Aeternus.  The last of your kind.  Hiding in plain sight the whole time."

"You are clever."  Asher smiled.  "Patterns, it's all in the patterns isn't it.  I will have to change that up I think."

I took another sip of the soup and relished the flavor and the warmth.  "I will accept both offers."

Asher smiled.  "I never doubted it."  

Asher waved over the waitress.  "Let him finish his courses and box mine all to send with him out the back door."

Asher stood up and straightened his coat and tie and offered me his hand.  "It's been a pleasure doing business with you Mr. Setanta.  The paperwork is here in this envelope, the end sum we will pay you and all other contracts needed waiting your signature.  Leave them here and Mindy will get them to me. "  He took a step away from the table.  "Also, Nox, the address to the sperm bank I want you to use is in the folder.  There will be no more contact between us.  Good luck son."
## Falling

I ate two more courses after Asher left me.  The entry was a decadent pasta and shrimp dish I knew would be bad on my figure.  But I hadn't realized how ugh I had been starving myself these past four days.  Desert was a pumpkin sufle that I would have to learn how to make if I ever wanted to eat it again.  And I took the second meal with me.

But I didn't get too far with it before I saw a man with a small child sitting in an alley way underneath a cardboard box roof.  I handed the man the left over bag.  Paying it forward knowing what I was about to do was going to put me in a similar situation.

I sent Ant a text as I walked back to Gregory and Stephen ' place.  I asked him to meet me at Bonnie's diner.  

I knocked on the door and a small brunette with blue eyes opened the door and I smiled.  Then my heart sank.  I couldn't take Jo with me anymore than I could Dorian.  I hugged Jo and I could hear Adrian in the other room. I took her hand in mine and walked into the kitchen where the others were talking.

Adrian looked up at me and frowned when he saw the look on my face.  "That bad?"

I nodded. "I need you too look after Jo until I can finish this last mission."

Gregory shook his head.  "Going out with a bang."

"Actually.  It's more like 8 seconds of bliss."  They looked at me with confusion in their eyrs.  "Jace would have got it."

Adrian nodded.  "Just come back to us."

"I'll try."

I packed my bags and when I was on my way down the stairs a small line formed to see me off.  "This isn't goodbye.  So get out of my way."  I stuck my tongue out at the lot of them.  But none of the moved and I kissed them all - Jo a kiss to her cheek and all the others were slightly messier.  They had all been in my bed at one time or another.  I walked out the door and down the stairs before I turned around and looked back to see Adrian watching me.  I could see the sorrow on his face.  He knew what this meant.  I might not come back.  I saluted him and bowed with a flourish and he smiled.

I turned and went to the diner across from the AU building to meet Ant at sundown.  I was sitting in my normal place eating pumpkin pie when he showed up.  He sat across from me and frowned.  "What's wrong?" He asked.

"Did you see Dorian?"

Ant nodded and handed me a small box.  "He wanted you to have this."

I opened it to find a plain platinum ring inside.  I picked it up between two fingers and read the inscription "Always"

I wanted to cry and slipped it on my middle finger.  It was to big for any other.  

Ant laughed.  "He said if it was too big for his middle finger he can resize it easily. Seems he got it right the first time."

I smiled.  "I want you to look after him for me.  You don't have to be annoying about it.  But I'm going to do this last thing for the Venatori and I can't be worried about him."

Ant nodded. "Of course."

"I'm going to leave my things with you.  Including the phone.  I have to fall.  And it'll be easier with nothing to lean on.  I'll leave a message with Bonnie the first Monday of every month so you know I'm okay."  I took a deep breath. This was going to be hell.

"Okay.  You know how to find me if you need me."  Ant added, "And Marco too."

"Thanks."

Ant nodded at me with tearfilled eyes stood up grappling my bags and we waved a flourishing bow my way and walked out the diner. I was alone with my self.  First step work for my food.

I washed dishes for the pumpkin pie.  Which considering it was a punishment for not having money I had a good time chatting with Bonnie in the kitchen.

I ran for about a hour in one direction and then I found a spot where the homeless were gathering and found a spot.  A small black woman walked past me and found a damp spot to sit.  I offered her my spot and smiled at me and offered me a can
  I shook my head.  "Maybe next time."

I leaned against the wall and drifted to sleep.  My dreams were a chaotic mess and I started awake.  I didn't know the time so I decided to go for another run.  

When daylight came I went to central park to busk for a while.  My tricks were getting better and I made enough money for a bagel at a food cart in the park. I did the same for lunch and dinner.  I barely made enough to eat. 

I did the same thing for about a week until my stomach hurt from lack of food.  The second week I don't run anywhere. 

By the third week I was seriously  considering my options.   I reeked.   The money wasn't good enough for a shower. An older woman was walking past and I stepped into pace with her and asked, "do you know where a shelter is?"

She just kept on walking.   I dropped from her pace.  My perspective had certainly changed. I couldn't wait for it to rain.

In the middle of the fourth week the sky opened up. The rain was cold but I walked a mile in it before I found a balcony in a dry area to keep me dry.  I needed to shave badly but at least the rain washed some of the smell away.  My stomach rumbled but the weather would keep my paying viewers at bay so I stayed as dry as possible. 

The next day was nice and a lady walking past stopped to watch me.  She loomed at the Tao on my temple and frowned but she dropped money on the can with a note.   I didn't get to read or til that night but it was an address to a shelter

I was grateful but it wasn't close.  I walked the distance there and was grateful for a bed and a hot meal. I also managed a shower and to shave.   The color in my hair had long since faxed into the chocolate brown of my natural hair color.  The polish on my nails chipped long ago.   

The next few weeks I saw the same woman who have me the address walk by and drop money in my can and leave a different note each day. 

On this particular day I read the note while I ate half a sandwich from one of my viewres.  He stopped by near daily to watch the show. 

The note said meet me and gave me an address.  The note was written on a pamphlet for the CCB.  I had a pretty good feeling this is what I was waiting for.  I left my spot early and walked to the shelter and showered.  I still had a hang up about being dirty on a date even one that could get me killed.

## Elena

The address turned out to be a motel.  Not good. Last thing I needed was a rap sheet with a prostitution mark on it.  I went in and the lady saw me at the front desk and started to usher me out the door until the nice woman stepped in.  "Oh darling.  There you are."  She took me by the arm and lead me to a room.

The room was filled with her scent and I could clearly smell the forest now.  She had been good at masking what she was before now.  She closed the door behind her and opened the closet.  "Darling these are for you.  We have much to talk about.  Shower, shave.  Bask in the glory of what the Creed of  Celestial Beings can offer a lost soul like yourself. And we'll talk over diner."

I slide the hangers in the closet and saw a bunch of clothes that were too expensive for my tastes and several items that looked like they had better days.  I think they called that vintage.  "Why me?"

She caressed the tattoo on my temple with the tip of her finger nail and it sent shivers down my spine.  "Because of this."

"Because I've been exiled from the only thing I've ever known?"

She smiled at me with the red painted lips pressed neatly against her white teeth and I knew exactly what she was trying to do.  I'd done it several times myself.  She picked up my hands and turned them palm up.  "And these."

"My hands?"

"What you can do with your hands."  Her voice was like silk over my skin.

I laughed softly.  "You have no idea what I can do with my hands."

She placed my right hand simply on her hip and raised the other one to her lips. "Oh I've been watching you."  She kissed the ring on my finger.  "And you do such great things to protect your family."

I pulled away from her, "That sounds like a threat."

Her smile turned to a pout and only made her seduction hurt more.  "It wasn't a threat.  Garrett tried it, while it worked.  It is not my methods."

"So you want the same thing?"  I stared at her with daggers in my eyes.  They were really going to blantantly recruit me to kill my own kind again.

She shook her head.  "No.  And yes.  We do not want you to be the instruament of his death, but yes we want it.  What supernatural creature wouldn't want to cut off the head of the snake that has been slowly bleeding us."

"So you'll be no better than them?  You'll kill an innocent man because he leads the lot of hunters who make it their goal in life to kill your kind?  That sounds fabulous, like something I really want to be a part of. The Venatori are many things, but they beleive they are doing the right thing.  They just need to be re-educated.  You let them get away with teaching supernatural classes and think that will work.  All they teach you is how to spot one, how to kill them.  They teach us not so we can make peace, but so that we can kill you easier."

"Things need to change, but taking down the Venatori is not the answer.  They are built to take down a dragon, and a vampire and were's that go bad.  They are a great asset, but they need to learn they aren't the law."

She smiled at me with renewed vigor.  "I knew I had picked the right man."  She offered me her hand.  "Nox Sétanta, I am Elena Johnson and I would like to formally welcome you to the Creed of Celesital Beings.  The Venatori exiled you and watched you fall, the CCB will pick you up and you might be just the answer we've been looking for."

I took her hand a little afraid of the woman who had manipulated me so perfectly.  Her smile widened at my caution.  "This is yours for the night.  We will talk over dinner, and tomorrow we will show you to our recruit center and your new home.  There are several supplies in the bathroom you might find welcoming."  She reached up and ran her fingers through my hair, "You are missing much of your beautiful color.  I'd like to see it restored."

She gave me one last smile before she walked out into the hall.

I watched her go and then took a look around the room.  It wasn't much, but it was warm, the bed was soft and there were no bugs in it.  The sheets were clean and I felt gross just touching anything.  

I had been wearing one of my favorite shirts when I left Gregory's so many weeks ago.  I wished I hadn't, it was ragged and dirty beyond compare.  I pulled it over my head and walked into the bathroom and the bright lights above the mirror shown down on exactly what I'd become.  I could see my ribs through my chest, what muscle I had once had was now gone from lack of training and lack of food.  My hair ran into my face from where Elena had ruffled it.  It was too long everywhere, my beard was overgrown, though it could have been worse.  

The tattoo at my right temple was still red and angry.  I wondered if it would ever heal correctly, but as I'd told everyone else it was a punishment, so I doubted it.  

I looked like shit!

I removed my clothes and tossed them into the garbage can.  I turned the water and let the hot water scream through the shower head until the room fogged up and I stepped into the searing water.  The heat felt good against my aches and pains and seared away the dirt and grime and gross feeling I had.

I thik I used a whole bar of soap washing myself before I felt like I was clean again.  The bottles of shampoo and conditioner were gone.  By the time I was done with washng the water had run cold and I stood under the frigide water and let it fall on my face.  This was real.  This had become my life.  I couldn't go back to the Venatori even if I wanted to.  But did I really want to let myself fall into the cespool that would recruit my demon?  

There was a knock on the door and I turned the water off and yelled, "Be right there!" as I grabbed a towel and wrapped it around me and another to at least dry a little before answering the door.  But I hadn't needed to rush Elena was opening the door and her smile widened as she saw me walking out of the bathroom in nothing but the towel around my waist.  "You've just now gotten a shower?  It's been two hours."

I smiled.  "Um, no.  I've been in the shower for that long apparently."

She smiled and pulled a chair out.  "Sit and I will cut your hair.  I am sure you will feel better with that rag top out of your face."

"I like it in my face."  Though I did sit down, "Just not this much of it."

She walked into the bathroom and carried a basket of things out.  I hadn't even checked to see what was in it and was sad to find real bottles of shampoo and conditioner and a bottle of body wash.  "I suppose I should have looked in that before my shower."

She smiled, "Perhaps."  She set the basket on my lap.  "I've seen pictures.  I think I can get your usual style back if that's what you'd like"

"Yes ma'am".

Elena ran her fingers through my wet hair and started combing it like she'd done this a million times.  I asked.  "This what you do for a living?  A hair dresser I mean."

"It is one of the many things I do for the CCB."  I could feel her fingers against my head and the clippers pressing against the side of it as she carefully cut the undercut at the side of my head.  We sat in silence for several minutes with only the sounds of her shearing my hair from my head.  Her voice was soft and I could hear the concern she had in it as she spoke to me, "I'm surprised you hadn't sold the ring on your finger.  Even a little extra cash could go a long way on the streets."

I looked at the platnium ring on my left middle finger and smiled.  It was a little too big for me now and I hadn't even realized it.  "I can't sell it.  It's not mine to sell."

"Dorian gave it to you?"

"You know about Dorian?"  I could hear ths shock in my own voice.

"I know a great many things about you Nox Sétanta.  A great many things.  Did Dorian give it to you?"  She asked again sweetly. 

"Yes."

"You should forget him, love.  He's Venatori." I could hear the venom in her voice as said Venatori.  I wanted to leave but I couldn't I had a mission to complete even if I didn't like this I had to do it.

"I can't forget him.  I dream about him every night.  I see his eyes when I'm awake.  He haunts me and I miss him for it."

"Such a romantic.  I never would have thought a frequenter of The famous Big O could be so romantic."

"I've not been part of that circle for years."

She laughed.  "And that is why Adrian Sheridan watches over your little wolf, and you stayed with two of his pack members when you first were exiled?"

"I had no where else to go, they are as close to friends that I get."  

"You have Anthony Giovanni and Marco Ferri but then you'd have to deal with Bernstein who I hear is trying to kill your father and Dorian's I might add."  Elena was indeed well informed.

She ran her fingers through my hair again and patted my head.  "That should do it love.  Now I will give you an hour to finish and change the reservation I made since you took so long in the shower."

I stood up and looked in the full length mirror and I could see Elena checking me out and I grinned.  "I don't need an hour."

She handed me a box of hair color.  "I said I'd like to see some color."

I laughed.  "The one good thing about being Cesari is I can do just about anything."  I pulled a section of hair into my fingers and twirled it carefully around.  "What color would you like?"

She raised an eyebrow.  "Your favorite color."

"Do you know what that is?"  I asked as I fulfilled the request.

She shook her head.  "It's a surprise."

I laughed and between my fingers my hair turned a bright shade of orange against the chocolate of the rest of my hair.  Elena laughed.  "If I could do that I would be rich!"

I winked at her and grabbed a few more strands and changed them to orange.  I added a few blue spikes the color of Dorian's eyes and smiled.  

Elena smiled.  "Perfect.  If you hurry we can still make the reservation."

I grabbed the eye liner and the razor and shaving cream and went back into the bathroom to shave and finish the last touches of my look.  It was amazing how much better I felt, and how much better I was going to feel when I was done with all of the prep work to be presentable.

Elena laid out a pair of black jeans, a saphire blue button down shirt and a black t-shirt with a pair of plaid boxers.  I shook my head at the outfit but I didn't hesitate.  The towel fell to the floor and I heard Elena gasp slightly at the sudden reveal.  My back was to her, but I think it was the frist time she noticed my back than for the sudden shock of my back side.

As I was pulling on my boxers I felt a touch along my spine and I froze.  "Who would ruin such a beautiful boy?"

I sighed, "Garrett Spencer.  Please don't touch me there."

Her hand jerked away.  "I'm sorry."

"Just don't do it again please.  Anywhere else, but there."  I pulled the boxers up and the t-shirt on before I spoke again.  "He made me do it, but I did it to myself.  It's part of the nightmares of my life.  I'm sure Garrett never mentioned them."

She shook her head and looked at me with horror on her face.  "He will pay, my love."

"I am not **your** love.  But thank you. And I think I can handle a little weasel like him."  I finished getting dressed in silence.  Everything fit well I was surprised, though the pants were a little too loose, I'd lost so much weight.  I was going to be a skeleton after a few more months.  

I offered Elena my hand.  "Dinner?"

Elena took it with a smile and she handed me the card key to my room before we left.
## The Creed of Celestial Beings

As we walked to the hotel restaurant I was surprised when Elena said quietly, "If you are capable of hurting the man who hurt you why have you not yet?"

I sighed.  "He terrifies me.  He always has."

"All the more reason to let me handle the little weasel as you said."  The look on her face made me cringe in fear of her.  It was a look of pure hatred and one that meant she would do it anyway even if I asked her not to.

"He's the reason I am the man I am.  Killing him is too merciful if you ask me."  Which she hadn't but her look softened with a wicked smile and I knew that if Elena ever got her hands on Garrett he was going to feel every ounce of pain she imagined I went through.  I asked her as she was looking at me with such feeling.  "Why would you do that for me?  You don't even know me."

Elena squeezed my hand, "We in the CCB look after our own, and when one of our own hurts another there are penalties to be had.  And you were only a boy when you were at the hands of Spencer and children are not abused.  Even James will understand."

"Who is James?"  I asked.

Elena smiled.  "You will meet James soon.  But for now you are mine.  He and Charles are dealing with other matters upstate."

"You mean the current leaders of the CCB then.  James Wright and Charles Saunders.  You know them?"

Her smile was wide.  "I know more than know them, darling.  Charles is my husband."

I grinned, "And here I thought you had your eyes on me."  I winked at her.

She blushed slightly but it left as quickly as it had come.  "Is it not warrented."  She ran her hand over my arm with a smile as we waited for the elevator to stop.  "Even as ragged as you were, the handsome man you've become was shining through."

I laughed, "You can stop acting as if you are interested Elena.  You had me at 'bask in the glory'.  I'm on board.  Though I won't kill anyone for you.  I'm done with that life."

Elena smiled.  "It is not an act nor did I doubt your conviction to the cause, but you've not yet met enough of us to fully commit.  Though if you are willing to join the organization of your tormentor I would have to think you are serious in your ideals.  At dinner we shall talk of the Creed and what it means to be part of us."

We walked into the hotel restaurant and at the sight of Elena the hostest was walking us to our table in a quiet area of the place.  I pulled Elena's chair out and she smiled up at me as she sat down.  "A gentleman even if he was homeless a mere 3 hours ago."

I laughed, "My manners never left me."

We sat down and a bottle of wine was already being poured into crystal cglasses and I had a pang of grief remembering Dorian as my ring dinged the glass as I picked it up.  Elena's voice was soft across the table from me.  "I have taken the liberty of ordering our meal so it would be ready when we got here, I hope you don't mind."

As she said that the waiter set down a rather large steak and a second plate of vegetables on the side in front of me.  I looked at him with wide eyes.  It smelled divine.  I stabbed a peice of brocolli and popped it in my mouth.  I was in heaven.  Elena watched me as I chewed slowly and savored every last bite.  I'd been living off of junk and even that junk I had lost weight.  I mumbled, "Thank you" between bites.

She smiled as she started eating on her much smaller portion of fish and pasta.

I was half way finished with the large plate of vegetables and hadn't even touched the steak yet when I asked.  "Tell me about the Creed."

Elena nodded and set her fork down and pulled a large file from her bag and set it on the table.  "This is everything you should need to know about the Creed.  How we are funded, what our aims are and how we operate.  It is very packet of information we give our new ranked officers.  But you are only a new recruit.  Not yet privy to this information, however I have talked James into allowing you this information after your initiation.  For the sole reason that if we didn't tell you straight up you would figure it out yourself.  You have resources beyond the were community.  You have tight connections inside the Venatori and even the Vampires.  You are a well known figure in the Underground because of the number of us who have had your help without ever realizing it.  You were in the Rockies, but your presence out in the world was felt even here."

I was dumbfounded by the knowledge.  I hadn't thought I was doing anything to be noticed outside the Venatori.  "You said initiation."

"That won't be for several more weeks if you truly decide to stay with us.  You will be placed in one of hostels and given a job - a normal, mundane job not pretending to be a magician of note."

I snickered.  "But it's so fun pulling the wool over human's eyes."

She winked at me.  "I'm sure you love it.  It was fun watching even if I knew you were using your gift.  You were entertaining, and such a flirt even when you wore rags the girls and some of the boys kept coming back each day."  Elena placed on top of the folder.  "This is the address of the hostel you will be staying with.  You can have your things delivered here."

"My things?"

"You are a resourceful hunter.  A hunter who was in the field for 10 years before living on the street I doubt you left the Venatori with nothing to fall back on."

I nodded. "If you knew I had a fall back plan why are you recruiting me."

She reached across the table and caressed the angry tattoo on my temple, "I already told you darling, this, " she touched my fingers on the table, "and this.  "  Her hands pulled away from me slowly, "And your rousing speach in the hotel room were all wonderful examples of how you can help us.  Some of us beleive as you others not so much, but we all do what we can.  Garrett was right about one thing, Nox.  You can help us, even if my Charles doesn't beleive so."

Elena set a phone on top of the pile.  "Can you text your friend?"

I nodded.  She pushed the entire pile to me.  "I trust you she said.  You will join us."

I picked up the phone and typed in Ant's number and texted him.  [i]New number.  I'm in.  Drop things off at address. - Nox[/i]  I hit send and turned the phone to her so she could read as I placed it back on the pile the screen still on.

She smiled.  "I'm in?  Part of some larger plan?"

I shrugged.  "Honestly I don't know.  I was told to fall.  So that's what I did.  This is where it lead me."

"I wouldn't have thought you'd share that with me.  Venatori are always so tight lipped."

I shrugged.  "Why should I hide from it?  You would have figured it out.  You are resourceful."

Elena laughed.  "Turnabout is fair play.  Finish your dinner.  I'm sure you are looking forward to sleeping in a real bed with real pillows and blankets."

I nodded, "But actually I'd like to hit the gym first, if you don't mind."

"Not at all, Nox.  It is your life.  I will be by in the morning to introduce you to your new family.  And they will indoctrinate you to our way of life.  I'm sure you will find it similar to living at the AU building."

The phone blinked and Elena turned it so I could read.  [i]Okay.[/i]

He's a talkative one. "That was not Ant.  Likely it was his mother who is a technophobe and always proper."

"Why would Il Cane be answering her son's texts?"

I smiled.  "Probably because I texted her and not Ant.  My last contact with my friends said that he was out of town and I should text her instead if need arose.  "  I waved my hand at Elena.  "Need arose."

"You have The Hound's phone number memorized?"

I smiled.  "I hunt vampires for a living, Duckling.  When you step into vampire territory it is good to have a few cards to play.  Vampires like to handle their own business so I alert her to my cases.  She gives me the results I need and she's there if I need help."

"So you've meet the Hound?"

I shook my head.  "No.  I've never spoken to anyone in her crew other than Ant and Ryan, her Chevalier.  Though Jack has done me a few favors with computer shit."

"And how many Alpha's do you know?"

I shrugged.  "Enough.  Here in New York, I only now Adrian.  In the rockies when I'm hunting a were I always find the Alpha and ask for help or permission which ever is the easiest in that territory."

"You know I don't think I have ever heard of a Venatori hunter who asks permission.  This must be the reason you make so many waves here in the courts."  

"You have now."

## Trouble Brewing

Elena and I chatted through the rest of dinner, though I think most of it was flirting and not so much informative.  She seemed confident that I was going to fit in perfectly.  I wasn't exactly so sure about that.  Like the dinner with Asher she ordered desert - strawberry cheesecake.

I wasn't a big sweets person, but I ate it anyway.  I could be picky when I was actually feeding myself again.  Tonight I ate too much, I would probably be sick afterwards particularly since I used the gym which I hadn't touched in more than six weeks.  I was not impressed with myself.  I had work to do.

But at least things were looking up.  Back at my room Elena stood closer to me than was necessary, the little red dress she was wearing clung to her curvy body and I could see the faces of other men as they walked past us.  And the dirty looks from the women who thought it was inappropriate.  Her raven hair fell over her shoulders and covered most of her back that was exposed.  Long legs in red high heels.  I wanted to touch her.  I could feel the want inside me - the desire to take her with me into my room.

She carressed my neck and leaned against me pretending to be a little tipsy.  I knew better the wine bottle at our table remained full except for the two initial cups we had been poured at the beginning of dinner which were still both half full when we left.  It was amazing finding a woman who played the same tricks I did.

I leaned down and kissed her softly.  "I'm tired Elena.  Good-night."

She pouted as I used the key behind my back and opened the door to escape her fingers on my neck.  Her voice was low and breathy when she said Good night.  

She was trying hard - too hard.

I pulled off all the new clothes and folded them neatly on the other bed and curled up in nothing but my boxers in the luxurious sheets, there was only one thing missing.  I thought about calling Dorian.  But a text landed on my screen from Ant.  [i]May I?[/i]

I flipped off all the lights in the room and closed the curtains in the window before crawling back in bed to answer the text.  [i]Sure.[/i]

And in the few seconds it took the message to send, a woman wearing all black and a sword at her side was standing in the doorway of the closet - the darkest shadow in the room.  I had expected Ant, not his mother.

I sat up and she gave me a wry glance before taking a step closer.  "Your things were delevired this morning to the address requested."

"You could have sent that in the text."

She smiled.  "Yes, but it is not why I'm here."  She didn't wait for me to say anything as she continued.  "Ant said if you were to contact me to give you this in person."  She sighed, "He stressed the in person.  It was important."

I took the paper from her and our fingers touched, her skin was ice cold.  She was truly an undead vampire, at least Ant and Marco were warm to the touch.  She cocked her head to the side.  "What is bothering you?"

I shook my head. "Nothing, you are just cold.  I'm not exactly overly physical with the embraced."

She smiled, and it frightened me.  I could feel the pulse rise in my neck as my heart raced.  "I frighten you?"

"You are Il Cane.  Of course the fuck you frighten me."

The smile grew wider and she nodded. "And you are Nox Setanta - fearless."

"Ha! I'm afraid of a great many things.  But I don't let my fear rule me."

"Read it."  She commanded.

I blinked at her and she nodded at the paper in my hand.  It was a note written in Dorian's glorious hand writing.  I smiled as I started to read it.

> My love,
>
> I miss seeing you but I understand.  This is not a personal note however.  Our fathers plan to ambush the vampires you have set up a meeting with.  I have told Ant and he thanked me for the information and wished me the best of luck in the upcoming war.  If our father's do this, Nox, the will be a war.  If you are anywhere in any place that you can help, you must.  I don't think the world will survive if the Vampires break the Providence.
>
> Again.  I miss you.  I love you - Always, Dorian

My heart sank when I read it.  I looked up at Cari Giovanni who sat on the edge of the other bed.  "When is the meeting?" I asked.

She frowned, "I am unware of it.  Ant has not told me and Ryan is keeping quiet.  Bernstein doesn't like when I come here.  I throw off his carefully placed balancing act.  And Marco refuses to speak to me."

"Why would he refuse?" I was genuinely curious as I pulled the pillow closer to me.  I didn't like being exposed to the most powerful vampire in the world.  To every supernatural race Il Cane is the one thing that bumps back against the things that go bump in the night.  Dragons fear her and they can flame throw her so easily.

She rolled her eyes, "Because I will not allow him in my bed."

I laughed.  "If it's important he'll tell you.  Nevermind he'll tell me."  

I typed in Marco's number and texted him. [i]When are you meeting my father? and where[/i]

There was an immediate shimmer in the shadows and Marco appeared.  He was pouting when I looked over at him.  "You are with her."  He pointed at the hound sitting on the other bed.

"Answer my question Marco."

He crossed his arms over his bare chest and shook his head.  "Do you wish to ever find yourself in **my** bed?"

He pouted.  "Not that you plan to share yourself anymore - anyway.  But ..."  He relaxed his entire body giving up the whole charade.  "I suppose if there is ever a chance I cannot be denied it.  Your father plans to ambush at your and Ant's favorite meeting spot.  Plenty of hiding places and at an hour where there are few citizens of our fair city."  He took the paper Dorian's note was on and wrote down the time and place.  "Just in case you forgot."

There was a knock on my door.  "Nox?"

I waved the vampires away.  "Elena?  One second."

Cari vanished into thin air before even stepping into the darkened shadows.  It showed her power.  Marco frowned.  "Show off," he whispered.  He kissed my cheek softly, "You were missed."  And then he was gone.

I hated vampire politics but the CCB wasn't exactly looking to play nice either if they were the ones behind the assassination attempts on Mark's person.

I unfurled from the blankets and opened the door for Elena.  She was still wearing the little red dress but had removed her shoes.  Behind her stood a little brunette and I smiled at her.  "I have brought company.  Sheridan sends his reguards, however he is currently a little tied up at the moment."

I raised my eyebrow at the reference, Adrian was a lot of things but he was not a submissive.  "I do hope it's of his own free will."

"Yes, darling.  It is part of our deal."

"Your deal?"

She smiled.  "You can have your darling wolf, and I have him for the night."

"Leah agreed to this?"

"What the little wife doesn't know."  Elena said as she wandered off to her room. 

I whispered, "She'll smell you all over him."

Elena laughed, "I hope so darling."

I waved Jo in.  She hadn't taken her eyes off of me.  I was in my boxers.  As she passed by me she ran her fingers over the scar on my chest.  It sent a shiver down my spine but not in the way it had with Elena.  It was different - the energy was different.  She didn't get far inside as she wrapped her arms around me and pressed her check into my chest.  

I wrapped my arms around her and closed the door.  I could smell the forest on her stronger than usual. "I need to sleep."

Jo took off her shoes and jeans and crawled into next to me and curled up against my body.  It felt good to hold her.  My thoughts drifted to Dorian as I fell asleep.

## Going Home

As usual my nightmares came and woke me up but I didn't want to move with the woman drapped over me sleeping like a baby.  I wasn't in a rush, It wasn't like I felt the need to get up and run.  I hadn't run in over a month.  I hadn't worked out.  I felt it too.  I would get back on track once my life became a schedule again.  At least a human schedule not someone inhuman without a real job and a life.

I could sound pitiful and hate the way my life was but I had done it to myself.  My anxiety the first few weeks was through the roof.  But I never let depression set in.  I felt sorry for myself, but then I'd remember I made the decision.  I fell and now the CCB was going to lift me back up.  Already it was feeling better.

There was a knock at the door and I lifted Jo's arm from my chest and put it over the pillow, she pulled it closed with a murmur and slipped back into her slumber.  I answered the door in my boxers.  

Adrian looking a little bit worse for wear was standing buttoning his shirt in front of me when I pulled the door open.  I gave him a knowing grin.  "Have fun?"

He winked at me.  "Jo get here alright?"

I nodded, "She's sleeping."

He looked past me into the room, "With you?"

"It wasn't like that."  

Adrian grinned at me.  "I know.  She's pack.  When I told her she was going with you her mood picked up.  Whatever you did to her that connection is strong.  Even Leah couldn't get her to sit with her."  Adrian leaned in sniffed my skin.  He leaned back with a wide smile.  "Touch is important to our kind.  But it alwasys was for you too.  I mean how else could you sleep with a hot guy like Jason Hill and not have sex with him?"

I grinned, "It wasn't easy."  I lied because it was easy, Jace was like my brother.  I loved him, but not the way he wanted me to.  I sighed and looked back behind me.  "I don't know how to do this, Adrian."

"Do what?"

"Be this." I waved my hand back at Jo.

He smiled.  "You are doing perfect.  Better than most Alpha's.  She's family Nox.  That's all you have to remember."

Elena stepped out of her room carrying a small bag and smiled happily at me in her navy blue suit dress.  Even with the navy high heels on she only came up to my arm pits.  She pulled Adrian down by his shirt and kissed him hard.  Adrian's lips were painted red from her lipstick.  He fought the urge to kiss her again before he turned and left with a salute.  "Fare thee well Nox Setanta and I wish you a hearty hunt."

I smiled.  "Right back at ya Adrian."

Elena laughed.  "You know what is right?"

I nodded.  "I've been around enough pack yes.  I know what it means.  It's a traditional farewell when someone is going away for a while - usually to their death."

"And you don't think it's slightly ironic?"  she asked.

"Depends on how you look at it."  I stepped inside my room leaving the door open for Elena to come in.  "I'll wake Jo up and we'll get ready."

Elena sat down on the undisturbed bed, "Not a rush darling."

I was already shaking Jo's shoulder.  "Jo.  Time to take a shower, we need to go."

She rubbed her eyes and frowned and covered her head with the pillow.  I grinned, "Fine then I'll shower first."

I tossed Elena the remote as she kicked back on the bed.  She smiled at me as she pulled out a book from her bag.  "You slept with her?"

I shrugged.  "It felt right.  I'm going to shower."

Elena nodded to my head, "Change the color.  Crimson suits my needs today."

I nodded.  "Yes ma'am."

I showered and fixed the color of my hair.  It was easier to remove the color first and then add in new streaks.  It was only crimson red today.

I walked out in just the towel and shook Jo's shoulder.  "Now, babe.  Up and at 'em or I'll stuff you in a cold shower."

She hurmped and pulled her small self out of bed and staggered into the shower.

I stood in front of the closet full of clothes and tried to decide what to wear.  I decided upon the jeans from last night a crimson t-shirt under a black button up shirt.

Elena stood behind me and took the dress shirt from me, "Why do you always wear long sleeves?"

She tossed it to the bed and handed me a leather jacket that looked like something James Dean might wear.  It was dark brown and didn't match I looked at her with confusion.  "This doesn't go with anything I chose."

She grinned.  "I forget, gay man."

"I'm not gay." But I smiled as I said it, I knew she was saying it to poke fun at me.

"Are you going to answer me?"  Elena asked handing me a black blazer.

"What's wrong with the shirt?"  

She looked at me, "You wore the same outfit yesterday in a different color."

"And?"

"Darling..."  she sighed, "You look five."

I laughed.  "Elena.  I'm not pulling out the sweats and hoodies just for you."

"As if you'd wear sweat pants."

"Maybe not but I could.  What's wrong with the long sleeve shirts.  I'm being presentable in something I can tolerate.  The backs of my arms are covered in scars, I'd rather not have to explain them or hide them.  Sleeves make it easier."

She sighed.  "Fine. Fine.  Be logical."

I smiled, "What's wrong with the shirt?"

"Choose another color."

I asked her, "What color would you like?"

"The color of your hair."

I smiled and took the black shirt off the bed and changed it.  It was the same principle as I'd done to my hair.  It just took a little longer as I rewound the fibers of color into the right orders.  

She stood slack jawed as I pulled the crimson red button down shirt over top the black t-shirt I wore yesterday.

"Darling, tell me, could you have fed yourself, and cleaned the clothes you wore and hell made your own?"

I nodded.  "Yes.  The food would taste like dust, because flavor is not replicated but the sustinance would have been the same."

"Why the fuck didn't you?"

"I wouldn't be here if I did."

She laughed.  "You played us as much as we played you.  You want to be here?"

I shook my head.  "I don't know if here is where I'm supposed to be.  But I trust that it's the right place as I fell.  I could have hit rock bottom, but I didn't.  I could have gotten back into my old life.  Been that guy again.  I could have gone on living through the charity of others because I was that good.  But I made a choice.  And here is where I am.  I don't intend to fall again, Elena."

"Good Nox.  Good!"

Jo came out wearing the same clothes as yesterday. Elena raised her eyebrow.  "You wore that yesterday!"

Jo rolled her eyes.  "For like two hours."

"She's fine Elena."  I took Jo's hand and grabbed the stuff on the desk that Elena had given me.  "What's going to happen to the clothes?"

"It'll stay here for the next tall thin man we recruit."

"Good it's mostly hideous."

Elena nodded.  "Yes, it is."

I opened the door and offered Elena my other arm which she gratefully took.  And we went home.



## A Real Little Boy

We ate breakfast at a McDonald's, that was a first for me.  I let Jo order for me since none of it sounded apetizing at all.  And I had been right, I didn't like it.  

We took a cab to a neighborhood similar to where Gregory lived.  The building we pulled up at was a multilevel building that with the words "apud pack sunt , in superbia , et in aliis coetibus distinctio" engraved above the door.

I asked, "What does that say?"

Elena smiled.  "Residing here are pack, pride, and other groups of distinction."

"The creed of the CCB."

Elena nodded.  "One of our hostles for wayward were's and members who wish to live with their pack, pride or group."  She smiled.  "This is a werewolf hostle, but all are welcome."

Elena lead the way into the building.  The entrance was like that of any multilevel building with apartments.  Except it lead into a very large common room where a tiny little girl played.  Elena interrupted the girl's conversation she was having with someone they couldn't see.  "Celia.  Can you find your mother or father for me.  You have new residents."

Celia looked up at them and she smiled.  She grabbed Jo's hand and dragged her off down one of the halls.  "Momma said I could show her to her room."  Celia then yelled, "Momma, Ms. Elena is here."

Elena was rolling her eyes and I was holding back laughter as woman in a white apron walked out from a room I assumed would be the kitchen.  "Elena.  Where is Jo?"

"Celia took her already."

"Of course she did."  The woman wiped her hands on her apron and offered me here hand.  "My name is Emily Parker and you've met my daughter Celia already.  You must be Nox."

I nodded as I brought her hand to my lips and kissed softly.  "A pleasure."

"Your things arrived last night by courier they are in your room.  Let me show you around."  She turned to Elena, "Charles called.  He said when  you got here to inform you he will be working late tonight.  Entertain yourself."

Elena laughed like it was a normal thing for her husband to blow her off like that.  "It seems I have time to help indoctrinate our newest member."

Emily frowned, "You are optimistic he will stay."

"He will.  I promise you that."  Elena took my arm and started down the hall Jo had moved down with Celia.  She opened the first door in the hall, "This is the communal bedroom."

Emily added.  "There is no sex in this room."

I nodded.  "Figured that since kids live here."  I grinned at Ms. Parker, "I assume you've read my files as well."

She blushed.  "We all have, otherwise you'd have been placed elsewhere."

I smiled.  "I will behave myself."

Elena added.  "And I must say it's a slight disappointment that he does.  I had such high expectations of him."  She smiled at me with a seductive look.

Emily kept moving and ignored the conversation but I could see the rose color at the base of her neck and ears.  "The library is here and across from it is the game room."

A pair of stairs let up, "That is to the girls dorms."

We went back towards the living area.  "The kitchen."  Emily pointed and I stepped inside the kitchen despite the fact that Emily had moved on.  Both of the women stepped inside as I was running my hand over the stainless steel stove top.  

I smiled.  "Can anyone use it?"

"Of course.  We have family meals prepared for all meals, and left overs are always saved."

"Can I cook? I mean."

"You cook?"  Emily asked.  The shock in her voice was something I was used to.

"Since I was 10."

She nodded, "Of course.  But if you cook you need to make enough for everyone."

"Not a problem."

I looked up and saw Elena happily grinning at me.  I gave her a smile that said I was awesome.

She laughed.  

"This way."  She pointed down another hall way that joined with the one she'd been moving too.  "This is the class rooms here.  And up there, is the boys dorms.  Where you will be."

"In the entrance is the stairs up to the family dwellings, multiple conjoined rooms for families like mine."  She pointed to the stairs.  "Shall we?"

I followed Emily up three flights of very unsteady stairs that were probably worse than taking any elevator.  My heart was racing by the time we had climbed to the top floor.  "The second door on the right is yours."

There was a key in the door and she turned it and pushed it open handing me the key afterwards.  My things were on the bed.  It looked like a college dorm room.  The bed wasn't very big, there was a desk and a dresser.  I asked, "And are there any rules?"

"What do you mean?"  Emily asked.

"House rules.  Curfew?  No boys in the girl dorms? things like that?" I asked.

She shook her head.  "If you cook, cook enough for everyone.  Clean up after yoursef.  Treat everyone with respect, we are all pack."

"You can come and go as you please. The key is also a key to the house.  We have a communal car if you need it.  There are computers in the game room."

Elena glanced at her phone that was silently buzzing in her hand.  She smiled.  "Darlings I must be going.  Nox.  I'd like a home cooked meal tonight."

"Yes ma'am 8pm sound good?"

"Of course."  Elena turned to Emily.  "Auto is waiting for him."

Emily nodded.  "I will take him there immediately."

Elena left my room with a princess wave and was down the stairs before Emily and I got into the hall way.  "Who's Auto?"

Emily laughed.  "Ironically he's our mechanic.  You will be working for him.  He's getting up there in age and a young strapping man like yourself even with no experience will be a great amount of help.  And he'll teach you a thing or two."

"I look forward to it."  I was starting to feel like a real little boy - I wondered if Pinocchio felt like this when he was turned into flesh.## A New Life

Emily walked with me three blocks to an garage that looked like it had better days.  There were several cars parked outside and all of the bays were full.  There was a high priced looking woman yelling at an balding man with thin gray hair and glasses.  He looked like he was tired of listening.  

I smiled as I walked up.  "Hi."  The woman looked at me with my bright smile and turned her anger on me.  "What do you want?"

"Let me see if I can help you."  I took her by the arm and asked, "What seems to be the problem?"

"I need my car." She fumed.

"Which one is your's ma'am?"

She pointed to the Mercedes in one of the bays.  "Alright.  I will check on what the hold up is.  In the mean time, here is $10 for a coffee across the street.  I will get you your information as soon as I can."

She smiled at me the anger seemed to have lifted at least a little as she took the money from my hand.  She turned and walked across the street as I suggested.

"You'll go broke like that young man."  The man she was yelling at said as I walked over to him and Emily.  

"You must be Auto.  I'm sorry I stepped in, but you looked fustrated.  I can't imagine having a high priced woman yelling at me for god knows how long as you have been doing for as long as you've been a live."

He hurmphed, "I don't have your pretty smile."

I grinned at him.  "But you do, sir, you just need to smile more."  I held out my hand, "Nox Setanta, at your service.  If you'll let me know what's up with that Mercedes I can get the woman to calm down and come back later."

"I told her already.  She doesn't want to listen.  We need to order a part it won't be in until tomorrow."

I nodded.  "And what's her problem?"

"She needs her car now. Now, NOW! she said. Her insurance company is covering the rental but she wants her car back."

I grinned.  "Alright, what time should she come back tomorrow?"

"4pm would be good, when I'm not here."  Auto laughed.

"I can arrange that, if all goes as planned her car will be ready?"

"Yes."  He said flatly.

"What part needs to be ordered?"

Auto blushed, "It's a simple gasket, but apparently the last boy I had keeping inventory forgot to check those."

"Simple - no moving parts.  Show me."  I said.

He looked at Emily with a sideways glance and handed me a part that looked like a little donut.  "Is this what it's supposed to look like?"

"Yes and no.  It's not broken.""  He separated the rubber.

I smiled.  "A new one would be better instead of fixing that one right?"

He tossed it in the bin, "there is no fixing that."

I picked it up out of the garbage and took a better look at it.  Everything was simple enough, it was a rubber gasket, of a specific shape and thickness meant to keep hoses from leaking.  I replicated the pattern and wove the pattern into the exiting material and fixed all the rough edges while I was at it.  Then handed it back to Auto.  "Good as new."

I used that knowledge and made one from scratch.  It took a little while longer as Auto was investigating the one I'd already handed him.  When I handed him the new one he looked at me with stunned silence.  "And a brand new one."

"How did you do that?"

I shrugged.  "I'm Cesari.  I can make about anything if you give me enough time to figure it out.  I can't do mechanical parts at least not put together."

Auto yelled.  "Simon, install this gasket and lets get Ms. Smyth out of our hair.  Tack on an extra $30 dollar rush fee."

I chuckled to myself as Auto waved me to follow him.  "He'll do just fine Emily.  Tell Paul thank you and inform Elena she was better than her word.  Boy you come with me."

"Yes sir."  I followed dutifully.  

He introduced me to Simon and Gloria who were his kin.  He didn't say anything more than that.  He introduced me to their receptionist Betty his wife.  I smiled brightly at her as she pinched my ass when I passed her desk.

Auto informed me, "You're first task is to take inventory.  That jackass before you left it a mess.  After that we'll start teaching you parts, the ordering system and computers and all that."

I asked as Auto was heading back into one of the bays, "My hours?"

"Whatever you want to work boy.  We are easy here.  Just leave it with Bet."

I nodded.  "Alright."  I liked the idea of setting my own hours.

I looked at the hours of operation and decided to come in an hour earlier and stay an hour later.  I had no where else to be.  That would give me two 1 hour breaks if I only worked eight hours as Betty instructed me.

She looked at me odd when I handed her a schedule Monday thru Sunday.  "This for this week?" she asked.

"Every week." I said.

"You need to take a break."

I smiled.  "How many days do I have to work?"  

She shook her head.  "5 of the 7. most people like their weekends."

"Do I have to take them in a row?"  I asked.

She shook her head.  "Sunday and Wednesday then."

"You can take off whatever you want and you choose two odd days?"

I smiled.  "Sunday my boyfriend's family has breakfast together so I know he's not working.  And Tuesday night my favorite dance instructor offers open dance floor."

She frowned, "You have a boyfriend?"

"Is that a problem?" I asked.

"No son.  I didn't think a hunk of a man like you would be into men.  Not the way you handled Ms. Smyth."

I grinned at her, "I like women too.  I just happen to love this man very much.  And with my life straightening out maybe he'll make time to see me."

"Why wouldn't he?"

"Ma'am it's a very long story."

"If you call me ma'am again I'll swot your rear like my own children."

"Yes, Betty.  I will not."  I grinned at her.  

"Why are you taking two hour breaks instead of just working normal hours?"

I smiled.  "I like to stay busy.  And if I'm meant to keep inventory clean then I need a few hours of quiet."

Betty nodded and I left her to her work and I went into the parts room and sighed at the mess.  

But this was my new life.  I could get used to it. 

## Rogue Wolf

The rest of the day Auto showed me around and taught me how to use the computer system for inventory.   That night I made dinner for the entire clan. It was the first time I cooked for so many people. Elena was there early and watched as I learned my way around the incredible kitchen and made chicken florentine with a toss salad.  

This was how I spent the next week. I'd wake up, do my first workout and then make breakfast everyone.  I'd make lunch and pack them for those who wanted one, then head out the door.  I would do inventory for half the day then Auto would teach me all about the auto mechanic business.  But mostly I did the inventory and learned about the insides of cars.  I took two one hour breaks, eating lunch and small workout on the first then a full workout on the second - usually a nice long run.  When work was over I would make dinner, do another work out then pass out. 

I was still waking up from my nightmares always afraid for those I loved.  Dorian's life was always the one that woke me up.  I hurt every morning feeling his loss.  After one particularly bad one I decided I need to see him.  I knew it was too early but I sent Dorian a text.  I sent him my schedule and a note saying I'd like to talk.  I laid awake several hours but he never returned my text.  It was too early to wake up but I started my day anyway.  

By the end of my day I still hadn't heard from him.  I knew he was fine, but life moves on and I wouldn't dwell on it.  But there was really little time to do that.  It was three nights before the next full moon and Paul and the other wolves were decided where the best hunt would be while I finished the last of dinner.  Micahel, Paul's oldest son rushed into the sitting room they were using frantic.  His words were chopped and ragged while he tried to catch his breath. "Raf is changing in the middle of central park."

Paul shot up like a weed from his chair and looked at the men and women in the room, then looked at me.  "You have to help.  He's just a boy.  Before your friends find him."  Paul said your friends with a venom I hadn't heard from him when talking about the Venatori before it made me wonder what exactly might have happened in his past to hate us, but he didn't seem to mind me.

I wiped my hands and looked at Michael.  "Where is he exactly?"

Michael gave me the location he'd last seen his best friend.  I took my phone out and called Ant.  

He picked up, "Hey Nox, what's up?"

"Can you take me some place I don't have time to explain."

Paul took my phone from me and threw it across the room.  "We don't need vampire help."

He rushed out the door followed by his friends.

I used a pattern of air and retreivd my phone as I saw Ant walking in the front door with a sword of fire in his hands.  "It's alright, Ant.  But I stil need that help."

He only nodded as the flame disappeared.  "Let's go then."

We walked outside and he took my arm.  The shift always made me sick but I fought the feelings down.  I could hear the howling of a wolf near by.  It was too early for a change, but from what I understood it happened on occassion.  

Ant grabbed my shoulder again.  "You need help?"

I shrugged.  "I've talked down one wolf in my life not sure exactly how that happened.  But we can't kill him."

"Wouldn't dream of it."  Ant smiled at me.  "But you aren't doing it alone."

"Thanks."  We ran towards the growling, and where people were fleeing.  There wasn't many but wolves in the park that was dangerous and the city folk didn't want to be there.  Which was good.

We found Raf stalking something in the shadows.  I threw a rock in the general vacinity of him and he turned towards us.  Ant circled around behind him.

"Rafael, it's alright man.  Calm down. "  I wove walls of air around him and funneled him towards me.  I held out my hand and he sniffed the air and howled.  But he took a tenative step towards me.  I knelt down and kept my hand out.  Rafael's wolf was larger than I was, it was too dark to really tll what color he was, but his ambers eyes shown in the dim light from the moon.  He continued towards me with a low rumble in his throat.  

I thought about Jo and Rafael's attention changed.  He took another step towards me.  "Rafael, it's alright.  Calm down.  We got this."  He stepped into my hand and sniffed it before he pressed into it.  The rumbling died down and the large wolf pressed his head against my chest.  

I rubbed his head and the back of his neck and smiled.  Ant laughed softly behind the large wolf.  "Ain't you got talent."

A crowd of people stopped around us and I heard Paul telling them to go home.  I stared at Ant with hatred.  Raf laid down next to me and I rubbed behind his ears.  "Ant is my friend Paul, he isn't just any vampire."

"What did you do?"  He fell to his knees next to his son's best friend.

"I didn't do anything.  I was just here."

A man stood behind me and put his hand on my shoulder.  "As any good Alpha is." I looked up to find Adrian standing behind me.  "That's two now."

Paul stood up, "He was not meant for you Nox."

I frowned.  "Then maybe his would be Alpha should have been keeping better tabs on him."  I stood up and Rafael's wolf form followed me and Ant as we left.

Paul grabbed my arm and turned me towards him.  There was sadness in his eyes, "Thank you, Nox."  

I smiled.  "I am not like them, Paul.  I will save whoever I can however I can."  

The walk from Central Park was a lot longer than the journey to.  Ant left shortly after we started walking.  He said he had to prepare for the day's ambush.  War would start tomorrow if I couldn't talk my father down.  I took a day off.  Auto was more than happy to give me the day.

That night I slept in the family bed room with Raf and Jo curled around me.

I had a new nightmare one that I screamed as I boled awake.  Raf and Jo looked startled as I laid back down to conformt them.  Raf was back in his human form looking around groggy.  Jo was whispering in his ear and Raf was nodding.  I got up out of the family bed and headed out for a run.  

Before I was out the door Raf was dressed and joining me.  "I'm coming with you."

"Just going for a run."

Raf smiled.  "I know.  You are my Alpha now, right?  I mean I feel it.  You don't get to run with us so we are going to run with you."

Jo's hand slipped into mine as she joined us.

"Keep up then."  I really didn't have any doubts that they would, but they were werwolves after all, and I only had human speed.  

## Jumping the Ambush

Raf pretty much refused to leave my side the entire morning.  He helped me make breakfast and cleaned everything up for me.  As I was finishing the last of my coffee I said to Raf, "You don't have to follow me around. You have a life, I have a life and where I'm going next you can't come with me.  You are a kid, and this is dangerous."

"I'm not a kid."  Raf protested.

"You are.  And I can't let you come with me.  Raf, if the Venatori do what they are planning, there will be a war.  And we don't need the were's involved.  Ant won't hurt you and Marco probably not, but Bernstein he might.  And my father and Emilio probably don't care.  Please don't come with me."

Jo laughed.  "Just order him not to go."

I gave the small brunette a dirty look.  "I can't do that.  I won't do that.  We all have free will."

Jo frowned, "Adrian says that is not how Alpha's act.  Alpha's take control, they are control."

I laughed.  "No Duckling, that's Adrian."  I leaned closer to her and whispered, "He likes control, he's very into tying people up and spanking them."  I walked over to Raf and put my hand on his shoulder.  "I'm not going to order you anything.  But if you follow me and you get hurt it's all on you."  I walked out of the room with Jo still glaring after me for disrespecting the only Alpha she knew.  But it was completely the truth and she just didn't beleive me.

The meeting was supposed to take place in an abandoned subway station.  Someplace neutral, but not really, anything underground was vampire territory and if my father had paid any attention to the natural order of the city he'd have know that and not agreed to it.

When I arrived there were already vampires hiding in the tunnels, in the shadows, Ant and Bernstein were standing on the platform.  

I heard footsteps on the stairs behind me and saw my father and Emilio walking down.  My father was weilding fire around him.  He looked at me and frowned, "You can't be here boy."

"Yeah, see.  I don't follow **your** rules anymore Dad."  I threw a wall of fire between the two parties.  "See, you have enough fire power around you to scorch the place.  I bet the area is surrounded and you think the vampires came alone."

"Ant is the son of Il Cane.  He's got all sorts of vampires at his beck and call.  Tat can come in at the right signal.  Bernstein's men are hidding in the shadows."

"You are going to start a war."

Ant was smiling at me and my dad frowned at him.  "How did you hear about this Nox?"

"I have all sorts of connections.  Don't you know?  I'm Exuli Kai.  People talk to me."

Emilio frowned.  "I guarantee you Dorian told him."

"Actually no he didn't.  I received a note from someone else.  I've not spoken to Dorian since the night before I was exiled and we didn't exactly do much talking."

Emilio laughed, "I don't want to hear about your sex life, Nox.  Though Dorian's moved on, son.  You should too."

"Good for Dorian."  I said with a smile but inside it felt like my heart was being ripped out.  But at least now I knew why he wasn't contacting me back.

"Let's talk this out, or leave.  They didn't kill those people.  And you aren't going to kill them now.  I won't let you."

"Get out of the way Nox."  Kai squelched the flames in front of him.

I just grinned at him as a wall of air formed around the vampires and filled with smoke.  Bernstein cackled.  "Ant leave with your people now, I don't want any blood shed today."

"I will take mine, but I cannot vouch for Bernstein."  Ant echoed in the emptiness before he vanished into the shadows.

Bernstein laughed.  "Boy, why should I do what you ask.  They come to kill me.  I'd love very much to kill them."

"You owe me."  I said flatly.  But my father started throwing fireballs at the wall of air.

"He is persistant.  Your father."  He laughed.  "But this is over the debt I owe you, boy."

"Yes, and I will owe you if you leave today."  I promised.  "My word is my law."

"Oath's boy mean nothing from Venatori."  Bernstein sneered.

"I am not Venatori.  I give you my word on my honor and on those who I love."

The firing pounding on the shield of air around Bernstein.  "Fine boy.  You owe me one very large favor."

"Done."  I looked at my father as I let the wall of air fall and my father's fire flew through the smoke and scattered on the far wall.  "They are gone now.  Your quarry has run and you will not follow where they went Father."

Kai turned on me with fury and raised an arm to throw a fireball at me.  "You truly are a traitor."

"Call me all the names you like Father.  You will not start a war I can prevent.  Take your Venatori and hunt another night."  

Kai threw a fireball which I let stop inches from my face with a wall of air.  "Dad,.." I started to say.

"Don't call me that."  Kai yelled at me, "You are no son of mine."

"I finally call you Dad and you don't like it.  How ironic."  Kai threw more fireballs at me. Emilio tried to pull him up the stairs, but he shrugged his best friend off as the flames battered my shield of air.  I could feel the wall failing, the heat burning at my skin.  The next three balls of fire came at me with rapid succession.  One, the wall weakened to near collapse, the second and it fell without warning as the third one explode against my chest and everything caught instanteously on fire.  

I could hear the roar of the flames in my ears, I could feel the searing of my lungs as I took a breath and tried to scream.  Through the flames I saw my father fall to his knees in despair.  I could hear his scream of pain mingling with my own.  The pain was like nothing I had ever felt.
## Phoenix

There was nothing but flames and the pain.  I must have blacked out at some point because I woke up in the pack bed with Jo and Raf curled around me.  I knew someone else was there, but I didn't know who.  I sat up and felt my skin stretch as the newborn skin was taunt, it wasn't painful.  As a matter of fact there was no pain at all, just the presence tickling in the shadows.  

I created a low light ball above my head and in the corner sat the one person I hadn't expected.  His eyes were closed and his chest rose and fell with the shallowness of sleep.  Dorian shouldn't be here.

I moved toward the end of the large bed and Raf and Jo curled around each other with my presence gone.  I was a little cold now without their warmth.  I touched Dorian's shoulder and he stirred, looking up at me the started awake.  His wide blue eyes taking in the sight before him.  I smiled at him and took his hand.  He followed if a little slower than normal.  I lead him out back into the small garden where Emily planted roses and fresh herbs.  I sat down in the small patch of grass and waved for Dorian to sit in the lone chair the space had room for.

I asked softly, "What are you doing here? Your father said you'd moved on."

Dorian frowned.  "Why do you think I'm here?  Your father said he killed you.  They didn't stay to see your corpse.  I went to tend you and found nothing but ash.  I had thought the worst until Ant wisked me away to you. That is not a pleasant thing."

"You remember what they told me right?  I was immortal.  I guess we just proved it again."  I sighed as I laid back in the cool green grass that looked like black spikes sticking up from the ground.  I put my hands behind my head and stared up at the noise pollution blocking the view of the billions of stars I knew that were overhead.  "I'm fine Dorian, why are you still here?"

"I wanted to see you.  I..."  Dorian just stopped talking and when I looked over at him he was just watching me.

"You what, Dorian?"  I asked softly looking back up at the night sky.

"My father doesn't know the whole truth - I didn't move on, not exactly."

I sat up and looked at the man I loved and hoped that he had loved me back, but that felt like so long ago.  He frowned.  "Asher Eriksen came to me, told me what you were doing for me.  Told me what you were doing for Mark Green.  He said the only way to protect myself and my family was to move on.  He said it with a smile that indicated it would be a lie.  He told me that you'd arranged a child with Anabel Dowager, and she was willing to be a participant in an unsual means of conception.  Unsual for Venatori that is - humans do it all the time."

I smiled.  "My donations."

Dorian nodded.  "And to insure that my obligations were met, he had me marry Anabel, beget her son, your son and pretend like I had moved on.  I do not love her, Nox."

I smiled up at the sky.  "I know.  But I'm glad to her you say that.  You are going to be father my children?"

"At least one."  Dorian nodded though he looked sad.

"I can live with that."  I patted the ground next to me and Dorian slide out of his chair and laid down next to me, propping his head up on his hand staring down at me from his side.  I smiled at him.  "Why are you here?"

Dorian leaned down and kissed me tenderly.  "I've missed you."

"No one can know you are here Dorian.  Why risk these few moments?"  I asked then added, "Not that I mind seeing your beautiful face and those goregous eyes."

Dorian smiled, "Only the people here and Ant know where I'm at.  I left without saying a word to anyone and Ant wisked me away.  He loves you in that brotherly way you love Jason."

"I know.  We have a bit in common.  Kindred spirits and all that."

We sat in silence for a long time, just staring at each other without even touching.  Dorian smiled down at me, "Do you feel different?"

I shook my head, "No.  Skin feels tight but I suppose burning alive would do that to you."

Dorian stood up and offered me a hand and he lead me to my bedroom and stood me in front of the mirror.  He whispered, "Notice anything different?"

My hair was it's normal chocolate brown, all trace of color was gone despite the sapphire blue that had been in it when I went to meet with my father and the vampires.  And then I noticed the scar on my check was gone.  I touched the place it used to be tenatively and found nothing.  I could see Dorian smiling behind me as I pulled my shirt off, the scar on my forearm was gone as well and so was the werebear scratch across my chest.

I turned halfway and stared at what I could see of my back.  Every scar, every trama I had faced was erased by the fire.  Dorian looked at me with concern, "Do you feel different now?"

I spoke in a soft whisper, too afraid of my own voice, "There is nothing left."

"Nothing left on the outside Nox.  The scars run deeper than the flesh.  Do you feel different?"  He asked for the third time and I didn't hear any anger in his voice.

"I feel robbed.  No longer me."

"You are the same person, Nox.  The same man I love.  The same man who has tried to save countless supernatural lives.  The man who is standing her risen from the ashes like a phoenix."  He frowned, "The same man who I'm going to have to forget."

I turned and looked at him, "What do you mean?"

"The Venatori think you are dead now - well and good.  Asher thinks it's a good idea to let them think that.  I have informed him you were alright when I first arrived here.  He only laughed.  When he calmed down he told me to ask Ant to remove the memory of your survival.  To let me think you had died to make it beleivable.  They both gave me tonight to spend with you.  And I agree with them."

"So this is our last moments together?"

Dorian nodded, "Yes love.  And I won't remember them.  Please know that I love you."

"I know.  And I love you.  I understand.  I hate it but I understand."  I kissed Dorian.

His phone beeped.  "That's Ant.  I have to go love."

Dorian gave me one last kiss and smiled.  "Don't move on, Nox.  When it's over, all over, find me.  Tell me you love me and I will remember."

I nodded and watched Dorian leave my bedroom.  It felt like a hole being ripped through my heart.  I sat on my bed and I could feel the anxiety racing.  It wasn't long before Jo and Raf were helping me lie down and curling around me in my bed, it was barely big enough for me, much less three grown people, but somehow it worked and I drifted to sleep in a tangle of limbs thinking that I was going to drown in my sorrow.



## Meeting James

I woke soaked in sweet and tears to the sun streaming in my bedroom window alone.  I curled around my pillows and searched the nightstand for my phone, and when I couldn't find it I sat up and crawled out of bed.  Someone had removed it to let me sleep which meant I was late.

I walked down stairs without changing into anything, just the sweats and no shirt that I'd been wearing when I woke up to find Dorian in the pack bedroom.  I shivered as the cool air from the morning soaked into my skin.  In the kitchen I found Emily cooking for the clan and I felt a stab of jealousy, but there was a smile when everyone noticed me standing in the door way.  

Emily stopped what she was doing and wiped her hands on her apron and walked me to a spot at the bar for breakfast.  "You look worse than yesterday."

Raf was the one to answer, "Dorian told him last night."

I wanted to be angry, "Everyone knows already?"

Emily nodded, "That Dorian is getting married.  Yes, darling everyone has been keeping that secret from you for far to long."

"Seriously?"  I dropped my head to the table.  I sat up straight and resolved to do what I had to do.  "I'm going for a run."  Raf and Jo started to get up and I sighed, "Alone!"

They sat back down and nodded.  It hadn't been an order, but it felt like one.  I grabbed a hoodie and pulled on shoes and just started running.  I don't know how long I ran or how far I'd left my phone wherever it had been placed to let me sleep in.  It didn't matter I was exhausted and when I finally graced the door of the building I nearly ran into Elena as she was exiting.  "Sorry."

"I heard darling, I'm so sorry.  Come inside I was just looking for you."  She took me by the elbow and drew me inside into the living room, "Sit darling."

"I really need a shower Elena."

She smiled, "You are perfectly presentable.  Though the color is missing."

I grinned at her, "Fire does that when it burns away everything."

She nodded as if what I'd said was perfectly acceptable.  "James would like you to come to dinner tonight with Charles and I.  There will be other officers there.  You've moved in seamlessly into our culture and even taken it upon yourself to look out for others and you didn't have to.  And your recent interactions with the vampires and Venatori.  They'd like to know how far your connections go."

I rolled my eyes.  "My connections in the Venatori just died, I'm dead now."

Elena shook her head, "No darling it's not. You know how they work, where we can best make changes.  You have knowledge James wants to understand how much."

"Fine, what time.  I have to get to work I'm already late."

Elena laughed, "Auto's already cleared you'd a day off.  He said inventory can wait another day.  Besides you did just rise from the ashes, I think you can do with a day off."  Elena looked at Raf and Jo who were standing behind me as far as I could tell from the connection I had with them now.  She smiled at them.  "Take him shopping, on me."

Raf groaned and so did I.  But I was the only one who commented, "Really?  Because I like to wear make up, [aint my nails, color my hair and like men you think I'd enjoy shopping.  Do I look like I care who Versace is?"

Elena laughed.  "You should."

I rolled my eyes.  Raf laughed, "We could go to the gym.  Some of the other wolves go to a particular one that has boxing ring, we could go a few rounds."

Elena waved it away, "He'll get a black eye."

Jo snickered, "It's not like he won't heal, Elena.  He heals faster than we do."

Emily nodded, "It'll be good for him to get out and hit things.  A good outlet."

"Throwing fireballs would feel better, but I suppose a few rounds couldn't hurt."

Raf got up and ran up the stairs, Jo handed me my phone and I turned it off and stuck it in my hoodie pocket as I went up stairs to at least get presentable.  And yes I showered, threw blue and red and orange into my hair haphazardly and made sure the eyeliner was thick and waterproof before I was back downstairs in workout gear. 

Jo and Raf were standing downstairs waiting on me, Michael looked up at me and smiled.  "Of course he plays gay for the guys."

I laughed.  "I did it on purpose."

Elena giggled.  "I'm going to enjoy watching this."

Emily sighed, "Elena,  you could stay with me and we could chat."

Elena shook her head, "Not a chance, darling, I want to see our own Venatori up against a wolf in a fair fight."

I laughed as I started at a jog out the door, Raf sprinted past me and took the lead.  I called after me, "Who said anything about fair."

Elena beat us there with Jo and a few other of the clan who hadn't wanted to run with us.  Raf enjoyed running with me, so did Jo, but she went with Elena at Elena's insistance.

Jo was leaning against the wall next to the door and grabbed my arm before I went in and pulled me aside into the near by alley way.  "Elena's going to try and fix you up.  I refused her flat out.  But now that Dorian's out of your rear view mirror she wants you mated."

I sighed.  "Jo, Dorian isn't out of the picture, he never will be.  I need him more than I need air."

Jo nodded.  "I know.  But he thinks you are dead, and you need a mate if you want to stay Alpha."

"We'll deal with that as we have to."  We went inside together and there was already a match in progress.  I started warming up off to the side.  I didn't want to hurt myself, and I wasn't sure how much my body had truly healed from the fire.  I could feel every stretch as I moved.

Elena stood next to a large man with the aura of a were, I couldn't tell what kind, but everyone in this place was a were except me.  He was powerful, it made me wonder if he was an Alpha.  It would be interesting to know if I could see that just like I could see Magnus status.  

The bell rang and the loser hopped out of the ring and the man Elena was talking to jumped in.  He bounced around the ring several times before the bell rang and they started circling one another.

It started out like every boxing matched I'd ever seen, punch after punch and then the man Elena had been talking to did a round house kick to his opponents head and the man fell to the ground and didn't get back up.  

The other man's friends dragged him out, slapping his face and pouring water on him to wake him up and make sure he was alright.  I saw his chest rising and falling and knew he'd be alright.  The man left in the ring, he walked over to the edge neaest me and pointed at me, "I want the new guy."

Great.  I stood up and nodded and stretched my arms as I climbed into the ring with one quick motion.  I heard all sorts of comments as I put on the proofered gloves.  "Kill the pretty boy."  "Don't break a nail."  "Watch for the boner."

I just rolled my eyes and took a fighting stance in front of the man Elena had been talking to.  Before the bell rang I held out my hand and the other man bumped it and I smiled.  "Alright, let's get this over with."

I took a deep breath and wove air around my arms and legs to help with the defense.  I wasn't going to let this man break me because he was stronger than I was by default.  We danced in a circle for a good two minutes to the disappointment of the crowd, so I decided to have a little fun with it and set off a few fireworks on the outside of the ring.  The man turned to look and I swept his leg out from under him.  "Sorry man."

That was enough for him to go full bore on me.  He swung and I blocked.  He repeated the onslaught as we danced around the ring.  He tried to get me in a corner but I ducked out of his reach just in time and would smack him across the back.  I didn't play fair.  And he knew it, I saw the moment it switched.  He threw down the gloves and took off the head gear and I followed suit.  I wasn't finished removing the protective gear when he came at me swinging with a series of kicks I had to block, but the last one landed against my rib cage and I could feel the bruise that was going to form, but I dropped to the ground and swept his feet out from him and he fell to the ring floor, but he popped back up with a smile.

We traded blows for a while before a bell sounded and he reached across the ring with an outstreched hand, he was panting with the exertion and so was I.  "Hi, I'm James Wright.  It's very good to meet you Nox."

I smiled.  He was more than Alpha, he was **the** Alpha.
## Gaining Traction

James asked me to come with him and so I followed.  No one looked concerned.  I shouldn't have been, but I felt something - maybe it was nerves.  This was the guy everyone I currently knew listened to.  

He walked into the locker room and snapped his fingers and everyone left, except for us.  James did wait for the last straggler in the shower to vacate before he sat down on a bench and started untying his shoes.  "Garrett tells me you are dead.  And yet here you stand."

He looked at me with a knowing grin, "Tell me how the Venatori think one of their former hunters is dead and he is not?"

"I stepped between my father and a vampire meeting.  He'd come packing more than the agreement had stated, and the vampires knew of the betrayal before hand. So they were ready to start a war.  My father didn't like it so he tried to kill me.  He bombarded my shield of air with fireballs until he broke it and one landed.  I went up in flames.  I woke up in the pack bedroom with Raf and Jo curled around me."

"And your boyfriend sitting in the corner."  James added.

I nodded.  "The son of Il Cane gave him the remainder of the night with me before he would remove the memory of my survival.  It's better if the Venatori think I'm dead."

I could see that none of this was news to the leader of the CCB.  "And you are okay with never seeing your lover again?"

I shrugged, "No, but it is what it is.  It's not like I've seen him since I was exiled anyway."

"Very true.  You've left most of your old life behind.  Except those connections that you have used to help us."  James smiled.  "What should I tell Garrett then?"

"I'm sure he's figured out I'm not dead.  My death should remain standing.  Otherwise he'll be outed as having a connection to me.  And I don't think he wants that getting out."

James nodded.  "I will remind him of his place then.  Elena tells me you accuse him of childhood trauma."

"Nothing I can prove, and with the scars gone, that proof is even slimmer."

"But you still claim it."

"I know what I know."  I said softly.  "He manipulated me to break my control issues.  He used the one thing I feared most - being hurt, to make me spark, and when I did he'd punish me by my own hand, teaching me control as he did.  He succeeded in helping me control my ability.  But he still abused me in the process."

"And what would you have me do?"  James ask with his hand on his chin as if he were thinking of something to do to him - or to me.

"Nothing, honestly.  I'm over it.  I fear him.  But I'm no longer Venatori if he tries to harm me while I'm out here, he'll pay for it.  I'll kill him just the same and take the consequences of my actions as an Exuli."

"You could have killed him while you were Venatori why didn't you?"

I shrugged.  "I told you.  I was afraid of him.  I freeze every time he's around.  I'm not proud of my paralyzing fear, but one day I will conquer it and he will see the man he created in action."

James smiled.  "I will endeavor to keep him from you until that time.  We do not allow the abuse of our children, but it is your word against his, I'm glad you decided not to take action."

I shrugged.

"Why did you help the little wolf girl back in the Infirmary?"

"Because I could.  I was the only one capable of making sure she didn't hurt herself or me in the process.  The nurses would have tried to restrain her, but when she turned she'd have been freed.  Then they'd have tried to capture her and then they'd either scare her into biting or scratching them, or worse killing them.  And I didn't think Jo could handle that anymore than they could.  So I intervened."

"Even though she could have killed you?"

I smiled.  "I wasn't worried about myself honestly.  I've fought bears and wolves who were bigger and stronger than she is.  I had a wall of air between us for a good share of my advance towards her until I was sure she wasn't going to hurt me.  I'm not an idiot."

"You use your Magnus ability with ease.  More so than any other I've ever know.  It is what Elena brought to my attention first when you were on the stage in central park.  She said you flowed like none other.  Why is this?"

"Because I'm mostly human.  I don't have the speed nor the strength of a Venatori so in order to keep up I used all my other advantages to my best ability.  To most Venatori their mental ability and their Magnus ability is only icing on the cake, to me it it's my bread and butter."

James laughed.  "Why did you help Rafael when Paul didn't want your help?"

"He wanted my help.  He didn't want my vampire friends help."

"What use did you need the vampire for?"  He asked with his head to the side.

"I needed Ant to take me to the location quickly.  I arrived before they did because of Ant's ability to travel through the shadows.  I knew that the longer Raf was not contained that he would become a higher threat and the Venatori would come for him.  I got there, contained him and had him under control by the time everyone arrived and no one got hurt."

"Very smart.  How did you become an Alpha without the change? Not only did you control and console one, but two fledgling werewolves but you took one from another Alpha."

"I didn't know I had done that - taken him from someone else."

"Paul said he told you."  James sounded confused.

"No, Paul said to me that his Alpha should have done it."

James nodded.  "He is correct.  Paul was his Alpha.  He should have been there, should have taken control of the rogue wolf.  But you were already there, he was already calm.  Who did you do it?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know - honestly."

James smiled.  "Would you like to hear my theory?"

"Sure.  I love theories about my life."  I said dryly.

James chuckled.  "Your mother was attacked by wolves at a young age.  She survived and was taken in by the Venatori and taught to be one because of that.  It is known among our kind that some humans carry the dna of a wolf, but do not change themselves, but pass it on to their offspring.  But you were not wolf either because your Venatori genes kept it dormant."

"And when my immortallity kicked in, so did every other dormant gene in my body."  I said.  It was an intriguing theory. I would have to discuss it with Asher when I saw him  next.

James laughed.  "You don't beleive you had it before then, the abilitiy to be an Alpha?"

I shook my head, "No.  Someone remarked that I smelled like a forest, where I never had before."

James sniffed the air.  "You do, underneath the smokey campfire there is a distinct smell of wolf.  Emily says that it grows when your pack is nearer to you.  Paul is afraid you will take more from him - willingly or not he doesn't care, but it makes him weak in the eyes of some of his pack."

"I could step in and make you give what was rightfully his back, but I'm not a wolf and I dislike getting in the way of Alpha disputes.  How do you suppose we fix this dilemia?"

"I can find another home.  I can't afford much, but I'd leave if it'd make things easier."

James smiled.  "The sacrafice.  You have every right to the house assigned you.  You are more powerful than he is."

"Why do I want to cause problems?"

"Elena said you might be soft when it came to friends and family."  James sounded disapointed.

"I'm not weak.  I choose my battles.  This is not a battle worth fighting."

"Oh young one, but it is.  Paul has thought to challenge you.  He told me today before I informed them that I wanted to meet you.  He said he would challenge you before your power grew too strong and you took what was his.  This is the life of the wolves, and all other supernatural creatures.  Claim what is yours, Nox."

"Tonight, under the full moon I want you to challenge Paul for his pack.  Failure to do so will see your self out the door.  You must learn the ways of the pack or you will fall short in everything the CCB has to offer.  Protect what is yours."

I sighed.  "And this is a fight to the death?"

James nodded.  "Yes, my boy it is.  It must be.  To do otherwise is to show weakness."

"Are we still on for dinner?"

James nodded. "Elena has gone on and on about your cooking.  Will you cook for the clan tonight?  We would all like to watch the challenge and have a fantastic meal."

I could only nod.

James smiled.  "Then 6pm, we shall see what the young Alpha has in store for us.  I look forward to tonight, Nox."




## Moonlight Battle

I walked out of the locker room and everyone gave me a wide bearth as I headed for the door.  Raf and Jo followed at my heels.  It was like having two little love sick puppies.  But I was glad for the company.  

Once we were away from the gym I said what was on my mind.  "Paul is thinking about challenging me?"

Raf stopped dead in his track and when I stopped and turned around to look at him he was cowering.  "I'm sorry."

"It's not your fault.  Don't worry about it.  James says I have to challenge him, protect what is mine."

Raf nodded but he stayed a pace or two behind me.  I held out my hand and he took it and I dragged him even with me.  "I have to kill him?"

Raf nodded again wanting to hang back.  "And if I don't we all get thrown out.  James' decrees will stand."  I didn't need Raf to nodd to understand that it meant that they would have to come with me.  I wouldn't be supporting just myself, but my small pack.  

Jo added.  "If you don't challenge him, or he you, I imagine James will take care of it.  Even Adrian listens when James Wright tells him to do something."

I sighed, "I go from one home to the next and I'm expected to kill here too."

Raf lifted my hand to his heart.  "It is the way of the wolf.  Only the strongest survive.  You look weak because you can't shift.  You can't hold us in our natural states."

"I didn't even know you could do that.  I didn't know **I** could do that."

Raf smiled.  "You are so young yet so powerful.  Tonight is the full moon.  I want to watch with my human eyes as you defeat Paul.  Hold us tonight, Nox.  You have the power, just try."

I sighed.  "Fine.  How do I challenge him?"

Raf laughed.  "Nothing formal.  Paul Shaffer I challenge you for leadership of your pack.  That should do it."

Jo put her hand on my shoulder and we finished walking back home.  Emily looked at me with sorrow.  I frowned, "You heard?"

She nodded.  "I'd ask you not to, but James is the leader.  And disobedience is tolerated even less than Alpha disputes." She put her hand on my shoulder, "Good luck, Nox.  May the moon give you the power you seek tonight."

"And you Emily.  I'm sorry."

She gave me a weak smile.  "Nothing to apologize for Nox.  Nothing at all, it is the way of life."

I had already started dinner by the time people started arriving.  When James said the clan he meant the clan.  There were people with whom I had never seen before entering the house and taking seats.  I could feel the moon rising and I went into the pack bedroom with Jo and Raf and we sat in solitude while I found the power inside me to keep them human for the duration of the night.  

At first it was a struggle just to keep that focus and then once it clicked, once I felt the forest coursing through my veins I felt them and knew that I didn't need to maintain the vigil to keep them from changing.

It was a new experience.  When I walked out there were more people waiting around and eating  I hadn't had anything to eat yet.  I saw Paul out of the corner of my eye and he was edging past a crowd of people and I decided it was now or never.  Raf and Jo patted my back as I left them, they could feel my nerves.

I followed Paul into the game room where James happened to be talking to a very large man with long curly hair and ice blue eyes.  Elena was standing next to him, wrapped in arms.  That had to be Charles.  James nodded at Paul to turn around and I saw him go white.  I sighed.  He'd heard too.  

I wasn't shy but I stepped up next to Paul and spoke clearly if not overly loud.  "Paul Shaffer I challenge you for leadership of your pack."

I saw James smile from behind his glass of beer.  I heard the normal taunts from around the room, "Pretty boy's got balls."  "This should be easy, Paul's got him by shear muscle alone."  But I heard one voice stand out among the crowd, Elena laughed, "You haven't seen the pretty boy fight yet, have you."  She was mocking them and it made me smile.

James stepped up.  "Paul?"

"Accpeted."  He said flatly. His eyes were wide and his pulse was racing.  I could almost taste his fear.  That was a new feeling.

James smiled.  "Paul lead the way to the pack room, it is your house."

There were cheers and jeers coming from either side of the room when we were down stairs in a dark dank basement and I thought to myself I wish I'd known it was here, it was wet enough I could throw fireballs without leaving damage.

Paul stood at one end of the ring already.  The ring consisted of a red circle drawn on the cement.  I looked at James, "Other than to the death are there any other rules?"

James shook his head.  "No rules at all."

I nodded.  I wasn't going to clarify enough to say that I couldn't use my Magnus ability it was the only way I was going to win after all.  

I could feel the power of Raf and Jo pulsing through me.  I felt their heat, and their hunger coursing through my veins.  I could smell the sweat and the fear from my opponent.  I smelt the forest eminating from him, but it was weak compared to what I had around me.  I could smell Raf and Jo and nothing else.  

Paul snarled at me and I could see the wolf teeth in his mouth and the claws on his fingers.  He lunged at me and I side stepped him quickly.

I felt the power of the forest humming around me.  Not around me - in me.  It flared each time Paul came close and tried to rake me with his hands.  He snapped and growled and tried to intimidate me before he lunged and I caught him by the arms and held him away from me.  It wasn't easy he was stronger than I was.  I used his weight and his momentum to tumble us both to the floor and before he could right himself I had my hands and a weave of air around his head and I twisted hard and I heard the distinct snap of his neck.

I stood up and let the body fall off of me as I did.  There was a sudden surge of energy around me as those who were loyal to Paul knelt and their magic joined Raf's and Jo's.  I could feel Emily and Michael upstairs, and all those who knelt on the floor in the pack room.  James was glaring at a few who had not knelt.  There magic hung in the air.

I stepped between them and James and looked at him with a smile.  "Kneel or be knelt."

James smiled at me and I turned to the scragglers, only one still stood by the time I had returned their direction.  

The man stepped forward and yelled, "I challenge you."

I smiled.  "Accepted."
 
I started for my place on the circle but the man lunged forward with my back turned to him and I closed my eyes and wove a circle of air that he dove through and yanked at his neck and hung him before everyone else to see.  His neck snapped with the forcefullness of my weave and he hung limply before everyones eyes suspened by nothing.  

The eyes of my pack lowered and their heads bent further towards the floor.

James laughed.  "Not what I was expecting.  Are there anymore challenges?"  No one answered.  "Bury Paul honorably, Bret can rot with the fish."

James clapped his arm around me and lead me up the stairs.  "And none of your followers changed when they lost Paul's connection.  You have impressed me young one."  He sat me down at the bar where Emily was crying softly into Michael's arms.  "Emily, your husband died honorably.  There is nothing to cry over.  Feed your Alpha I'm sure he's starving."

"Yes, James."

## Overheard Quarrels

I was left alone in the kitchen with my meal.  Michael took Emily upstairs to her bedroom.  Celia was sitting in the living room playing with her dolls.  I heard her start crying and my heart sank.  I took my plate and sat down next to her.  She looked up at me with her blonde babie doll and another one I didn't know her name.  I know Celia probaly told me before, they were her favorites.  

I sat eating my food and she leaned against me and cried.  I put my arm around her and her tears fell harder and faster.  But she never asked me why I'd done what I had, or why her Daddy had to die.  I was thankful because I didn't really have a good answer.  It wasn't my survival.  It was the two that I supported, and now I not only supported them, but everyone else who was tied to me through the magical bonds of whatever it was.  

I finished my dinner and put the plate on the coffee table and lifted Celia up into my arms and held her against my body.  It wasn't long before Michael had joined me and was curled up on my lap fighting tears.  He was 18 and turned earlier than most young werewolves.

I heard crying in the corner under the stairs and I shifted Michael to sit up and he scotted to the edge of the couch and put his head against the arm and watched me as I carried his little sister with me to kneel at the opening in the stair well storage.  A little boy cried.  "You okay?"  I asked.

He looked at me with large brown eyes, tears running down his cheek.  He snuffled as he spoke, "My daddy died today."

"I'm sorry."  I held out my hand.  "You want to come sit with us?  Celia and Michael's dad died today too."

He nodded his head and took my hand and I led him back to the couch and he settled in against my side and Michael curled up again in my lap.

I sat there with three sad children and the pack nodded their acceptance as they left the house to return to their own residences. Some went up stairs to their rooms but most left.  Elena sat down in the recliner chair and smiled at me as I held the kids who'd lost their father's today.  She looked proud of me.  She whispered, "Tomorrow you need to wear silver and gold in your hair."

I smiled, "Yes ma'am."

"No more ma'am Nox.  You have a much higher place than I do now.  Elena is fine."

"Okay, Elena it is."

She smiled at me again, "I'm proud of you.  I was worried that your attempt on Mark Green might have dulled your senses for the right thing.  Paul was a good man, but he was weak.  The pack needs strength to survive."

I sighed.  "I have no idea what I'm doing Elena."

"I will help you."  Elena leaned back and closed her eyes.

I could hear people talking in the kitchen, they were speaking in hushed tones I could barely hear.  But I heard my name being spoken louder than the rest.  I concentrated on the conversation.  I hated eavesdropping but this was about me.

"James, he's just a kid, and he's not even a werewolf.  He can't be a pack leader."  I didn't recognize the voice.

"Nox, is Venatori, or at least half.  He is capable of this job Charles.  If you doubt my judgement why didn't you challenge him."

Charles snorted, "He cheated."

"How do you figure?" James asked.

"He used his magic.  You saw how he just hung Bret like that."

James laughed softly.  "Bret was a fool, he tried to jump him while he had his back to him.  The boy hunted us for a living before he got here.  He knows what he's doing.  He knows things Charlie.  He can help I know it.  And not because Garrett says so, because I've seen it.  He personally knows the son of Il Cane.  I'd bet he'd be able to get in touch with Il Cane herself if we asked him to."

"We don't need vampire help."

"Of course we don't, but it's the principle of the matter.  He knows his way around the AU building.  We can pump him for information.  The plan still stands.  He doesn't like the Venatori anymore than we do.  And even if he did, we won't tell him the whole plan."

Charles lowered his voice further, "I still think just blowing up the building would be faster to rid us of their foul tempers.  They are starting wars with the vampires, if that little boy hadn't stepped in the world would be on fire right now."

James laughed, "All the more reason to keep the boy close."

Charles and James walked out of the kitchen with James' arm around Charles' shoulder.  Charles left his friend and took Elena by the hand.  "Are you ready beautiful?"

Elena beamed up at him with her eyes still closed.  "Yes, Darling."  She stood with Charles' help and smiled at me.  "Tomorrow I will give you a run down of your responsiblities as Alpha of a pack this large."

I nodded.  "Thank you Elena."

James nodded.  "In the mean time, tend to those who feel the pain the most."

He glanced down at the kids in my arms.  "It seems Elena has already started you on the right path."

Elena laughed.  "He did that himself, James.  He was already holding them when I came to sit down."

James put his hand on my shoulder and squeezed.  "I knew I was right."

The three of them left and Raf and Jo came into the living room and each of them took one of the little ones.  "We'll help get them ready for bed.  You go check on Emily."

I nodded.  I put my hand Michael's shoulder, "Sleep in the pack bedroom, I'll be down in a bit."  He smiled and nodded then headed to his own bedroom to change.

I found myself standing outside of Emily's door knocking softly.  Raf passed me with Celia in his arms and just turned the knob, "You are Alpha."

I sighed, but I walked in.  I found Emily lying on her bed with a knife from the kitchen contimplating slitting her wrists.  I sat down on the end of the bed and stared at the clothes hanging on the back of the door.  I spoke in a near whisper.  "I've been there before.  When I was eight.  I slit my wrists.  I hated being me then.  I was small, human and I was nothing special.  The only thing I accomplished with my suicide attempt was a stigma that I would kill myself at the drop of a hat and a very bloody bed that didn't get replaced for several years."

Emily had moved closer, the knife still in her hand.  "How did you get through it?"

"I had help.  My best friend had found me, I was mostly healed by the time he'd come in, but he called for help and I was taken to the Infirmary.  Then Margo, my therapist of two years at that point, helped me find the good in life, taught me to conquer my fears.  Fear is what made me do what I did.  Fear of the unknown.  Fear I'd fail miserbly.  I was afraid of everything.  My mother had done a number on me and I was still and am still dealing with residual feelings."

"You've not been seeing a therapist since you got here, you seem well adjusted."

I laughed.  "I'm a good actor.  Last night Raf and Jo slept in my bed comforting me.  If you hadn't noticed I sleep down there more often than not.  Being alone hurts, and now more so."

Emily put her hand on my leg slowly and I pulled her close, she curled against me like the kids had done.  "I'm not that strong.  Adrian has been listening to me and you and Elena have helped a great deal."

We sat in silence for a while.  "If you let me I can help you through this.  I can't replace your husband, and I don't want to.  But we can get through this together - that's what pack is right?  Family."

She sat up and kissed my cheek.  "Yes.  I will be right down, I think we will all be in the pack bed tonight."  Emiily handed me the knife.  "Thank you Nox."

"Anytime Emily."

I had too much on my mind to really think about what I overheard.   All these knew presenses in my head were distracting.  But for the first time without Dorian the others in my mind kept the nightmares at bay.  At least my usual ones.  I still had nightmares, or someone did, I wasn't sure if they were mine or not.## Leader of the Pack

The Shaffer family and Bret's son, Jordan, slept with Raf, Jo and myself that night, all curled around each other in what I can only describe as a puppy pile.  It was my first non-demon related nightmare I'd had in a long time and I wasn't the only one waking from it, Jordan was sitting wide eyed in the darkness and I pulled him on top of me to soothe his fears.  I don't know if it was his nightmare or mine, but I suspected it was his.

Elena came by early and had breakfast with us.  She walked with me to Auto's garage where I found the old man sitting down in Betty's desk looking over my schedule.  He smiled once he saw me.  "You are going to have to adjust this schedule of yours.  There are things you need to do at specific times."

He stood up and frowned, "Weekly isn't going to cut it now, boy.  You are going to have to plan month at a time.  Will that help you stay sane?"

I smiled, "As long as there some regularity to my life I should be fine.  Thanks for remembering."

Elena was looking at me curiously.  "Anxiety?  What else?"

"I was diagnosed with PSTD as a child, it's not really an issue now, but it was in combination with OCPD.  Side affects were anxiety and depression.  As long as I keep change to a minimum I'm usually okay."

Elena laughed, "Minimum, that's going to be hard, Nox.  This life is not some standardized test like the Venatori."

"I know.  It wasn't in the field either, but I managed.  At least now, unlike in the field, I have people supporting me full time."  I squeezed her hand, "And for that I'm grateful."

For the next few months I learned all about the pack.  I met every single member in my metaphyscial connection on an intamate level.  Elena insisted that I have dinner with everyone no matter their age.  So everyone came to the pack house, and we talked while I made dinner for two and then we ate in the privacy of the kitchen while everyone else had whatever Emily cooked that night.  There was some grumbling as I wasn't cooking for them too but Emily told them things would return to normal when the introductions were done.  I even had dinner with the newest member of the pack, a three month old name Aaron.

There were only a few young men in the pack that were going to cause me grief and mostly because they were homophobes.  The first thing out of one of their mouths before they sat down at the bar with me was I don't suck cock.  

I laughed and replied.  "I didn't ask you to.  And if that is the first thing you think of when you say I'm gay then you truly are a little delusional.  I like cock and prefer it in other orafices."

He gave me a gruttal cry of disbelief that I would be so bold.  I washed my hands of the hamburger I'd been kneeding at and offered, "Let's start over.   My name is Nox.  You must be Harvey. "

He took my hand and shook too firmly trying to show how tough he was. I gave as good as I got.

Elena and Auto sat with me every night teaching me the hierarchy of this pack and other packs in the City and in relation to the whole country.  They also instructed me in the overall politics of the CCB.  Helping navigate the pitfalls of most pack leaders.   The fact that I knew vampires personally helped a great deal.  

I had pack leader meetings to attend every week and I was invited to attend officers meetings where James asked me about the Venatori. I gave them what wouldn't hurt my family and friends.  But the more time went on the less I felt the need to project anyone other than Dorian.  I missed him a lot. I had a feeling I was going to miss him a lot for a long time. 

Nothing James asked me worried me not even with the thought that they had plans to do damage to the building. That worried me more the longer I saw the hatred for the Venatori. But I hadn't heard anything about any plans. But I kept listening anyway.  Some one, some where wanted Mark Green dead.

Elena had been true to her word and was setting me up with women from inside my pack, and others from outside. There was Tiffany who was a blonde bombshell but with the brains of a peanut.  Even Elena rejected her once she opened her mouth.

Sandra was a pretty little brunette, but she was much too butch for my tastes, her hair was cropped short, she had more muscle than I ever would, and she liked women.  She figured since I liked men it would be a good match.  I informered her I liked women and she sneered at me with a disgust that some people had against bis. They beleived that we should choose a side.  She was rejected on that fundamental disagreement.

Allison was not pretty in the sense that she a good looking woman.  With a little work she could be be drop dead gorgeous but she chose to wear her hair long and straight or in a pony tail.  Her glasses were several seasons out of fashion, and her attire was the same.  I didn't mind that she was homely at first glance, actually it was one of the reasons I agreed to see her.  But we didn't get far on that first date.

Allison was a relgious woman.  She was raised a strict Catholic.  Pre-maratial sex was a no-go for her.  And while that wouldn't have been a turn off, the fact that Elena inisited I follow the old tradition of inpregnating as many women as possible and whoever produced the first male heir was to be my mate.  While I didn't intend to do it per tradition exactly I wasn't exactly looking for love so it was a sensible solution.

And I wouldn't even have considered searching for a mate if Elena and Auto hadn't agreed that a proper heirarchy inside my pack would make my life easier and the fact that I wasn't a werewolf proper allowed me to delgate the parts necessary to those who cold actually shift.  So I searched for women I could tolerate for life.  

Allison excluded herself from the selection the moment she found out about the heir situation.  But we'd had a good time up till then.  And I asked her to stick around and help me with some of the more intellectual members of the pack.  I had doctors and lawyers and several techies that liked to talk over my head.  Allison agreed to stay for a little while and help defuse the situation.

And then there was Isabel Reyes.  She was a spit fire that most pack leaders had rejected because she never followed the rules.  Elena rejected her on those rejections but when she saw the look on my face when I heard she didn't follow the rules, she brought her in anyway.  Isabel was a kindred spirit.  She rebeled against her family of traditional werewolves who did everything by the book.  She was game for the whole let's produce an heir.  She was more than just a pretty face though, Isabel had a great head on her shoulders.  

In the month that I dated her she brought to my attention more little problems that would have caused major problems if I hadn't dealt with them while they were small.  She also pointed out that Allison was the one causing the intellectual problems.  Isabel had made friends with all the old possiblities and none of them had been allowed to stay in the pack.  They were causing all sorts of problems with the men.  Namely they were saying that they'd been the leaders mate and that gave them certain rights.  So they had to go.

Elena was happy with the dynamic between Isabel and I.  And she and Auto agreed that she was perfect even with all the rejection from the other pack leaders she'd seen before.  Her family was from a small pack from New Mexico and if she produced a male heir then that pack would become mine.  It wasn't something that I had wanted but Elena snapped up the offer the moment Isabel's father suggested it.  Power she said was worth any price and she sang another tune.

Elena called after me as Isabel and I were leaving the conference room we'd called her father from.  "Nox, darling.  Can we talk?"

I turned and waved my hand as I had other things to take care of.  My life hadn't gotten easier being pack leader it became even busier.  "Without Isabel, sorry dear." She said to Isabel with a smile.

I shrugged.  "You know I'll just tell her anyway right?"

She sighed.  "Alright then.  The pair of you should just become man and wife witout the whole male heir."

"But you said..."  Elena interrupted me when she laid her finger to my lips.

"Darling, I know what I said.  But that was before we met the lovely Isabel.  She is the perfect counterweight.  She sees things you do not.  And you get along with her, there is only one thing holding you back."

"And what is that?"  I asked.

"Dorian."  Elena said crisply.

Isabel stepped in front of me, her short stature barely coming to the middle of my chest and still two or three inches shorter than Elena.  I couldn't see the smile that splayed on her face but I knew it was there.  "I know all about the love of his life, Ms. Elena.  Nox is an open book.  He can love the man and be married to me.  If ever they want to play house again I'm open to it.  The pack be damned."

"Dorian is not an obstacle.  It may become an issue down the road, but Dorian is married and having children with her.  He's not waiting around for me, pining after my dead soul, so I don't hold out much hope for a future with that ghost of my past no matter how much I will love him until I die."

Elena snorted, "If you ever die..."

I grined at her, "Yes, there is that.  If you think the pack will be alright with it, I'll bring it up at the next moon."

"You are growing into such a leader, Nox."  Elena squeezed my hand as she left Isabel and I together.  We were off to see about a few orphans that had been seen in Central Park that were thought to be were's of some sort but no one could get close enough to the feral children. So Isabel and I were going to try.


## Children

One of the best things about Isabel was that she enjoyed the life I lived - everything including going for a run instead of walking or taking the train to Central Park where we were going to look for the kids.  It was close to sunset and they would be hanging out in the woods there trying to stay away from the police and others looking for wayward souls.

Isabel slowed to a walk ahead of me and I smiled as she turned to wait for me.  She laughed, "Why do you always fall behind?"

I smiled and licked my lips and took her by the shoulders and we walked together like a proper couple through the wooded path the kids had been last sighted at.  I could see her smiling as we walked, "You still didn't answer me."

"You know why."  I grinned at her.

"I want to hear it."

"I like watching you move."  I squeezed her shoulder against my side affectionately.  We had been sleeping together on a regular basis for the past few weeks, but it was casual, nothing serious.  It was all about the heir, even though we had a great deal of fun preforming our duties.

She sighed as she leaned against me, "Do you ever compare me to Dorian?"

"Never."

She stopped and looked at me quizically, "Why not?"

"Well the obvious reason is he's a guy.  You don't exactly have the parts he does, nor he you.  It's not fair to either of you."  I said flatly and walked past her scanning the trees for the kids we were looking for.

"You love him though.  You can't love me - like ever?"  she asked nervously.

"I do love you.  If that's what you want to call what we have."  I took a few more steps forward then turned to face Isabel and her dark eyes shining with tears.  "I don't do relationships at least not before Dorian.  He's my first love, he will always be that.  Yes I love him.  But that doesn't mean I don't have room to find love with you.  I enjoy your company.  I want to make you happy.  I care a great deal about you.  None of these things have ever happened to anyone other than you and Dorian.  So that... " I waved my hands in the space between us, "this... is a good thing. You accepted the fact that I like men - and specifically Dorian.  Izz I am not going to have sex with anyone other than you."

"Except Dorian."  Isabel added.  She closed the distance between us.  "You can't make that promise to me and not include Dorian Nox.  I accepted that, not that ou liked men.  If you seriously want to make us official Nox, Dorian is included in the two of us.  He has to be, or you'll die of sorrow.  I'm not blind to your nightmares.  Your dreams are wrapped up in him.  They center on your demons hurting him now.  They are what peirce through the din that the pack creates in your head.  Everyone sees it on a preferial level anyway - we all know what Dorian means to you."

"I'll make whatever promise you wante Izz.  I will be faithful to you - and to the memory of Dorian.  Elena wants a strong woman by my side.  Auto agrees that you fit the bill.  When they agree I need to listen right?"

Isabel laughed, "Yeah.  But is that why you'd make this official?"

I shook my head.  "No ma'am.  I wasn't lying when I said I do love you.  It's just not the all consuming love I have for Dorian.  I want this with you.  Son or not."

Isabel wrapped her arms around my waist and pulled me in the direction of the woods, "Oh, we'll have a son."  She sniffed the air and I caught the shimmer of her shifting into wolf form.  Her gray and white fur standing stark in the dim light of dusk.  I picked up her clothes and tossed them in the bag we'd brought for just that occassion and I followed the female wolf through the woods, she'd found their scent.

We walked into what I could only describe as a homeless camp - except there was nothing but children here.  No one was older than 15 from the looks of it.  When Isabel's wolf form stepped into the fire light surrounding them most of the children scattered.  I tried to catch one before he ran past me but he slipped through my fingers as I closed them.   But two remained staring at me and not at Isabel's wolf form.  Neither of them moved.  I knelt down on the ground and Isabel laid down with her head on my knee watching the boys carefully.  

I held out my hand to them.  "My name is Nox.  This is Isabel."  I rubbed behind Izzy's ear and she gave a satisfied growl which made the boys take a step back.  "You know what I am?"

They shook their heads.  I asked, "Do you know what she is?"  Again they shook their heads.  "Do you know your parents?"

Again they shook their heads.  "Why didn't you run with the others."

The smaller of the two boys started waving his hands around like I should understand.  And then I realized he saw my power.  He wasn't a were I looked deeper and while he wasn't Venatori he saw auras.  A human child with the gift.

"Can you talk? either of you."  The smaller boy nodded as did the other boy.  "I can help you, but I need to know if your parents know where you are?"

They shook their heads.  The bigger boy spoke in a whisper, "They are dead.  Killed by..."  He pointed to Isabel.

"Izzy didn't kill your parents.  But we can figure out who did, if you want to come with me.  We'll give you a hot bath, hot food, some clean clothes, a warm place to sleep and help you figure out what's going on."

They both nodded.  I was sure that they didn't care so much about the offer of help as they did for hot food.  "Alright.  We need to wait for Izzy okay?"

Isabel took the bag in her mouth and went to a nearby bush and shifted again.  I was starting to learn that not all werewolves could shift on command.  Isabel could, so could Auto and Elena.  But it was a sign of power.  Another reason Elena approved of Isabel.

Isabel stepped out wearing her jeans and my t-shirt that was in the bag and I grinned at her.  The boys were staring at her with wide eyes.  "She's a werewolf."

"Yeah.  But she's not the bad kind."  I took Izzy's hand and kissed it softly.  I held my hand out to the boys and the bigger one took it and he took the other boys but he stayed put as we started walking.  

I stopped and offered him my hand and he took it and I scopped the small one up into my arms and carried him.  Isabel's hand on my waiste and the other boy holding my hand.

When we got back to the pack house there was a crowd outside.  No one was supposed to be here.  There were no meetings, but the talking stopped the moment I stepped into the light of the street lamp outside our front door.

The kids held tightly to me and I heard Isabel growl.

"Am I interrupting something?"  I asked playfully.

Isabel's hand tightened on my waist, she felt trouble.  I wasn't worried.  I reached for my ability, which now was carefully entwined with the magic of the pack and I let it flow all around me.  Isabel dropped to a knee as she steadied herself against me, she felt the power and bowed to it but not out of fear.  

The others, they bowed out of fear.  There was no respect in their eyes.  One man stood amongst the others.  "You aren't one of us.  I challenge your authority over the pack."

"I accept."

The crowd parted and I noticed that James was standing in the doorway.  But the man didn't wait for me to go down stairs, he attacked me in the dim lights of New York City.  I sighed and I snapped his neck as he rushed me.  If they weren't going to play fair neither would I.

I looked at the rest of the men in question.  "Are there anymore tonight?  I seriously hate losing good men."

When no one answered I walked through carrying the little boy and the other followed on my heels.  Isabel followed him but no man moved from their spot on the ground cowering before their Alpha.  I had been challeneged nearly every week since I became Alpha, "You'd really think they'd learn." James said as I walked past him.

"You'd think."  I called out into the house.  "Emily can we get some clean clothes and a bath for these two?"

Emily stepped out of the kitchen with a surprised look on her face.  She took in the dirty children and wisked them away like any mother would.  I turned back to James, "I assume you are here for me?"

He nodded. "In private."## Direct Course of Action

Isabel kissed my check and I followed James into what had become my office after Paul's passing.  It was the pack leader's office but it remained very much Paul's for the moment.

James sat in the comfortable office chair and looked up at me as I sat on the edge of the desk not exactly giving him the height advantage he wanted.  He frowned at me.  "You still rebel at our ways."

I smiled at him.  "That surprises you?"

He shook his head.  "No.  You defer when necessary.  Otherwise you are as cocky as the man outside."

"I'm not stupid enough to challenge you James.  I could beat you in a fight I don't doubt that, and neither do you, but I don't think the CCB as a whole would take to my winning that way and I would be assassinated.  And I really don't want your job.  I'm having difficulting be the leader of one pack, I can't imagine the trouble of being the leader of all the packs and then some."

"A smart boy."  James smiled.  "You are keenly aware of the Venatori buildings and of the Venatori's treatment of our kind."  James emphasised our as he included me in the statement.  It was rare that I was lumped into them like that even by James who had pulled me in this direction.  "The snake must die for the rest of us to die.  If they were leaderless would the snake die."

I shook my head.  "No someone would step up to lead them in even more hatred for the supernatural.  My father called me traitor for stopping a war.  Killing Mark Green will be like killing the Hydra by cutting off a head. You will only make it more aggressive."

James nodded.  "Charles agrees with you.  I'm inclined to beleive it then."

"Charles hates the Venatori for personal reasons.  He doesn't see clearly on it.  But he is correct in this.  The Venatori will unite against anyone who comes against it."

"Who's side do you stand Nox Setanta?" James asked.

"On the side of those I care about."

James laughed, "And that is smack dab in the middle isn't it?"

I nodded.  "It always will be.  Dorian, Jace... Margo and even my father will always tie me to them despite what they are.  I cannot choose a side in this."

"I am forcing your hand Nox."  James tapped his watch, "In one days time, exactly to the hour, a bomb will go off at the sublevels of the Apex Unlimited building it - leveling it to the ground.  I will not tell you where they are or when they will be placed only that they will.  You have a choice to make.  Make the wrong one and your pack with suffer."

James didn't wait for me to respond he walked out of my office and out of the house with less ceremony than he'd come in.  I sat in silence until Isabel came in, "What's wrong?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing you can help me with."

Isabel shut the door behind her.  "Tell me."

I looked at her with her big brown eyes showing all the concern in the world.  "The CCB plans to wipe out the Venatori."

"That's not news."

I added softly, "Tomorrow night.  They plan to bring their home down on top of them."

Isabel frowned.  "This has to be a game.  To test your loyalty.  James wouldn't kill an entire people.  We are not the Venatori."

"Survival of the fittest.  It's the law of the CCB.  The very law of nature itself.  He will and I have no doubt about it.  But you are still right, it is a test."

"What are you going to do?"

"What is right."

"What's that Nox?"  She asked as I was getting up to leave.

"It's better if you don't know what I plan to do Isabel."  I took her chin in my hand and I kissed her softly.  "I love you, but you can't come with me."

"You will order me if I come won't you."

I nodded.  "Please don't make me."

She nodded and I turned to leave.  "Nox..."  I turned back to her a few steps away.  "Don't leave us to die at his hands."

I smiled.  "Never."

I went to my room and I pulled out a card I'd saved for Asher.  We'd been communicating through messages at the donation center I frequented on his behalf, but he'd left me an emergency contact.  I sent him a text.  [i]CCB plans to blow the building up.  I will stop it, but just in case I fail evacuate by tomorrow night.[/i]

I texted Ant.  [i]Make Dorian leave the AU building.  Take him and his family far away.  Tell Jace to stay home.[/i]

When I opened my bedroom door Isabel was standing outside getting ready to knock.  I grinned at her.  "I'm not going anywhere."

She smiled.  "I was afraid you would run to tell them."

I waved my phone.  "They can take care of themselves.  We need to speak to Elena."

"She's down stairs."

"Bring her to my office.  I'll be there in a few moments."

I knew what I had to do, and I would save both families if I could.  But I would at least die trying.  I sent one last text before heading to the office where the two women would meet me.## A Quicky

Both Elena and Isabel were talking loudly in the office when I entered.  They both turned to see who had interrupted their discussion and they both relaxed visibly.  "Nox you aren't going to do something stupid are you?"  Elena asked.

"Yes, Elena I am.  But I have questions first.  You can answer them."

"Nox..."

I interrupted Elena, "Duckling, look I have to do this.  No one else can."

It was Isabel who spoke next, "Nox, you can't do this.  You'll leave us to the wolves almost literally."

"No I won't.  You are strong."  I turned to Elena.  "If the Alpha dies, his mate takes the throne until a new Alpha is made yes?"

Elena nodded.  "Made isn't the right term, but yes, a male can step in and kill the mate taking the power.  Which is usually what happens."  She paused, "But you are unmated Nox."

"Am I?"

Elena looked to Isabel and then back to me.  "Darling, she can't possibly stand up to the people who hate you."

"She can and she will.  I will see to it."

Isabel asked, "How?"

I smiled.  "By getting Il Cane to stand beside you."

Elena gasped, "You can't let vampires get involved in pack business."

"I can and I did. If it means that Isabel holds the pack until she finds a suitable mate to pass the pack to.  Isabel is strong of her own violition, with Cari beside her no one will hurt the pack, not even James not unless he wishes war with the Vampires and the remaining Venatori."

Isabel sighed, "He's already decided Elena.  You will not sway him."

Elena nodded, "Then there is only one thing left to do."

I knelt down on one knee in front of Isable.  "Isabel Reyes, will you marry me?"  I held a jet black ring on my palm.

She took it between two fingers and looked at it cautiously, "You made this didn't you?"

I grinned, "But of course. I was in a hurry."

"It's perfect.  Yes.  Nox.  I'll be your wife."  She slipped the ring on her finger and kissed me.  She turned to Elena as she pulled me to my feet.  "Marry us."

Elena nodded and the door opened to the office and Raf and Jo stepped inside.  "Nox..."

I winked.  "They are tightly bound.  They are easy to call.  They will keep the secret Elena.  Can you?"

Elena nodded.  "You are my creation, I will support you even if it means going against Charles."

"I'm not choosing sides Elena.  I'm taking over."

Elena nodded.  "I know."  There was saddness in her voice, but she of all people understood the ways of the pack.  

The ceremony was supposed to take place under the full moon, but we'd deal with the complications of the magic.  Elena prepared the office space with my help.  There were elements that she needed that I could create.  She was surprised by my knowledge of natural things.  Dead I could create - living was not a possiblity.

At midnight the simple ceremony of ancient magic no one really understood except the priestess of the packs of which Elena was.  There were no words to be spoken - a sharing of blood and meat and we were one.  I could feel the bond between us stronger than before.  

Elena smiled.  "The pack will not be happy to be left out of this, but after you do what you need to do Nox.  You will do this properly."

"Yes ma'am.  A large party and everything - running naked in the woods if I must."

Isabel laughed, "I bet he'd even like that."

I stuck my tongue out at her and she smiled.  Elena nodded.  "It is my pleasure to know you Nox.  And even a greater pleasure to stand by your side."

Isabel and I were given privacy which we took advantage of the newly formed bond. The magic involved in the mating ceremony lingered with us and a child would take root, or so the legend said.## Taking a Stand

I woke as usual with nightmares this time I was looking at my own death and how many people it would affect.  Isabel was wrapped around me, both of us still naked from our romantic wedding.  I unfurled from her and pulled on a pair of boxers and jeans before leaving to go outside to the garden.  My phone beeped with a text message and I looked down to see the word 'move'.  I took a side step and in the shadows Il Cane presented herself among the rose bushes.  

The small vampire crouched in the bushes and looked up at me as I towered above her.  I sat on the cold wet grass and smiled at the dark eyes beauty before me.  Ant was a more masculine version of his mother, and he was beautiful.  She spoke softly, "You will adhere to the bargin, Ascendant."

I nodded.  "If I die, you will protect my people as one of your own?"

She nodded.  "If you live, you come when I call for eternity."

I nodded and held out my wrist to the Hound.  She actually smiled, her fangs glinting in the night as they sank into my wrist.  There was a brief moment of esctasy before it faded into the dull ache of wanting.  I drifted in the moment thinking of Dorian and Isabel and how complicated things could become.  But I would save them both!

Cari let go and frowned.  "Spiraling into the depths of love?"

I smiled.  "You have no idea."

Cari nodded, "I do.  Tony is not always easy to love nor I'm sure you can surmise am I."

"But he does - love you."

"Yes.  And I him in my own way."

"Thank you Cari."

Cari bowed her head slightly, "It's is my honor to serve."

I bowed my head, "As it is mine.  I will come when you call until the day I die."

Cari smiled, "Do not die too soon, Ascendant."  And with those parting words she was gone the same way she came.

Morning came and I had Emily make breakfast as I left for the main compound where I knew James was.  I left alone, but I knew people had followed.  I could feel them trailing me.  It wasn't threatening, it was a solid backing.  My pack had my back even though they would regret it if I made the wrong choice.

But when I walked up to the compound door the entirety of my pack waited.  They parted, those closest to me patting my back or touching my arm.  It was a show of support.  I wondered how much they had been told and how much had come through the bond we all shared.  I was not werewolf, but I was still their Alpha.  Even those I knew who didn't like me were standing with me.

To my surprise there were others here as well, Ant and Marco stood in the shadows.  Il Cane was not too far as I saw Ryan standing among the people in the crowd.  Her chevalier never traveled far from her sight. 

I walked into the main doors of the compound and there was a sort of hushed silence as I opened the doors to James' office.  A note proped on the desk with my name on it sat in plain sight.

[i]Rec room.[/i]

He knew my answer.

I walked to the rec room and pushed open the doors.  The room was filled with members of the CCB lining the walls.  My pack followed behind me and James smiled.  "I take it your decision has been made.  I didn't figure you'd come here.  Your loyalties lying with your beloved."

"They can take care of themselves.  I'm responsible for these here."

James nodded.  "I expected nothing less of you."

From behind James Garrett stepped weilding air and earth around him like he was some sort of giant octopus.  I froze at the sight of my demon in the flesh.  He even mimic the imagary bestoying upon himself red eyes of fire.  Illusion.  He had tormented me years upon  years with those images.  I felt fingers slip into mine and the fear vanished.  Isabel looked up at me with fire in her eyes.  She said nothing but she grounded me.  

I made it no pretense as I crafted a fire circle around Garrett and let him watch as it slowly filled in as he tried to fight it off.  I watched as my magic poured into him and his skin light on fire.  The air soon stank of burning hair and flesh and the sounds of his screams were the only thing that could be heard.  Garrett begged James to help him, but James just laughed at him.  "One does not hurt the children of the pack."

I snapped Garrett's neck with a weave of air and he fell to the floor and the fire vanished in a fog of steam and the smell of the earth I'd used to douse it.

James smiled. "Good my boy.  And now?"

I smiled in return but I didn't get a chance to challenge him as Charles stepped in front of James.  "I challenge you to leadership of your pack.  Fight me like wolf not your tricks."

James sighed.  "Charles..."

I interrupted.  "I accept those terms."

Isabel squeezed my hand and I walked to the middle of the room.  It wasn't a fair fight.  But I had my pack at my back.  I was safe in the knowledge the Iasabel would keep them safe with Cari's help.  And Dorian would be safe.  I didn't care if I died.  If I coud die...

There was a ringing of a bell in the distance and Charles launched at me with snouted face and claws for hands.  I could only use what I had at my arsenal.  Which amounted to nothing but my hands.  James frowned when he saw I intended to fight as Charles had asked.  With a nod I saw various weapons slide out on to the floor around us.  One slide to my feet and I picked up the sword.  I recognized it as Ants.  The blade was old and of Japanese descent.  One of the first samari sword ever taken from Japan's soil.  I picked it up and smiled.  Ant and I had sparred with swords once upon a time with this very sword.  I'd run him through the heart by accident.

Charles hadn't given me any time to unsheath the sword but it didn't matter as I rolled out of the way unsheathing the sword as I did, standing in one fluid motion.  I was taught to fight those stronger and faster than I was.  I was handicapped from the beginning.  But I had training and I fell back up on that training and I let the memories of my childhood dance through my veins.

The pack magic amplified my senses.  The sword danced in my hands as we played a game of cat and mouse.  The sound of the battle was the only thing in my ears as I felt Charles' jaws clamp shut on my sword arm and the sword clattered to the ground.  He howled in victory as I fetched another weapon with my left hand.  It was clumbsy and awkward but Charles rushed me head down intending to take me to the ground.  I used both hands and as Charles stepped in front of me like a baseball bat i swung the club and felt his skull shatter as brain matter splattered everywhere.

His momentum carried me backwards and I crashed into the wall behind me gasping for breath.

I could hear the whooping and cheering of my pack around me.  I pulled myself off the wall and back around to where James was standing with a small smile on his face.  Elena was collapsed against Isabel, tears streaming down her face.  When she looked up and saw me watching her she gave me a small smile and a brief nod.  I felt her join the pack.

I turned back around to look at James.  He nodded.  "You have my word.  If you survive the detonation will not happen."  James raised his voice.  "Is that understood!  If I fall you do not press the button anyway."  He looked at me.  "Well?"

"James Wright, I challenge you to the leadership of the Creed of Celestial Beings and everything under it."

He nodded.  "I will not make the same demands as Charles.  Only that it be an honorable fight."

I nodded, "Clear the weapons."

James looked at me with a quizical look.  When all the weapons returned to their owners I made weaves of earth air and fire around my hands and jaws.

James laughed with a nodded.  "I accept."  He shifted his hands into claws and jaws with sharp teeth.

I could feel the stiching of my skin from the wounds Charles had given me and there were small stabs of pain lancing through me as the werewolf venom was fighting against my healing ability.

I moved slowly as James circled me.  Neither one of us wanting to make the first move.  I heard Elena cry out, "Big babies!  Fight already!"

We both chuckled to ourselves as we both stepped into a grapple.  I could feel Jame's claws digging into my arms.  It was a searing sort of pain.  I could feel the blood dripping to the ground as he tossed me to the side sending me crashing into the ground and losing my breath.

He was on top of me before I knew it and the only thing I could do was block the blows that came at my face.  I felt my arms shreading and the blood dripping down on to my face.

The pack rallied with me giving me the strength to push back.  James didn't move much but I used that little bit to send my arm and the makeshift claws into James stomach as hard as I could.  I felt the moment I hit his skin, I could feel the weaves of air slicing into his intestines and the blood flowing from the wounds as I drove my hand through his body.  I grabbed his spine and he crumpled in pain as I pulled my arm free.  He collapsed to the side with part of his spine still in my hand.

There was nothing but silence in the rec room as the magic that bound James to every being under the CCB umbrella fell to me.

## Unexpected Challenge

The magic finished washing over everyone and I was still lying in a pool of blood and covered in brain matter.  My wounds were healing slowly as the werewolf venom still coursed through my veins.  People slowly came to form a circle around me.  Jo and Raf were kneeling beside me trying to help me up.  Isabel stood standing above me with a huge smile on her face.  Elena was leaning against her still greiving her husband, but she was smiling proudly at me.  

There was a ripple in the room as the doors to the rec room crashed open and a voice boomed.  "I challenge the leader of the CCB!"

"Fuck!" I whispered.

"Where is your leader?"

The crowd around me parted like the red sea and I stood there covered in the blood of the former leader and Mark Green stared down at me as every were and memeber of the CCB bowed at my feet.  There was a crowd behind Mark Green. I saw the council and others who knew me, who had heard of my death.  My father fell to his knees I heard many gasps as Mark frowned.  "Nox?"

"In the flesh.  You didn't think to see what was going on before challenging did you?"

Mark started to stammer.  "I can... I didn't.  I will retract it."

"I'm sorry.  By the Clandestine Providence all challenges must be met once issued."  I sighed, "I accept.  What rules would you like to issue, I offer the challenger compensation."

"I'm not some weakling because of my age.  To the death."  Mark complained.

I sighed.  "As you have it." I limped my way to the center of the room and I saw Dorian staring at me and I saw the fear in his eyes.  I gave him a small smile before turning my attention to the much older man.

I raised my hand and a bell signalled the beginning of the fight.  Mark Green took up a fighting stance and I stood there weilding nothing but the air around me.  The venom in my veins was fighting me.  I fell to a knee and there was a gasp throughout the crowd.  

I looked at Isabel and she only nodded.  Mark took my distraction as signal to attack and as he let loose a series of punches that I mechanically dropped to the floor to avoid. I wove a single thread of air then wrapped it around his neck and yanked.  The pop of his spine echoed in the room as he fell to the floor.

I lay on the ground gasping for air that was struggling to reach my lungs.  Isabel was kneeling at my side at the same instant Dorian was there.  They looked across me at each other and Isabel smiled.  "You must be Dorian Vega.  I've heard so much about you."

"You have?" Dorian asked but his eyes had gone to me as he wove all four elements at the same time.   My eyes widened in surprise and he smiled down at me, "I've been practicing."

I whispered, "I love you. Both."

Dorian looked over at Isabel with a wry smiled.  "You've made an impression."  I couldn't hear anything else they said as my body arched in pain and I fought to keep the scream from leaving my lips as my body expelled the venom through my pours leaving me weak but clean.

As my senses came back to me I heard Elena herding people away from the rec room.  "He needs to sleep.  Four fights is too much for anyone.  Challenges can come tomorrow."

Dorian sounded shocked, "Four."

Isabel smiled.  "Garrett Spencer stood before James and Nox burnt him alive but not after he begged James for help and James refused him.  Charles' changlleged Nox to the right for his pack.  It was a mechanical fight, Charles wanted a fair fight which wasn't fair until James issued weapons Nox could use.  Then Nox challenged James and it was an honorable fight.  You know the rest."

There was a distrubance beyond Elena as some people were trying to get past the ring of body guards that stood between her and me.  I sat up with the help of Dorian and Isabel and saw Anabel Dowager, my father and Margo among a few others trying to get past Elena.  "It's alright Elena, they can come close, I don't expect them to challenge me.  They might damage me but they won't challenge me."

Elena gave me a wry smile and nodded, letting the small gaggle of my Venatori friends through the ring.  Anabel was holding a small bundle in her arms and was hovering over Dorian whispereing in his ear.  He frowned then nodded.  "Anabel wants to know if you want to meet your daughter Dakota."

I looked up at her and she smiled.  "I'd love to but I'm covered in things I'd rather she not see me in."

Anabel nodded, "Later then.  Dorian never turly beleive you'd died.  He had dreams about you."

I smiled.  "Ant didn't do a very good job then."

I heard a laugh echo from the shadows at the mention of his name.  "I did perfectly well my friend.  Remember your promise."

"I will come when I'm called Ant, I gave my word I will keep my promise as long as your mother does."

"Until the day she dies."

"Until the day I die."  I echoed.

"You made a deal with the vampires?"  My father stared down at me.  I  held up my hand and Isabel helped me up despite the other men around me.  She snaked an arm around my waist and helped me stand as my wounds were still healing.

"I did.  And the Venatori will stop hunting Bernstein and his followers.  Any act against the vampires is an act against me."

My father scoffed at me, "Who do you think you are issuing me orders.  The council is my commander."

I smiled.  "My dear, dear father, by the Clandestine Providence I am the leader of the Venatori.  I outrank you and every other council member in the Venatori by right and acheivement, unless someone wishes to challenge the law or me you will listen to me."

He stood there in stunned silence his mouth open.  I gave him a level look.  "In my exile I've learned alot about the Clandestine Providence.  And I will make changes."

I raised my voice so those around the ring of guards can hear me.  "Remove the bombs from the AU building and get rid of them and any other plans against the Venatori.  Same goes for you, anymove agains the Venatori is a move against me."

The members of the CCB all nodded a head and stepped sideways around the remaining Venatori.  "I want to go home."  I looked at Isabel.  She smiled and looked to Dorian and Anabel. "Dorian, Anabel, will you join us?"

Dorian looked to Anabel and she nodded, but Dorian answered with a smiled, "Our pleasure."## Epilogue

I grabbed a shower the moment I got home to the pack house.  The house was packed when I stepped into the gathering areas of the house.  Elena was the first to spot me and waved me over.  I wrapped my arms around her and gave her a hug and whispered in her ear, "I'm sorry about Charles."

She gave me a weak smile.  "He was a proud man, he died well."

"I just wish he hadn't needed to die."  

She kissed my cheek and smiled, "It was foretold Nox - from the ashes he will rise."

"I'm not prophecy fullfillment.  I'm just mean.  His death was needless.  It served no purpose.  He was not pack leader, nor leader of anything."

Elena smiled, "And Garrett's death, was it needless?  He did the same as Charles stood up for what he beleived in."

I frowned.  "It was needless.  I hate to say it, but it did nothing more than satisfy my revenge.  It changes nothing.  My childhood still scars me internally if not externally and my dreams will still haunt me even if I no longer fear being hurt from them."  I sighed, "Only one death truly was needed to save the people I love.  James died honorably."

"But with the Imperataors death you can affect real change.  While it was a needless death, it has the greatest avenue for change."  Elena smiled.  "You have so much to do now.  I don't even know where to begin to help you."

"Right now, we all relax and have a good time.  We have a lot to celebrate.  Tomorrow we can start rebuilding."

I felt an arm snake across my waist and Isabel curled under my arm and leaned against my chest.  "You have a few people who would like to meet you Nox."

I kissed Elena on the cheek. "Duckling, I will speak with you tomorrow then.  Enjoy your evening.  If you need comforting, you are welcome to spend the night with us."

Elena nodded and patted my hand as Isabel lead me off.  Isabel grinned.  "I think your bed will be rather full tonight.  Celebration and grief."

I nodded.  "It's good thing we have a big bed then.  Where are we going?

"In here." Isabel opened the office door where Dorian and Anabel stood watching and two clean little boys hold a baby girl.  Dorian looked up and smiled at me.  

He knelt down and asked, "Can I borrow Dakota for a minute she needs to meet someone very special to us."

The boys nodded and Dorian lifted the child from their hands and carried her towards me carefully.  He placed her in my arms and introduced us.  "Nox I'd like you to meet our daughter, Dakota.  And I mean our in so many different ways."

I smiled down at the little girl with the darkest eyes I'd ever seen.  "She's beautiful."

I rocked her and cooed at her for a few minutes lost in the moment that this could have been my life.  I handed her back to Dorian.  "Take care of her."

"We will.  I think the four of us need to talk."  Dorian said.

I nodded.  "First things first."  I walked over to the boys sitting in my office chair and were now spinning around in circle.  I have them a quick push and then caught them as they whirled past me a second time.  "I'm Nox.  Can I ask you your names now?"

"Chance," said the bigger boy, "This is my brother Victor."

"Chance and Victor.  This is Isabel, and Anabel.  And that's Dorian."  I pointed to them in turn.  "We are all going to make sure you are taken care of okay?"

They nodded. "Good.  I want you to make yourself at home here, this is your house now too.  So I want you to go out there and I want you to find Ms. Elena and Ms. Emily and I want you to help them make our guests comfortable.  We have a lot of them.  Celia can help you too."

They got up from the chair tipping over from the spinning and then gigled. Victor hugged me tightly.  "You are so colorful."

I frowned.  "I'm sorry."

He laughed, "It's so pretty."

"Thank you."

I stood up and watched the boys leave.  I looked up and saw Dorian looking at me with questions.  I smiled at him.  "He sees Auras."

Dorian nodded.  "We'll have to help him understand, we've seen too many humans go crazy with that."

Isabel wrapped an arm around me and around Dorian.  "Their family was killed by werewolves."

I looked at Anabel and saw the expression on her face and smiled softly at her.  I held out my hand to her.  "You are Dorian's wife?"  She nodded.  "Isabel is mine."

Dorian looked at me with shock and then a frown.  "I..."

Isabel laughed, "He didn't move on Dorian.  His love for you is the reason we are married.  He couldn't save you and not protect his pack if he failed."

"Marriages of necessity."  Anabel said.

I shook my head.  "No, Anabel.  Marriages born of necessity out of love.  This doesn't have to be messy. I love Dorian.  I love Izzy.  I am not beyond the idea that we can't figure out someway to make this foursome work."

Anabel sighed, "My marriage is loveless, Nox.  Why would I want it to work?"

"Because of your children."

"They aren't Dorian's, you know this."

I smiled. "But all the paperwork say they are.  They are created to maintain the idea that Dorian kept his obligations.  You would leave your children because Dorian doesn't love you the way you want him to?  What if we loved you?"

"We?"

"All of us.  Sex is only part of a relationship Anabel.  Dorian is capable of loving you, and I'm sure he does.  He loves Stella.  Just not in the way either of you want.  Family is not made up of blood, or magic but bonds we choose to forge that tie us together stronger than that.  Not because someone tells us we have to, but because we want to."

I looked at each of them. "Help me recreate the Providence that should exist not the one that does exist."  

Isabel nodded.  "You know I'm in."

Dorian nodded his ascent.  We all looked to Anabel.

"Why do you want me?  I bring nothing to the table."

I smiled, "You are the mother of an Ascendant - the first of her kind."

Anabel nodded and I smiled at her, "And then we begin."
