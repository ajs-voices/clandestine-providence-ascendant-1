## Frame Up

Ant was the classi tall, dark and handsome.  His build was that of a weight lifter and his t-shirt didn't quite fit under the leather jacket he wore.  Dorian whispered, "He's cute."

I laughed, "You know he can hear you right?"

Dorian blushed slightly.  "No I didn't."

Ant offered his hand to Dorian.  "Antony Giovanni.  I didn't exptect Nox to bring his ... boyfriend?"

I smiled.  "We were spending the day together, didn't want to end it because you called.  This is Dorian Vega."

"Ah.  The name I know."

"You've heard of me?"  Dorian asked.

"Nox likes to talk.  A lot."  Ant smiled.  "But I'm sure you know that."

Dorian nodded knowingly.  I asked.  "What's the emergency?  I didn't even know you knew I was back."

Ant started walking from his leaning position down the subway platfrom to the employee's only.  I threw up a veil so we'd not get as many eyes, but the place was rather empty as it was.  

Dorian looked behind us and frowned.  "This isn't illegal is it?"

Ant shook his head.  "No, but the person I need Nox to talk to isn't a fan of the daylight even underground."

"And you aren't?"  Dorian asked.

"He's an old vampire and a daywalker."  I smiled.  "Though newly aquired, if the rumors are true.  Your mother must be freaking out."

Ant shrugged, "Cari is learning much slower than I am.  She's a creature of the darkness.  And Ry is helping the best he can.  But how do you teach a vampire that the light doesn't hurt you anymore when it has for centuries."

"I guess the same way you tell someone they are immortal."

Dorian choked on that.  "Yeah let's poison you so you don't die."

I squeezed Dorian's fingers in mine.  "We'll deal with that later.  Vampire emergencies - Il Cane in town.  This takes priority over my stupid life."

"Nox.." Dorian cut off as he saw a man standing in the darkness, his skin white as chalk with glowing red eyes.  It was a trick of sorts.  

I rolled my eyes.  "Marco, stop.  You aren't a demon and I'll sliced your head off if you try it again.  I won't share anything anymore if you keep it up."

He pouted.  "Dorian.  Marco.  Marco my boyfriend, Dorian, you tease him in the slightest I'll have your head too."

His pout grew deeper and Ant smacked him up side the head.  "Act your age."

From the echos of the shadows a voice echoed in the tunnel.  "Boys all of you behave."

I knew that voice. "Bernstein.  Why have you called me here with these two numbskulls?"

Dorian's jaw dropped.  "You know the Bernstein vampire.  Our fathers..."

Bernstein stepped out in a long trenchcoat that fell nearly to his ankles, his hair was dark and pulled back at the nape of his neck.  I knew it ran to well past his waist.  "Your father's are the reason I call upon you, Venatori."

"You know my name." I said flatly.

He stepped out his dark brown eyes were nearly black in the dim light.  "Because I requested you and you came I will oblige.  Nox.  Your father is hunting me and mine."

I looked at Dorian and he nodded.  "My father and Kai have been hunting down a kiss of vampires that have been raising hell in the college frats and some of the local clubs.  All evidence points to the Bernstein vampire."

"But you aren't doing it are you?  You want me to stop my father."  I said.

"Not stop.  Talk to him.  Or let me speak to him in a safe place."

"What makes you think I have any weight with  my father?"  I asked.

"You do.  You are his son.  As Figilio Del Cane can persuade his mother to stay her hand."

I asked.  "The council thinks you are guilty too?"

Marco nodded. "They don't beleive it, but it is their policy to take care of their own before the Venatori get there.  Your father is close to finding our home.  We don't wish to move."

"Fine I'll see what I can do.  But I can't promise anything.  I would offer to bring you in and see a trial but we know how that goes."

Everyone nodded including Dorian.  Bernstein looked at Dorian for the first time.  "Why did you bring another with you?"

"We were on a date.  You interupted it."

He looked at me with curiousity.  "You are not the dating type.  Or the boys would have fled long ago."

I laughed.  "I've changed."

Dorian asked, "Both of them?"

I sighed and nodded. "Yes.  Never at the same moment in time.  I met Marco when I was young, he likes to play let's hurt the humans and I stepped in and offered myself instead."

Marco frowned.  "He's not quite as fun as I'd had hoped."

"Meaning?" Dorian asked.

"He was not quite filling his skin as he does these days.  Afraid and easily manipulated.  He's a better man now.  But not because of me.  Or Ant."

"Don't speak for me Marco."  Ant glared at him.

"Enough!" Bernstein shouted.  "I tire of your bedroom games.  Leave me."

Marco took Dorian my the arm and shifted him away from us while Bernstein left the area.  Ant shook his head.  "Do what you can, brother, and we'll do what we can.  He's an old cracky vampire but he's and his aren't behind the murders.  There is some other plot to separate the pacts of the Clandestine Providence.  Venatori hunting vampire will never end well.  Il Cane will not like it."

"I know.  but I better resuce Dorian from Marco.  I'll let you know what I can do."  Ant nodded and slipped into the shadows and disappeared.  I hated when he did that but I hated traveling that way even worse.

"Marco leave Dorian alone."

Dorian smiled.  "He was being a perfect gentleman though his tales are a little over the top."

"I'd say he was lying but he probably wasn't."  Marco grinned at me then stepped into the shadows himself and was gone.

"That's a neat trick."  Dorian said in awe.

"It's a gut wrenching experience."  I took Dorian's hand in mine.  "What did he tell you"

"Marco was regailing a tale of your first encounter.  An eleven year old boy standing up for a 20 something girl who was renigging on a deal."

"Did he tell you what he did to me?"

Dorian nodded.  "He did.  And he suggested I try it."

I shuddered and not in a good way.  "I trust you."

Dorian stopped  and took my hands in his.  "But it was number one on your list of rules."

I smiled at Dorian and nodded.  "I'm aware of that.  I trust you with everything, even my fears Dorian.  I don't suggest it be something we try soon, but yes I'd be willing."

I could see a certain spark in Dorian that hadn't been there before.  I knew he liked to play rough, I guess I didn't think he enjoyed it that much.
