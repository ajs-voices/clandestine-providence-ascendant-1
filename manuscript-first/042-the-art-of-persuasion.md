## The Art of Persuasion

Dorian kissed me rather throughly without touching me anywhere else, it was like he didn't want to tempt himself.  I had a sudden surge of butterflies.  I never got butterflies when I was with someone.  Dorian must have sensed something and pulled away and rested his forehead against mine and pulled me close to him and whispered.  "You are much to nice sometimes, Nox.  I won't take advantage of you like that."

I brushed my lips against his softly as I whispered.  "You aren't taking advantage of me if I want you to."  I took his bottom lip between mine and bit softly and Dorian gave a small moan of pleasure.  "And I want you to."

I pulled away before we could fall farther down that rabbit hole.  "I need to talk to my father."  I grabbed Dorian around the waist and started walking back towards the exit.  "I'll walk you home."

Dorian smiled.  "I'm going with you.  You can't get rid of me now."

I nodded.  "It's boring."

Dorian laughed, "Nothing is boring with you."

I kissed him on the cheek as we walked out of the subway platform and head home.  My father hopefully would be easy to find.  If not we'd be looking around for a while.

Dorian held my hand against his hip as we walked back to the AU building.  There was a companionable silence but I knew Dorian had to be thinking about his latest revelation about me.  I had to know.  I asked, "Penny for your thoughts?"

I saw Dorian look at me with a grin.  "Just thinking about how I don't really know you.  And yet I feel that I do."

"Oh really?"  I smiled back at him.

"Your life before this moment was full of ..."  

He paused searching for a word - politically correct or something that I wouldn't take offense to so I offered a few suggestions, "sex? self-harm? abuse? diaster?"  I grinned at him.  "They made me who I am today.  I regret none of it.  Well maybe one thing."

Dorian stopped and turned me towards him.  "What do you regret Nox?"

I smiled at him. "Not saying anything to you about how I felt when I had the chance."

Dorian laughed.  "I wouldn't have been receptive then.  You had kissed Dylan.  You were flamboyout and excessively gay."

I started walking again as the light had changed.  "None of that has changed."

Dorian nodded.  "But I have.  Where before Dylan's opinion matter it does not now.  You being flamboyout is only a mask.  Same with the obession to look and act like an 80s sitcom feature the topic of the month, My son is gay."

I laughed at Dorian's assessment.  Not because it was funny but because he had hit the nail on the head.  Dorian continued, "None of that matters anymore.  You are a bright and intelligent young man who sees the world in a new light.  You were raised as one of us, you are one of us, but your reality was so different from ours you saw outside the box."

I shrugged.  "Such is life.  I'm glad I'm not a stain on your image."

Dorign grinned, "Now I never said that."  He pulled me into an alley way and pushed me up against the wall and kissed me furiously.  We parted breathless and I was weak in the knees.  "I love that you are the way you are.  I don't have to hold back."

I grinned at him and he took me by the hand and started walking again.  Dorian smiling happily as we entered the AU building still holding hands.  We held hands as we searched the building for my father which wasn't all that difficult, he was having dinner with Emilio at Dorian's parents apartment.

Dolores answered the door and I could hear my father laughing at something Emilio had said.  We were at the right place.  "Dorian!  I wasn't expecting you."  She was smiling with both her lips and her eyes and Dorian hugged his mother.  

I interrupted their family moment.  "I need to speak to Kai."

"Nox!"  She hugged me as well which I stiffened the moment she wrapped her arms around my back.

Dorian took my hand and pulled me past his mother whispering to her, "He's not a big hugger."

Which wasn't exactly a lie, touching like that was foreign and certainly not something I was used to, but Dorian had saved me as polietly as possible.  

"Father.  Kai."  Dorian smiled as he headed for the wine cabinet in the kitchen.  

"I need to talk to you off the record."  I told my father and Emilio.

Kai looked up at me with his deep brown eyes and frowned.  "About what?"

"Your vampire case."

Dorian handed me a glass of wine and I sipped.  Emilio nodded.  "Sit.  Relax."

I sighed.  "I have reason to beleive that you are closing in on the wrong vampires."

Kai asked, "Reason to beleive?  Some prophetic vision I don't know about?"

I shook my head.  "No.  Word from the source itself.  Bernstein contacted me..."

Kai's anger light up around him, fire coalesced into patterns outside of his body and I knew he could ignite things if he just thought it, but he was a trained fire-starter he could control it.  Just as I had been one, my father was one before me.  "You know the Bernstein vampire?"

I nodded.  "I know alot of vampires and were's.  They live in this city too you know."

Kai's anger only grew at my comment.  "And you let him live?"

I sighed.  "He didn't kill those people.  Nor did any of his kiss.  They are old, Kai.  They aren't going to screw up like that.  Marco and Bernstein rule with an iron fist and Desmond is the only one who is higher than they in this City."

"Marco?  Desmond?"  Emilio asked his hand on my father's shoulder calming him down, or at least keeping him from ripping me apart.

"Desmond is the council member who makes his home here.  He is one of three in the new world.  This is all vampire lore, things you should know.  And Marco is like a moth to flame, he seeks out individuals to work with behind the scenes.  He's been party to many kings and queens ascentions as well as their down falls.  Again vampire lore."

It was Dorian who asked, "And you know Desmond."

I nodded.  "I've met him once.  Ant introduced us when I was hunting a vampire here who tried to make it a safe haven under Desmond's eyes.  Desmond gave me his head as proof he was dead."

"And let me guess by Ant you mean the son of Il Cane - Antony Giovanni Jr?"

I nodded. "Yes."

Everyone in the room was blinking at me.  "And they still live?"

I shrugged.  "They've done nothing wrong.  No need to kill them or bring them in.  No different from you or I."

Kai got up and paced back and forth.  "You expect me to beleive a vampire over the evidence."

"No.  I expect you to do your job and find the responsible party.  Bernstein has agree to meet with you in a safe neutral location to discuss the problem."

Emilio nodded.  "We will meet with him.  Make the arrangements."

Kai was about to say something when Emilio glared at him and my father backed down.  He actually backed down and I was impressed at the way Emilio took charge of my father - a man I knew never let anyone tell him what to do.

I nodded.  Dolores poked her head into the living room from the kitchen.  "Dorian, you and Nox will stay for dinner?"

Dorian looked at me and nodded.  He smiled back.  "Yes, Mother.  We will stay for dinner.  So long..."

Dorlores was already out of the kitching grabbing my hand, "Then come Nox, you can help me."

I looked back at Dorian as his mother dragged me into the kitchen, he smiled and shrugged.  I had no other choice.  "Yes, ma'am."
