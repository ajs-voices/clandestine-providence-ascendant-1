## That Night and the Next Morning

I pulled Dorian closer to me and  smiled up at him, "But I want to forget that for now."

I took the glass from Dorian's hand and set it on the floor and lifted Dorian to the couch and I laid on top of him.  I kissed him had and one of his hands found the back of my neck and the other clutched at my shirt.  

Our bodies were hard against one another, I could taste the wine on his lips.  The feel of his teeth and tongue against my neck made me shake.  I wanted nothing more than to feel his body against mine.  Dorian bit my neck softly before he whispered against it, his breath sending shivers up my spine.  "We aren't teenagers."  He sat up manuerving me into his lap easily.  "The bed has far more room and way more comfortable."

I stood up and he followed me up but I followed him to his room.  Dorian took his phone from his pocket and turned it off.  He took mine form me and did the same setting them both on the night stand.  He whispered, "No interruptions this time."

My body ached for him.  He stood before me a dark light in his eyes and pulled my t-shirt over my head and undid his own buttons as I reached inside and pushed it off of him.  We kissed and touched and explored each other's bodies long before we were lying on the bed, Dorian on top of me and I could want nothing more than him.  

Our bodies were tangled around each other and with the blankets below. Before the night was over we were both panting and sweating in the glow of estasy.  I drifted into nothingness naked lying half on top of Dorian.  My fingers entwined in his at my back and the other tracing the edge of the tattoo that ran the complete half of his body.

I woke to the sun streaming through the window still curled up naked next to Dorian.  There was a small pool of drool on Dorian's chest.  Not embarassing at all.  Though it wouldn't have been the first of it on his body, and not likely the last.  I unfurled slowly from him feeling refreshed but his arm tightened around my body.  I nipped at his neck then whispered, "I'm not going anywhere.  I promise.  Bathroom."

He let me go and rolled over and curled against an extra pillow.  I stared at the long line of his body for far too long before I went into the bathroom to take a shower.  His bathroom smelled of him and I was soon lost in the soft scent of Dorian when the bathroom door opened and Dorian stepped in wearing just his birthday suit.  My body stiffened and my mouth went dry.  I bit my bottom lip.  "Care to join me?"

Dorian didn't answer my question before he had me in the shower pressed up against the cold tile and I could feel him against me.  The warm water rained down on our hot bodies and it felt cold.  I could only feel the press of Dorian against me.  His body moving with mine.  For all the flirting we'd done earlier, for every kiss and every nerve ending he'd awakened the night before, Dorian was finding new ways to make my mind and body soar with delight.  

We eventually got clean, and dressed, though I still had no idea the time.  I made breakfast in Dorian's kitchen.  I'd brought fixings the night before but I hadn't stayed the night.  I used it now since it was still there.

Dorian watched me as he padded around his living room in jeans and a t-shirt.  I watched him move through picking things up that had been scattered the night before.  I spoke loud enough so he could hear me.  "I like this outfit."

Dorian looked up at me from across the room.  "I figured you might.  It is a weekend, I don't always wear a suit and tie."

"You could have fooled me.  So if it's a weekend, what do you plan on doing?"

Dorian grinned.  "Spend the day with you.  If that's alright."

"What if I want to spend the day with you?"

Dorian chuckled.  "I think I could be persuaded to allow that."

Breakfast consisted of a tomato and spinach fritatta and mimosas - Dorian's addition to the meal.  I siped at the sparkling drink but didn't finish it.  Dorian downed mine when we were cleaning up.  "You don't drink much do you?"  He asked.

I shook my head.  "A beer or two at most.  I'm not a big fan of lost control."

He smiled.  "Neither am I but it's relaxing."

"Not for me.  I get anxious I'll do something stupid."

Dorian laughed.  "Nox Sétanta doing something stupid, that's not something I've ever seen."  He kissed me softly and took my hand and headed for the door.  "Let's go for a walk."

"Alright.  But I need my phone."  

Dorian frowned slightly before he pulled it from his pocket.  "If you inisit."

I turned it on and checked the time and my schedule and moved things around as Dorian pulled on socks and shoes.  I was enjoying the sight of him bent over when he stood up and I handed him my phone with it off as he'd handed it to me.  "I am free now and I can spend all day with you without worry and anxiety."

Dorian took my phone from my hand his fingers brushing the back of my hand.  "I don't need this."

I smiled.  "I want you to keep it for the day.  You temper my anxiety, you might as well keep me from following up on the things that I can easily deal with tomorrow."

I sighed, "Though there is a matter of information I need to get."

"What do you need?"

"His schedule for the next two weeks and I need it to have it to Garrett in two days." 

Dorian nodded.  "One second.  "

I caught Dorian's arm as he went to pick up his phone.  "Please don't jeopardize your reputation for me.  I can get it.  It's not hard.  Can we go to the archives for a little bit.  We can visit your mother and I can borrow a computer."

Dorian put his phone back in his pocket.  "Yes.  I'd like her to meet you."

I smiled and we walked out of his apartment hand in hand.

The Archives were just as I remembered them - large and full of dust covered books that smelled of old paper.  The computers were off to the side and I kissed Dorian on the cheek and went to use one while he went to the large ciruclar desk to greet an older feminie version of himself with bright green eyes.

It wasn't much to log in to a computer and look up Mark Green's schedule.  I had access to it, every hunter could.  Garrett could but he was not part of the ruling family.  It had it's perks at times and that's why he wanted it.  I didn't hide my tracks as I acessed the right information and wrote down his schedule on a scrap of paper.  Downloading would lead to me.  Not taht looking it up wouldn't but at least it was more to the point that I was just glancing at it.

I wished for Dorian's memory but I didn't want to involve him in it.  But he already knew anyway not that it mattered.  I don't know why Garrett wanted the information but I was afraid of him enough I didn't need to have Dorian in harms way.

I got up and found Dorian still talking with his mother.  I joined them with a smile.  I offered her my hand.  "Nox Sétanta."

"This is my mother, Dolores Vega."  Dorian in toned.   She took my hand and I brought it to my lips and kissed it gently.  

"A pleasure."

She smiled with her bright green eyes at me.  "You never said he was a charmer."

"He's not so much a charmer, Mother as one who likes to flirt with everyone."  Dorian's voice filled with amusement.

I grinned at Dorian and wrapped my arm around his waist.  "I only have eyes for your son, Mrs. Vega.  Though if you were a few years younger..."

She blushed and Dorian kissed my cheek.  "He would rival you in the kitchen, Mother."

"Oh really?  He will have to come by and cook for the family."

Dorian nodded.  "When he's ready to meet the rest of the family perhaps."  He turned to me, "Did you get what you wanted?"

I nodded.  "Yep."  I turned to his mother with a bright smile.  "It's a pleasure, and I'd love to cook for your family oneday - soon."

"Sounds wonderful."

"I will see you at dinner tomorrow night Mother."  Dorian wrapped his arm under mine and headed towards the exit.  "What shall we do?"
