## Gaining Traction

James asked me to come with him and so I followed.  No one looked concerned.  I shouldn't have been, but I felt something - maybe it was nerves.  This was the guy everyone I currently knew listened to.  

He walked into the locker room and snapped his fingers and everyone left, except for us.  James did wait for the last straggler in the shower to vacate before he sat down on a bench and started untying his shoes.  "Garrett tells me you are dead.  And yet here you stand."

He looked at me with a knowing grin, "Tell me how the Venatori think one of their former hunters is dead and he is not?"

"I stepped between my father and a vampire meeting.  He'd come packing more than the agreement had stated, and the vampires knew of the betrayal before hand. So they were ready to start a war.  My father didn't like it so he tried to kill me.  He bombarded my shield of air with fireballs until he broke it and one landed.  I went up in flames.  I woke up in the pack bedroom with Raf and Jo curled around me."

"And your boyfriend sitting in the corner."  James added.

I nodded.  "The son of Il Cane gave him the remainder of the night with me before he would remove the memory of my survival.  It's better if the Venatori think I'm dead."

I could see that none of this was news to the leader of the CCB.  "And you are okay with never seeing your lover again?"

I shrugged, "No, but it is what it is.  It's not like I've seen him since I was exiled anyway."

"Very true.  You've left most of your old life behind.  Except those connections that you have used to help us."  James smiled.  "What should I tell Garrett then?"

"I'm sure he's figured out I'm not dead.  My death should remain standing.  Otherwise he'll be outed as having a connection to me.  And I don't think he wants that getting out."

James nodded.  "I will remind him of his place then.  Elena tells me you accuse him of childhood trauma."

"Nothing I can prove, and with the scars gone, that proof is even slimmer."

"But you still claim it."

"I know what I know."  I said softly.  "He manipulated me to break my control issues.  He used the one thing I feared most - being hurt, to make me spark, and when I did he'd punish me by my own hand, teaching me control as he did.  He succeeded in helping me control my ability.  But he still abused me in the process."

"And what would you have me do?"  James ask with his hand on his chin as if he were thinking of something to do to him - or to me.

"Nothing, honestly.  I'm over it.  I fear him.  But I'm no longer Venatori if he tries to harm me while I'm out here, he'll pay for it.  I'll kill him just the same and take the consequences of my actions as an Exuli."

"You could have killed him while you were Venatori why didn't you?"

I shrugged.  "I told you.  I was afraid of him.  I freeze every time he's around.  I'm not proud of my paralyzing fear, but one day I will conquer it and he will see the man he created in action."

James smiled.  "I will endeavor to keep him from you until that time.  We do not allow the abuse of our children, but it is your word against his, I'm glad you decided not to take action."

I shrugged.

"Why did you help the little wolf girl back in the Infirmary?"

"Because I could.  I was the only one capable of making sure she didn't hurt herself or me in the process.  The nurses would have tried to restrain her, but when she turned she'd have been freed.  Then they'd have tried to capture her and then they'd either scare her into biting or scratching them, or worse killing them.  And I didn't think Jo could handle that anymore than they could.  So I intervened."

"Even though she could have killed you?"

I smiled.  "I wasn't worried about myself honestly.  I've fought bears and wolves who were bigger and stronger than she is.  I had a wall of air between us for a good share of my advance towards her until I was sure she wasn't going to hurt me.  I'm not an idiot."

"You use your Magnus ability with ease.  More so than any other I've ever know.  It is what Elena brought to my attention first when you were on the stage in central park.  She said you flowed like none other.  Why is this?"

"Because I'm mostly human.  I don't have the speed nor the strength of a Venatori so in order to keep up I used all my other advantages to my best ability.  To most Venatori their mental ability and their Magnus ability is only icing on the cake, to me it it's my bread and butter."

James laughed.  "Why did you help Rafael when Paul didn't want your help?"

"He wanted my help.  He didn't want my vampire friends help."

"What use did you need the vampire for?"  He asked with his head to the side.

"I needed Ant to take me to the location quickly.  I arrived before they did because of Ant's ability to travel through the shadows.  I knew that the longer Raf was not contained that he would become a higher threat and the Venatori would come for him.  I got there, contained him and had him under control by the time everyone arrived and no one got hurt."

"Very smart.  How did you become an Alpha without the change? Not only did you control and console one, but two fledgling werewolves but you took one from another Alpha."

"I didn't know I had done that - taken him from someone else."

"Paul said he told you."  James sounded confused.

"No, Paul said to me that his Alpha should have done it."

James nodded.  "He is correct.  Paul was his Alpha.  He should have been there, should have taken control of the rogue wolf.  But you were already there, he was already calm.  Who did you do it?"

I shrugged.  "I don't know - honestly."

James smiled.  "Would you like to hear my theory?"

"Sure.  I love theories about my life."  I said dryly.

James chuckled.  "Your mother was attacked by wolves at a young age.  She survived and was taken in by the Venatori and taught to be one because of that.  It is known among our kind that some humans carry the dna of a wolf, but do not change themselves, but pass it on to their offspring.  But you were not wolf either because your Venatori genes kept it dormant."

"And when my immortallity kicked in, so did every other dormant gene in my body."  I said.  It was an intriguing theory. I would have to discuss it with Asher when I saw him  next.

James laughed.  "You don't beleive you had it before then, the abilitiy to be an Alpha?"

I shook my head, "No.  Someone remarked that I smelled like a forest, where I never had before."

James sniffed the air.  "You do, underneath the smokey campfire there is a distinct smell of wolf.  Emily says that it grows when your pack is nearer to you.  Paul is afraid you will take more from him - willingly or not he doesn't care, but it makes him weak in the eyes of some of his pack."

"I could step in and make you give what was rightfully his back, but I'm not a wolf and I dislike getting in the way of Alpha disputes.  How do you suppose we fix this dilemia?"

"I can find another home.  I can't afford much, but I'd leave if it'd make things easier."

James smiled.  "The sacrafice.  You have every right to the house assigned you.  You are more powerful than he is."

"Why do I want to cause problems?"

"Elena said you might be soft when it came to friends and family."  James sounded disapointed.

"I'm not weak.  I choose my battles.  This is not a battle worth fighting."

"Oh young one, but it is.  Paul has thought to challenge you.  He told me today before I informed them that I wanted to meet you.  He said he would challenge you before your power grew too strong and you took what was his.  This is the life of the wolves, and all other supernatural creatures.  Claim what is yours, Nox."

"Tonight, under the full moon I want you to challenge Paul for his pack.  Failure to do so will see your self out the door.  You must learn the ways of the pack or you will fall short in everything the CCB has to offer.  Protect what is yours."

I sighed.  "And this is a fight to the death?"

James nodded.  "Yes, my boy it is.  It must be.  To do otherwise is to show weakness."

"Are we still on for dinner?"

James nodded. "Elena has gone on and on about your cooking.  Will you cook for the clan tonight?  We would all like to watch the challenge and have a fantastic meal."

I could only nod.

James smiled.  "Then 6pm, we shall see what the young Alpha has in store for us.  I look forward to tonight, Nox."
