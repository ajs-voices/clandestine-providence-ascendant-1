## A New Life

Emily walked with me three blocks to an garage that looked like it had better days.  There were several cars parked outside and all of the bays were full.  There was a high priced looking woman yelling at an balding man with thin gray hair and glasses.  He looked like he was tired of listening.  

I smiled as I walked up.  "Hi."  The woman looked at me with my bright smile and turned her anger on me.  "What do you want?"

"Let me see if I can help you."  I took her by the arm and asked, "What seems to be the problem?"

"I need my car." She fumed.

"Which one is your's ma'am?"

She pointed to the Mercedes in one of the bays.  "Alright.  I will check on what the hold up is.  In the mean time, here is $10 for a coffee across the street.  I will get you your information as soon as I can."

She smiled at me the anger seemed to have lifted at least a little as she took the money from my hand.  She turned and walked across the street as I suggested.

"You'll go broke like that young man."  The man she was yelling at said as I walked over to him and Emily.  

"You must be Auto.  I'm sorry I stepped in, but you looked fustrated.  I can't imagine having a high priced woman yelling at me for god knows how long as you have been doing for as long as you've been a live."

He hurmphed, "I don't have your pretty smile."

I grinned at him.  "But you do, sir, you just need to smile more."  I held out my hand, "Nox Setanta, at your service.  If you'll let me know what's up with that Mercedes I can get the woman to calm down and come back later."

"I told her already.  She doesn't want to listen.  We need to order a part it won't be in until tomorrow."

I nodded.  "And what's her problem?"

"She needs her car now. Now, NOW! she said. Her insurance company is covering the rental but she wants her car back."

I grinned.  "Alright, what time should she come back tomorrow?"

"4pm would be good, when I'm not here."  Auto laughed.

"I can arrange that, if all goes as planned her car will be ready?"

"Yes."  He said flatly.

"What part needs to be ordered?"

Auto blushed, "It's a simple gasket, but apparently the last boy I had keeping inventory forgot to check those."

"Simple - no moving parts.  Show me."  I said.

He looked at Emily with a sideways glance and handed me a part that looked like a little donut.  "Is this what it's supposed to look like?"

"Yes and no.  It's not broken.""  He separated the rubber.

I smiled.  "A new one would be better instead of fixing that one right?"

He tossed it in the bin, "there is no fixing that."

I picked it up out of the garbage and took a better look at it.  Everything was simple enough, it was a rubber gasket, of a specific shape and thickness meant to keep hoses from leaking.  I replicated the pattern and wove the pattern into the exiting material and fixed all the rough edges while I was at it.  Then handed it back to Auto.  "Good as new."

I used that knowledge and made one from scratch.  It took a little while longer as Auto was investigating the one I'd already handed him.  When I handed him the new one he looked at me with stunned silence.  "And a brand new one."

"How did you do that?"

I shrugged.  "I'm Cesari.  I can make about anything if you give me enough time to figure it out.  I can't do mechanical parts at least not put together."

Auto yelled.  "Simon, install this gasket and lets get Ms. Smyth out of our hair.  Tack on an extra $30 dollar rush fee."

I chuckled to myself as Auto waved me to follow him.  "He'll do just fine Emily.  Tell Paul thank you and inform Elena she was better than her word.  Boy you come with me."

"Yes sir."  I followed dutifully.  

He introduced me to Simon and Gloria who were his kin.  He didn't say anything more than that.  He introduced me to their receptionist Betty his wife.  I smiled brightly at her as she pinched my ass when I passed her desk.

Auto informed me, "You're first task is to take inventory.  That jackass before you left it a mess.  After that we'll start teaching you parts, the ordering system and computers and all that."

I asked as Auto was heading back into one of the bays, "My hours?"

"Whatever you want to work boy.  We are easy here.  Just leave it with Bet."

I nodded.  "Alright."  I liked the idea of setting my own hours.

I looked at the hours of operation and decided to come in an hour earlier and stay an hour later.  I had no where else to be.  That would give me two 1 hour breaks if I only worked eight hours as Betty instructed me.

She looked at me odd when I handed her a schedule Monday thru Sunday.  "This for this week?" she asked.

"Every week." I said.

"You need to take a break."

I smiled.  "How many days do I have to work?"  

She shook her head.  "5 of the 7. most people like their weekends."

"Do I have to take them in a row?"  I asked.

She shook her head.  "Sunday and Wednesday then."

"You can take off whatever you want and you choose two odd days?"

I smiled.  "Sunday my boyfriend's family has breakfast together so I know he's not working.  And Tuesday night my favorite dance instructor offers open dance floor."

She frowned, "You have a boyfriend?"

"Is that a problem?" I asked.

"No son.  I didn't think a hunk of a man like you would be into men.  Not the way you handled Ms. Smyth."

I grinned at her, "I like women too.  I just happen to love this man very much.  And with my life straightening out maybe he'll make time to see me."

"Why wouldn't he?"

"Ma'am it's a very long story."

"If you call me ma'am again I'll swot your rear like my own children."

"Yes, Betty.  I will not."  I grinned at her.  

"Why are you taking two hour breaks instead of just working normal hours?"

I smiled.  "I like to stay busy.  And if I'm meant to keep inventory clean then I need a few hours of quiet."

Betty nodded and I left her to her work and I went into the parts room and sighed at the mess.  

But this was my new life.  I could get used to it.
