## Pre-Dinner Gitters

I hadn't really thought about it since Drake had asked me to take him to lunch.  Priorities, but now that I was talking about it with Dorian I could feel the pure terror rising up inside.  I whispered, "He told me not to bring you."

Dorian sighed, "Nox you don't have to go."

I nodded, "I do.  If I don't there could be consequences.  People like Aidan could get hurt Dorian.  I have to go."

"He scares you Nox.  He won't hurt anyone."

"And if he does?"  I stood staring into Dorian's deep blue eyes.  "How could I face you if he hurt your family?  Your son?  His mom?"  I could feel the tears slidin down my cheek.  Dorian reached up and wiped it away.  "I can't have that on my head Dorian."

He nodded and pulled me close and wrapped his arms around me tight.  "What time is dinner?"

"Six."  I whispered.

Dorian nodded, "If you aren't at my apartment by 8 I will come looking for you."

I looked at Dorian and smiled.  "Okay."  I pulled away, "I need to eat again."

Dorian laughed.  "I have to get to work.  I will see you tonight?"

I nodded.  "Yes.  Though I don't know how I'll be."

"I understand."  He kissed me softly and we headed out the gym door.   I followed him to the elevator and while we waited for it to go in the correct direction Dorian held me against him.  "Look at me." 

I hadn't realized I was staring off into space.  I could feel the terror coursing through my veins and Dorian flinched when I turned my eyes to him.  "Why don't you come up to my office with me.  I'll order you something to eat and you can stay there and work."

I nodded unable to speak.  I really couldn't think about work. But I felt better with Dorian so I went with him in the elevator.  He held my hand as I stood stiff as a board staring at the doors.  One fear on top of the other wasn't helping.

We got off the elevator and I followed behind Dorian in a daze.  He opened the door to his office and I sat down in a chair that I'd probably sat in a million times when it was someone else's office.  Dorian sat down in his chair and picked up his phone and I assume he ordered food.  I didn't hear much about the conversation because I could only hear the pulse in my ears.  Dorian came around the desk and sat down in the chair next to me.  "You alright?"

"Yeah."  I lied.  "I'll be okay."

Dorian laughed softly and ran his fingers through the multi colored strands on y head.  "No gel today?"

I smiled.  "I wasn't going to impress kids with spikey hair."

"I like this better."  Dorian ran his fingers through my hair again laying it to the side. 

"You just like running your fingers through my hair."  I smiled at him, "And I must admit that I like when you do."  I relaxed into his touch.  "I like everything about you and how you make me feel."

Dorian grinned at me and stood up.  "You up to a little work?"

I nodded.  "What you need?"

"Help me devise a plan to teach our testers how to read patterns like you do."  

And that's what we did until the food arrived.  Dorian had ordered chineese.  "I hope you can find something here to eat."

I smiled.  "Thank you Dorian.  I'll eat whatever is here."

"You need to tell what's acceptable and what's not."  He said.

I nodded as I opened the take out box and used chop sticks to eat the noodles and vegetables in the box.  "Less carbs, more protien and vegetables.  Always a good formula."

Dorian chuckled.  "Says the guy eating lo mein."

I grinned at him.  We continued to work out a plan to teach adults new ways of thinking without making them feel like a child.

We worked and ate and I was satisfactorily distracted until my phone beeped at me.  I pulled it out without a second thought and saw the text was from Garrett.  I dropped my phone and it bounced under Dorian's chair.  He bent and picked it up and saw the text and frowned.  "He wants you to bring a bottle of wine."

I nodded.  

Dorian sent a reply and handed me my phone. He picked up the phone on his desk and hit one button.  I didn't hear who picked it up.  But I heard Dorians side of the converation.  "Silas.  I need you have a chilled Merlot sent to Garrett Spencer's place at 6:45 tonight.   Make sure Nox SÃ©tanta's name is on it."

He hung up the phone.  I said, "You didn't have to do that."

He smiled at me.  "Yes I did Nox.  You have no taste for wine and Garrett Spencer does.  And besides it's something I can do to help you in this trying moment."

I nodded.  I glanced at the time of the text and frowned.  "I should go get dressed."

Dorian frowned at me.  I continued "I need a shower.  You can join me..."

Dorian chuckled.  "What I wouldn't give, love.  But not before you go to see your demons."

I sighed, "What prefect tme before I have to go to have you on my mind."

He grinned at me.  "So think of it as a reward for surviving him."

I laughed.  "Fine. I still need a shower."  I stood up and and walked to Dorian side of the desk and sat on the edge of it.  He stood up and stepped in front of me pressing against me.  I bit my bottom lip as I stared into his eyes.  His hands ran through the sides of my hair and I couldn't help the sound that left my mouth.  He grinned at me and kissed me softly.

My body was tight against his.  I whispered, "I should go."

Dorian steped back with a lust filled look on his face.  "That enough incentive?"

I kissed him as I stood up and smiled.  "It is."

I left Dorian's office.  I could feel his eyes on me a I walked towards the elevator.  I winked at him as I turned and the elvator doors closed.
