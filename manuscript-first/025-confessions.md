## Confessions

I hated feeling like an invalid, but I couldn't stand more than a few seconds before my knees buckled so Madison had a wheelchair waiting.  She pushed me while an orderly followed with my things which at the moment consisted of mostly paper bags full of food Dorian and Mia had brought me.  Dorian walked beside me.  I wanted to hold his hand, well I wanted to do more than that but it was uncomfortable to move so I kept m hands to myself.  Even sitting in the chair was painful.  Had I really broken every bone in my body?  I remember the pain I felt on inpact, it didn't surprise me really, but every bone?  It did feel like it though.

We took the elevator as the wheelchair wasn't going to manage the stairs.  Dorian knelt down next to and tried to distract me some.  He hummed the little tune again.  I grinned, "You are getting good at that."

He smiled.  "It seems to work for both of us."

"I'll have to remember that."  I said as the doors dinged open and Madison rolled me out of the elevator.  It was a short trip from the infirmary to the level of the pschye residences.  It was a wing in the adult residences with much better security and monitoring.  It said a lot about the Venatori that we had such a wing in our residences.  But then, when there were issues around the world, they came here too.  It was the best place to keep the mentally unstable Venatori and other supernatural creatures.  I heard there were a few dragons and were's here.  Vampires are usually killed my their own kind when they are mentally unstable - they aren't likely to get better.

Madison wheeled me through the locked double doors and stopped by the entrance desk.  She handed them my paperwork.  "This is Mr. Nox SÃ©tanta.  He will be staying with a while.  And this is his friend Dorian Vega.  Mr. Vega needs to be added to the guest list for Nox.  He'll sign the needed paperwork and then you can show him to Nox's room.  He's been given family access."

Family access... I liked that.  They hadn't even asked.  Had Dorian.  But from the questioning look he gave me he hadn't either.  I shrugged and he smiled.  "I'll see you in a few.  I'll take care of this and see you soon."

I nodded but it wasn't like I had a choice Madison pushed me through another set of double doors.  "This is the common room.  You'll spend a good deal of your time here with the others.  It's breakfast time right now so no one is in here."  Madison pointed through another set of double doors.  "In there is the dinning room.  We'll show you that at lunch."  She pushed me through another set of double doors that lead into another hall.  "These are the rooms.  All rooms have windows and cameras with mics so we can hear you.  There is an intercom system if you need something.  Doors are key carded from the outside.  And unlocked during free time so you have access to your rooms if necessary."

We past mostly open doors inside of one I saw a man who's fire element was scattering everywhere, I knew a fire would start shortly and as we passed two doors down the fire alarm went off.  I nodded to myself and found the familiar sound of the blasts almost comforting.  "I can help him."

Madison asked, "What was that?"

"The man they were trying to sedate before he got angry enough to start a fire.  I an help him."

Madison shook her whole body when she spoke, "They've tried everything.  He can't learn, the mental capacity is not there."

I grinned at her.  "I can teach a three year old control I'm sure I can show him what he needs to keep his lid on."

Madison stopped in front of a room that looked very much like the others except the window was large, the door was locked and closed.  She waved her card over the locking mechanism.  "Because you submitted freely we can allow you access to other rooms, but when you aren't with the others you will be in your room with the door locked.  Your visitors will sit with you in here under observation."   She pointed to the three cameras that covered every corner and nook of the room.  "This is Sucicide Watch Level 1."

She sighed, "There are three level.  The next has no windows and really nothing in the room.  The last is complete isolation in a padded room.  I hope you never see the insides of that room."

"I'm not suicidal.  I haven't tried to hurt myself since I was 7." I said with fustration.

"Do you want me to help you out of the chair?  Or do you want to wait for Dorian?"

I shrugged, "The bed is probably more comfortable.  How long can Dorian stay?"

"Today he can stay until visiting hours are over.  They start in two hours and last for three.  That should be enough time to get you settled in."  Madison smiled.  "You really like him don't you?  I don't think I've ever seen you smile that much."

"I do.  Surprises me just as much as anyone else."

Madison helped me stand up and I tried not to put too much weight on her but she was Venatori and a lot stronger than she looked, she helped me with no problem.  By the time Dorian's shadow graced my doorway I was in bed and Madison had set up the table with food.  I was hungry still.

Dorian shook his head.  "I don't think he's ever going to stop eating."

Madison laughed.  "That's a good thing right now.  Today he's on bed rest, tomorrow we will try to get him up and moving and into physical therapy.  He'll need more food during that time I suspect as well.  Nox, I'll have the meal planner sent your way so you can set that up."

"I already gave them that.  Dr. Silverman gave me his unchanged list and I left it at the ront desk with the rest of his paperwork."  Dorian smiled. 

"Seriously, he's that predictable?"

I laughed.  "I've been eating near the same thing for most of my life Madision."

"Alright.  I'll be back in a few hours.  If you need anything there is a button on the bed and one by the door you can use to talk to us.  If you need to use the restroom we will need to have a male nurse go with you."

"I know the drill.  I've been here before."  I sighed and started eating the spread that was laid out in front of me.

Dorian sat down on the bed facing me and dropped another bag in my lap.  "It's all approved.  I figured you could use some distraction."

"A present for me?"  I grinned at him.  Inside the brown paper bag with handles was a composition notebook with blank pages.  "They wouldn't let your usual notebook in - the metal spiral was a danger."  The next thing I pulled out was a box of crayons.  I laughed but Dorian frowned, "They would only allow crayons.  No pencil pens or other implements of that nature."

I grinned at Dorian.  "No this is fine.  I can work with it."

There were several paper back books inside, I didn't recognize the titles, "I figured you could do with a little bit of mind stimulation as well."

I smiled at Dorian.  "Thank you.  What would you like me to draw?"

"Whatever you usually draw."  Dorian said with a smile.

"My drawings are of my nightmares, that's what the journal you must have found was.  Or you'd not know I like to draw."

Dorian blushed.  "I wasn't going to say anything.  I didn't look at much of it.  I liked the last image in the book though."

I smiled.  "Me too.  What would you like me to draw?"

"Whatever Nox.  I figured it could help you pass the time."

"You are no help.  I don't want to draw my nightmares with color.  I guess I'll figure it out."  Dorian just smiled at me.  

I sighed.  "You don't have to stay with me.  This is going to get boring rather fast."

Dorian nodded.  "I know.  But I like seeing you awake.  I can try another session if you'd like."

"Not today.  You nearly passed out.  We don't need you in here too."

Dorian laughed, "That could be interesting."

I raised an eye brow at him and pushed the table to the side and beckoned Dorian to come closer.  He did by scooting up still facing me.  I hurt bending forward but Dorian pushed me backwards and readjusted.  He sat on my lap which was only slightly more comfortable with his weight on my legs. But when he kissed me I forgot all about the discomfort and the pain. Electricity ran through my body when his lips touched mine.  He tasted of wine.  
Dorian's hand lifted my shirt and he touched skin underneath.  I could feel the feather light touches tugging at things much lower.  I let out a soft moan and Dorian smiled through the kiss.  He pulled back and I whispered, "We should stop."

Dorian nodded.  "When you are ready."

I grinned at him.  "We have an audience and I hurt."

"An excuse but don't worry about it Nox."

"You are really waiting on me?"  I asked Dorian.

"This means more to you than me.  I'm not saying I don't care or that you feel more than I do.  But sex for you meant something different.  Yes?"

I nodded.  "You've been talking with Margo or Jace."

"Both actually."  Dorian paused only breifly to touch my cheek and down my neck with his hand and I leaned into his gentle touch.  "I wanted to understand things so I didn't make you feel more at odds with your life.  Dr. Silverman was glad to have me come talk to her, but she said she couldn't tell me specifics.  Not without your written conscent.  Jason forged that consent however without my knowledge, apparently something the two of you did often."

I nodded.  "I don't mind.  Dr. Silverman didn't think you would and filed it with your records before handing me a copy of them.  Everything."

"Everything?"  I grinned, "So you've read her notes after I set Garrett on fire, and after my suicide attempt.  After Dylan beat the shit out of me and after I saved you?"

"Among other things.  Why do you mention those particular times?"  Dorian asked much like Margo would have.

"Because those are the major events that shaped my life.  There are others there as well.  Like the man going to jail, but I don't think Margo knew about it precisely.  She didn't like hearing about my sex life.  That was someone elses department."

Dorian nodded.  "I've his notes too."

"You do?"  I was shocked.

"Do you want me to read them?"  Dorian asked.  "I haven't touched them yet.  We hadn't discussed the situation so I wasn't sure if it was knowledge you wanted me to have."

"You can read anything about me Dorian.  I'm not shocked you have them, I'm shocked that he gave them to Margo after I left the Academy."

"You've not see him since then?"

I shook my head.  "I stopped seeing him when I was 16.  He told me he's taught me all he could and that I was capable of handling my own self in all possible encounters."

"What did he teach you?"

I smiled at Dorian.  "He taught me to control myself, my fears, my anxieties in situations where I lost control.  I met Adrian after Tim went to jail.  I was trying to fill the whole he'd created, Adrian knew I was underage but still he was game if I was.  He pinned me to the wall much like you did the other day but instead of telling him I didn't want to do that I froze, I became obideinet and complient.  I couldn't say no even if I wanted to.  Garrett had beaten it out of me.  That particular situation was beyond my control."

"Adrian stopped then and released me from my prone position and let me free of that fear with a simple 'I can help you.'"  I paused to take in Dorian's expression. "He taught me other words to say no, because I couldn't do it.  It took a while, but I found the safe words worked for me.  He taught me how to be in control whether I was on bottom or top."

I didn't have anything else to add to what Adrian meant to me.  He wasn't a lover, but he was a mentor of sorts.  We sat in silence for a while before Dorian asked, "Did you ever sleep with him?"

I nodded.  "Yes, a few times, but I was 16.  It was more of a final test than anything."  I added, "When I was 13 sex was just a tool to get people to be close to me - to hurt me without having to hurt me.  After Adrian sex was enjoyable.  I still used it to cope and push people away.  But I was in control of it.  It was like learning how to jump off a building.  It was freeing.  Without it I wouldn't be here.  I wouldn't be able to even think about more with anyone and certainly not you."

"Why not me specifically?"  Dorian asked.

I smiled weakly at him, "Because my feelings are so strong for you that I would have hurt you the most because you could hurt me the most."  I leaned back against the bed and stared up at the camera watching us.  "I have wanted you since we were kids.  Saving you was one of my better days.  The feel of your hand in mine when you helped me up.  The way you looked soaked in mud and grime it still tugs deep down inside.  I'd forgotten how I felt about you until I saw you when I came out of the elevator.  And everytime you kiss me or touch me now I can't help but want to have more of it."

Dorian's hands reached around my neck and he pulled me forward and kissed me.  My heart raced and my body ached for him.  When he pulled away he smiled.  "I will do my best not to hurt you, Nox.  I can't promise you I will succeed because relationships aren't something I'm good at.  And certainly, I'm not good at being in this place in a relationship where I have never been before either."

I smiled, "We'll learn together."
