## Children

One of the best things about Isabel was that she enjoyed the life I lived - everything including going for a run instead of walking or taking the train to Central Park where we were going to look for the kids.  It was close to sunset and they would be hanging out in the woods there trying to stay away from the police and others looking for wayward souls.

Isabel slowed to a walk ahead of me and I smiled as she turned to wait for me.  She laughed, "Why do you always fall behind?"

I smiled and licked my lips and took her by the shoulders and we walked together like a proper couple through the wooded path the kids had been last sighted at.  I could see her smiling as we walked, "You still didn't answer me."

"You know why."  I grinned at her.

"I want to hear it."

"I like watching you move."  I squeezed her shoulder against my side affectionately.  We had been sleeping together on a regular basis for the past few weeks, but it was casual, nothing serious.  It was all about the heir, even though we had a great deal of fun preforming our duties.

She sighed as she leaned against me, "Do you ever compare me to Dorian?"

"Never."

She stopped and looked at me quizically, "Why not?"

"Well the obvious reason is he's a guy.  You don't exactly have the parts he does, nor he you.  It's not fair to either of you."  I said flatly and walked past her scanning the trees for the kids we were looking for.

"You love him though.  You can't love me - like ever?"  she asked nervously.

"I do love you.  If that's what you want to call what we have."  I took a few more steps forward then turned to face Isabel and her dark eyes shining with tears.  "I don't do relationships at least not before Dorian.  He's my first love, he will always be that.  Yes I love him.  But that doesn't mean I don't have room to find love with you.  I enjoy your company.  I want to make you happy.  I care a great deal about you.  None of these things have ever happened to anyone other than you and Dorian.  So that... " I waved my hands in the space between us, "this... is a good thing. You accepted the fact that I like men - and specifically Dorian.  Izz I am not going to have sex with anyone other than you."

"Except Dorian."  Isabel added.  She closed the distance between us.  "You can't make that promise to me and not include Dorian Nox.  I accepted that, not that ou liked men.  If you seriously want to make us official Nox, Dorian is included in the two of us.  He has to be, or you'll die of sorrow.  I'm not blind to your nightmares.  Your dreams are wrapped up in him.  They center on your demons hurting him now.  They are what peirce through the din that the pack creates in your head.  Everyone sees it on a preferial level anyway - we all know what Dorian means to you."

"I'll make whatever promise you wante Izz.  I will be faithful to you - and to the memory of Dorian.  Elena wants a strong woman by my side.  Auto agrees that you fit the bill.  When they agree I need to listen right?"

Isabel laughed, "Yeah.  But is that why you'd make this official?"

I shook my head.  "No ma'am.  I wasn't lying when I said I do love you.  It's just not the all consuming love I have for Dorian.  I want this with you.  Son or not."

Isabel wrapped her arms around my waist and pulled me in the direction of the woods, "Oh, we'll have a son."  She sniffed the air and I caught the shimmer of her shifting into wolf form.  Her gray and white fur standing stark in the dim light of dusk.  I picked up her clothes and tossed them in the bag we'd brought for just that occassion and I followed the female wolf through the woods, she'd found their scent.

We walked into what I could only describe as a homeless camp - except there was nothing but children here.  No one was older than 15 from the looks of it.  When Isabel's wolf form stepped into the fire light surrounding them most of the children scattered.  I tried to catch one before he ran past me but he slipped through my fingers as I closed them.   But two remained staring at me and not at Isabel's wolf form.  Neither of them moved.  I knelt down on the ground and Isabel laid down with her head on my knee watching the boys carefully.  

I held out my hand to them.  "My name is Nox.  This is Isabel."  I rubbed behind Izzy's ear and she gave a satisfied growl which made the boys take a step back.  "You know what I am?"

They shook their heads.  I asked, "Do you know what she is?"  Again they shook their heads.  "Do you know your parents?"

Again they shook their heads.  "Why didn't you run with the others."

The smaller of the two boys started waving his hands around like I should understand.  And then I realized he saw my power.  He wasn't a were I looked deeper and while he wasn't Venatori he saw auras.  A human child with the gift.

"Can you talk? either of you."  The smaller boy nodded as did the other boy.  "I can help you, but I need to know if your parents know where you are?"

They shook their heads.  The bigger boy spoke in a whisper, "They are dead.  Killed by..."  He pointed to Isabel.

"Izzy didn't kill your parents.  But we can figure out who did, if you want to come with me.  We'll give you a hot bath, hot food, some clean clothes, a warm place to sleep and help you figure out what's going on."

They both nodded.  I was sure that they didn't care so much about the offer of help as they did for hot food.  "Alright.  We need to wait for Izzy okay?"

Isabel took the bag in her mouth and went to a nearby bush and shifted again.  I was starting to learn that not all werewolves could shift on command.  Isabel could, so could Auto and Elena.  But it was a sign of power.  Another reason Elena approved of Isabel.

Isabel stepped out wearing her jeans and my t-shirt that was in the bag and I grinned at her.  The boys were staring at her with wide eyes.  "She's a werewolf."

"Yeah.  But she's not the bad kind."  I took Izzy's hand and kissed it softly.  I held my hand out to the boys and the bigger one took it and he took the other boys but he stayed put as we started walking.  

I stopped and offered him my hand and he took it and I scopped the small one up into my arms and carried him.  Isabel's hand on my waiste and the other boy holding my hand.

When we got back to the pack house there was a crowd outside.  No one was supposed to be here.  There were no meetings, but the talking stopped the moment I stepped into the light of the street lamp outside our front door.

The kids held tightly to me and I heard Isabel growl.

"Am I interrupting something?"  I asked playfully.

Isabel's hand tightened on my waist, she felt trouble.  I wasn't worried.  I reached for my ability, which now was carefully entwined with the magic of the pack and I let it flow all around me.  Isabel dropped to a knee as she steadied herself against me, she felt the power and bowed to it but not out of fear.  

The others, they bowed out of fear.  There was no respect in their eyes.  One man stood amongst the others.  "You aren't one of us.  I challenge your authority over the pack."

"I accept."

The crowd parted and I noticed that James was standing in the doorway.  But the man didn't wait for me to go down stairs, he attacked me in the dim lights of New York City.  I sighed and I snapped his neck as he rushed me.  If they weren't going to play fair neither would I.

I looked at the rest of the men in question.  "Are there anymore tonight?  I seriously hate losing good men."

When no one answered I walked through carrying the little boy and the other followed on my heels.  Isabel followed him but no man moved from their spot on the ground cowering before their Alpha.  I had been challeneged nearly every week since I became Alpha, "You'd really think they'd learn." James said as I walked past him.

"You'd think."  I called out into the house.  "Emily can we get some clean clothes and a bath for these two?"

Emily stepped out of the kitchen with a surprised look on her face.  She took in the dirty children and wisked them away like any mother would.  I turned back to James, "I assume you are here for me?"

He nodded. "In private."
