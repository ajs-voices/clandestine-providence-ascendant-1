## Going To The Big Man

I walked slowly stalling.  I was regretting telling Dorian not to come with me I could use his strength and his calm.  My anxiety was ratching up a notch each floor I walked up the stairs.  I only managed three flights of stairs before I had to stop and catch my breath because I couldn't breathe.

I took the door at the landing and used the elevator to the top floor.  My panic didn't die down, but at least it wasn't ratcheting each step I took.  I closed my eyes and stayed in the back of the elevator until I was alone on the last floor before the penthouse.

The doors dinged open and I stepped out into the lobby of the penthouse.  It was posh and plush with a few ways to go.  Normally I'd go to the left to the roof, but today I had to go into the residences.  I'd never been there, but everyone knew where Mark Green lived.  And I walked slowly through the golden tiles on the floor.  Everything looked rich and regal.  It was how the leader of the Venatori and our primary funding chose to live - in the lap of luxury.  I rolled my eyes at the thought.

Mark's door was inlaid with a carving in each panel - a great grand door made of oak from the look of it.  I knocked.

I waited for several minutes before an old balding man answered the door and I nodded an informal bow.  "I need to talk to you, sir."

"I know you beleive in making appointments.  So why are you here?"  Mark Green's voice was solid and unwavering and I could hear the hint of irony in it.

"It can't wait, sir."

He stepped aside and lead me to his sitting room.  It was a large library like room - lined with books and a few chairs in a circle in the middle of the room.  Our illustrous leader took a seat in a high backed plush chair made with crushed velvet in a plum color.  Very throne like if you asked me.

I took a less posh chair as required of my station and Mark Green smiled slightly at the gesture.

I took a deep breath.  "I was approached for something unthinkable."

The gray eyes of the man who'd once sent me away so I didn't have to deal with the procreation decree right away were curious.  I could see the tiny lines at the edge of his eyes crinkling with amusement.  "And what was that?"

"I was asked to get your current schedule for the next two weeks, and today I learned that I was to kill you in those two weeks."  I said flatly.  There was no need to hide anything under subtrefuge.

He raised his hand and three security guards stepped out of their hiding spots and I laughed as I leaned back in the chair with my hands up in the air.  "You all know I could have killed him the moment opened the door right.  I know you are aware of my knack for using my ability faster than most individuals."

Mark Green nodded.  "Oh they aren't here for you.  If I were worried Nox.  I wouldn't have opened the door."

"So what are they here for?"I waved my hands at his bodyguards.

He sighed.  And one of the guards handed him a folder.  "Various things.  This is the information you have recently accessed.  None of it of much use except that you looked at my schedule today.  It seems your record has been being perused by Dorian Vega as of late.  Why is that?"

I smiled.  "Because he was trying to learn more about me without asking me."

"Why would he do that?"

"Because we are seeing each other."  I said with a ironic grin.

Mark Green nodded.  "He is throrough."

I nodded.  "That's Dorian."

Mark nodded absently like he was lost in thought.  "I do not want you to talk anymore to me about this.  And I will not tell you of my plan that you have now become critical to.  You won't like this, but you are a good hunter and you will figure it all out.  When it's safe someone will find you.  But tomorrow you will do as you are asked.  In the morning when I go to eat breakfast in a near empty cafeteria you will come and throw a fireball at me.  Your weapon of choice correct."

I could only stare at him and he gave me a grim smile.  "There will be consequences, but they are necessary."  He continued.  "I will not tell you to not tell Dorian or your family what you are about to do, but I suggest you refrain from it least of all the wrong ears hear.  Someone will find you.  You will find that there is a new appointment in your calendar with a meeting with me about your progeny assignments.  Asher will be in touch."

A man took me by the arm and lifted me from the seat and Mark stood up and gave me a weak smile. "Good luck in the future, my boy.  I wish things could be different."

The only thing running through my mind as I was shown the door was What the fuck was going on.

I made my way to the elevator and rode it until the door dinged open on Dorian's floor and I stepped out still in a daze.  I was really going to do this...

I didn't remember walking to Dorian's apartment or even knocking on the door but I saw those beautiful blue eyes staring at me with saddness.  He pulled me inside and took me in his arms and hugged me tightly.  "I'm sorry Nox."

I blinked, "For what?"

"Whatever happened.  Whatever it is."

I pulled back and kissed Dorian thoroughly until we were both desparate for air.  I stepped away from Dorian and pulled him towards his bedroom.  Dorian's eyes went wide with concern but he followed me.  I locked the bedroom door behind us and pushed Dorian on to the bed he was still wearing jeans and a t-shirt and I liked the look of his disheveled hair splayed on the white comforter of his bed.  I crawled on top of him and kissed him like it was the last time I would do it forever.  And it likely was.  My heart sank as I kissed him and Dorian pushed me up to look at my face which I buried my tears in the side of his neck and bit and nipped at the place just under his ear I loved so much.  Dorian moaned softly in my ear.  

I whispered between kisses against his skin.  "Mark. Wants. Me. To. Try. To. Kill. Him."  I bit excesseivly hard to keep Dorian's attention on me and not my words.  He squirmed underneath me and used his strength to overpower me and rolled me over so he pressed my body to the bed and my hands over my head as he looked down at me.  He kissed me like it was the last time would.  

I could feel the implication in his breath on my neck as he spoke next. "You'll be killed," he whispered in my ear.

I shook my head and I kissed Dorian then whispered against his lips as I moved my hips underneath him and he let out a small moan, "He says someone will find me."

Dorian nipped at my lip and kissed along my jaw to my ear and just below he bit and sucked hard I could feel the blood rushing through my body and my body ached for the touch of Dorian's skin against my body.  He whispered against my neck, "He means to exile you."

I whispered, "He has a plan.  I don't know what it is, but he's giving me one more night with you.  Let's not waste it on worrying."  I wrapped my legs around Dorian and pushed myself into him as close as our clothes would allow.

Dorian nodded and kissed me; the rest was bliss.
