## Father and Sons

Jo stared off at the wall in front of her before she finally said something.  "I'm sorry about last night."

I shrugged and leaned back against my bed, my head resting against the wall.  "No worries.  Finding out you are a werewolf is kinda a shocker to anyone.  I take it you've not turned yet."

Jo shook her head.  "Our were professor says it happens at different ages for different creatures, but a werewolf in their early twenties.  You shouldn't be in here you should be with a pack."

Jo was pale and staring straight ahead.  I wasn't sure she was even listening to me.  "I might know an alpha who can help you.  Though he's not part of a pack.  And fledgling wolves do better in packs.  If you were a tiger you'd probably be alright with finding another to teach you as they are solitary creatures even out in the wild."

Jo turned and looked at me, "You sure know alot about werewolves for being ... what did Lori call you?"

"Magnus.  Cesari specifically.  But I'm Venatori - well half anyway.  It's my job to know about the supernatural races.  I can't exactly hunt them if I don't know anything about them can I?"

I didn't think Jo could get any lighter but she did, all color washed from her as she whispred, "You hunt us?"  Her eyes grew angry and hateful, "Do you kill us too?"

I shook my head.  "I try not.  But I'm rare in that department.  I've killed those that attacked me.  But I tend to capture and let there be a trial."

Jo leaned back like I was and curled against my side which I thought was odd, but I didn't object.  She whispered, "You smell like a forest."

I grinned, "That's a new one.  Usually I smell like a campfire."

I feel Jo taking a deep breath against my skin with a soft nod, "That too."

There was a soft knock on my door and Jo sat bold upright and scurried out the door before I even had time to tell her it was alright.  I watched her hurry past my father who was staring at me in wonderment.  "Does Dorian know?"

"Does he know what?"  I asked.

Kai nodded after Jo, "The girl scurrying away from your bed."

I shrugged.  "I wasn't doing anything."

Kai only nodded and pulled the chair to the side.  "You look better.  Dorian told me you could move today?"

I nodded.  "Since when do you talk to Dorian about my well-being?"

"Since he spent nearly every night sleeping in a chair by your bed while you were unconsious."  He smiled at me.  "Don't hurt him, or I'll Emilio have you."

I grinned at my father.  "I have no intentions of hurting Dorian, Dad.  I like Dorian."

"Dad?"  Kai asked with a smile.

"It felt right."

He stood up and offered me a hand, "Let's go to the gym, get you back in shape.  I'll take it easy on you."

I took his hand and we walked to what the ward called their gym.  It was mostly cardio equipment, but there was an area where it looked like yoga or other cardio classes too place - there was not a weight in sight.  I sighed.  Kai only laughed.  "Sparring?"

I nodded, "Alright."

I took my socks and shoes off and stretched a little while my father watched me.  "You are moving stiffly, a little more stretching than usual."

I nodded and continued with what I'd been doing, I agreed with him.

I could feel the ache in my muscles despite the healing Dorian had done.  I still could barely touch my gift, but at least I could move more freely without too much pain.  

I stood up and took a fighting stance and my father followed suit.  He grinned at me, "No cheating."

I stuck my tongue out at him.  "I can't touch my ability which puts me at a disadvantage."

Kai smiled, "I'll go easy on ya.  This time."  

But I knew better than that, his easy wasn't going to be the same as my easy and he proved that point when he threw the first punch which I blocked and I felt the bruise blooming on my forearm.  My father was full Venatori which meant super human strength to my normal strength.  But I reached for my ability and cased myself in air.  My father frowned.  "That is not fair.  I thought you said..."

I smiled.  "I'm not going to walk around looking like you beat me up.  I can't do much more than this though."

He nodded, "Fair enough."

We danced around each other gauging the other's speed and ferocity before my father let loose.  He jabbed me in the stomach and smacked me upside the head twice but I got in a few good licks before he held up his hands breathing heavy.  I bent over to catch my breath as my father patted my back.  "Well done, and for being injured I'm impressed."

That was high praise coming from my father.  He sat down and stretched again.  I followed suit, there was no need to hurt myself further.  He looked over at me, "That girl.  Who is she?"

"Jo?  She's a werewolf - though she didn't know that before yesterday when I told her."

"She looks familiar."  Kai mumbled to himself as he popped the water bottle he had with him and handed it to me.

We didn't speak much more until we were in the hall and heading back to my room.  I needed a shower.  "How are prospects coming?"

I frowned at him not knowing what he was talking about, he added, "The Dowager girl and several others had appoints with you before all this happened."

"Ah."  I shook my head.  "Reschedule them I guess, they can come visit me here.  Same with all those other people who wanted to talk to me."

Kai nodded, "Would you like me to do that for you?"

I shrugged, "Dae'lin usually handles it but that's up to you.  I've limited time here and Dorian gets first dibs."

"You really are serious about him?"  He shook his head.  "I find it very hard to believe that two of my sons like the same sex."

I smiled at my father.  "I like women too, unlike Nick."

"I know but that doesn't make it any better.  I wonder where I failed."

"You didn't fail either of us.  You had no chance with me and Nick just likes guys nothing you could have done either way.  I like Dorian a lot.  I get he's a family friend, but to me, he's just a kid I want to school with and had a crush on.  I wasn't part of the Viddens Vega family relationship until now.  I'm not going to hurt your best friends son on purpose.  Dorian's a good man."

Kai laughed, "I never saw you for the settle down type."

"I want a family.  A big happy family one day.  I doubt it'll be traditional since I'm not exactly follow the rules sort of guy."  I opened the door to my bedroom.  "I need a shower, Dad.  Come by again and we can do it again."

Kai nodded.  "That sounds like a plan.  I'll schedule that in too."

I grinned.  "You are getting the idea."

Kai shook my hand and I stepped into my room to grab a change of clothes before heading down to the showers.
