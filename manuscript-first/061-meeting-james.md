## Meeting James

I woke soaked in sweet and tears to the sun streaming in my bedroom window alone.  I curled around my pillows and searched the nightstand for my phone, and when I couldn't find it I sat up and crawled out of bed.  Someone had removed it to let me sleep which meant I was late.

I walked down stairs without changing into anything, just the sweats and no shirt that I'd been wearing when I woke up to find Dorian in the pack bedroom.  I shivered as the cool air from the morning soaked into my skin.  In the kitchen I found Emily cooking for the clan and I felt a stab of jealousy, but there was a smile when everyone noticed me standing in the door way.  

Emily stopped what she was doing and wiped her hands on her apron and walked me to a spot at the bar for breakfast.  "You look worse than yesterday."

Raf was the one to answer, "Dorian told him last night."

I wanted to be angry, "Everyone knows already?"

Emily nodded, "That Dorian is getting married.  Yes, darling everyone has been keeping that secret from you for far to long."

"Seriously?"  I dropped my head to the table.  I sat up straight and resolved to do what I had to do.  "I'm going for a run."  Raf and Jo started to get up and I sighed, "Alone!"

They sat back down and nodded.  It hadn't been an order, but it felt like one.  I grabbed a hoodie and pulled on shoes and just started running.  I don't know how long I ran or how far I'd left my phone wherever it had been placed to let me sleep in.  It didn't matter I was exhausted and when I finally graced the door of the building I nearly ran into Elena as she was exiting.  "Sorry."

"I heard darling, I'm so sorry.  Come inside I was just looking for you."  She took me by the elbow and drew me inside into the living room, "Sit darling."

"I really need a shower Elena."

She smiled, "You are perfectly presentable.  Though the color is missing."

I grinned at her, "Fire does that when it burns away everything."

She nodded as if what I'd said was perfectly acceptable.  "James would like you to come to dinner tonight with Charles and I.  There will be other officers there.  You've moved in seamlessly into our culture and even taken it upon yourself to look out for others and you didn't have to.  And your recent interactions with the vampires and Venatori.  They'd like to know how far your connections go."

I rolled my eyes.  "My connections in the Venatori just died, I'm dead now."

Elena shook her head, "No darling it's not. You know how they work, where we can best make changes.  You have knowledge James wants to understand how much."

"Fine, what time.  I have to get to work I'm already late."

Elena laughed, "Auto's already cleared you'd a day off.  He said inventory can wait another day.  Besides you did just rise from the ashes, I think you can do with a day off."  Elena looked at Raf and Jo who were standing behind me as far as I could tell from the connection I had with them now.  She smiled at them.  "Take him shopping, on me."

Raf groaned and so did I.  But I was the only one who commented, "Really?  Because I like to wear make up, [aint my nails, color my hair and like men you think I'd enjoy shopping.  Do I look like I care who Versace is?"

Elena laughed.  "You should."

I rolled my eyes.  Raf laughed, "We could go to the gym.  Some of the other wolves go to a particular one that has boxing ring, we could go a few rounds."

Elena waved it away, "He'll get a black eye."

Jo snickered, "It's not like he won't heal, Elena.  He heals faster than we do."

Emily nodded, "It'll be good for him to get out and hit things.  A good outlet."

"Throwing fireballs would feel better, but I suppose a few rounds couldn't hurt."

Raf got up and ran up the stairs, Jo handed me my phone and I turned it off and stuck it in my hoodie pocket as I went up stairs to at least get presentable.  And yes I showered, threw blue and red and orange into my hair haphazardly and made sure the eyeliner was thick and waterproof before I was back downstairs in workout gear. 

Jo and Raf were standing downstairs waiting on me, Michael looked up at me and smiled.  "Of course he plays gay for the guys."

I laughed.  "I did it on purpose."

Elena giggled.  "I'm going to enjoy watching this."

Emily sighed, "Elena,  you could stay with me and we could chat."

Elena shook her head, "Not a chance, darling, I want to see our own Venatori up against a wolf in a fair fight."

I laughed as I started at a jog out the door, Raf sprinted past me and took the lead.  I called after me, "Who said anything about fair."

Elena beat us there with Jo and a few other of the clan who hadn't wanted to run with us.  Raf enjoyed running with me, so did Jo, but she went with Elena at Elena's insistance.

Jo was leaning against the wall next to the door and grabbed my arm before I went in and pulled me aside into the near by alley way.  "Elena's going to try and fix you up.  I refused her flat out.  But now that Dorian's out of your rear view mirror she wants you mated."

I sighed.  "Jo, Dorian isn't out of the picture, he never will be.  I need him more than I need air."

Jo nodded.  "I know.  But he thinks you are dead, and you need a mate if you want to stay Alpha."

"We'll deal with that as we have to."  We went inside together and there was already a match in progress.  I started warming up off to the side.  I didn't want to hurt myself, and I wasn't sure how much my body had truly healed from the fire.  I could feel every stretch as I moved.

Elena stood next to a large man with the aura of a were, I couldn't tell what kind, but everyone in this place was a were except me.  He was powerful, it made me wonder if he was an Alpha.  It would be interesting to know if I could see that just like I could see Magnus status.  

The bell rang and the loser hopped out of the ring and the man Elena was talking to jumped in.  He bounced around the ring several times before the bell rang and they started circling one another.

It started out like every boxing matched I'd ever seen, punch after punch and then the man Elena had been talking to did a round house kick to his opponents head and the man fell to the ground and didn't get back up.  

The other man's friends dragged him out, slapping his face and pouring water on him to wake him up and make sure he was alright.  I saw his chest rising and falling and knew he'd be alright.  The man left in the ring, he walked over to the edge neaest me and pointed at me, "I want the new guy."

Great.  I stood up and nodded and stretched my arms as I climbed into the ring with one quick motion.  I heard all sorts of comments as I put on the proofered gloves.  "Kill the pretty boy."  "Don't break a nail."  "Watch for the boner."

I just rolled my eyes and took a fighting stance in front of the man Elena had been talking to.  Before the bell rang I held out my hand and the other man bumped it and I smiled.  "Alright, let's get this over with."

I took a deep breath and wove air around my arms and legs to help with the defense.  I wasn't going to let this man break me because he was stronger than I was by default.  We danced in a circle for a good two minutes to the disappointment of the crowd, so I decided to have a little fun with it and set off a few fireworks on the outside of the ring.  The man turned to look and I swept his leg out from under him.  "Sorry man."

That was enough for him to go full bore on me.  He swung and I blocked.  He repeated the onslaught as we danced around the ring.  He tried to get me in a corner but I ducked out of his reach just in time and would smack him across the back.  I didn't play fair.  And he knew it, I saw the moment it switched.  He threw down the gloves and took off the head gear and I followed suit.  I wasn't finished removing the protective gear when he came at me swinging with a series of kicks I had to block, but the last one landed against my rib cage and I could feel the bruise that was going to form, but I dropped to the ground and swept his feet out from him and he fell to the ring floor, but he popped back up with a smile.

We traded blows for a while before a bell sounded and he reached across the ring with an outstreched hand, he was panting with the exertion and so was I.  "Hi, I'm James Wright.  It's very good to meet you Nox."

I smiled.  He was more than Alpha, he was **the** Alpha.
