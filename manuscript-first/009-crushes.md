## Crushes

The elevator doors opened on the conference floor and there was a crowd milling about outside of the closed double doors.  My heart beat fast as I stepped on to the hard wood floors and I could hear the soft clicking of the souls of my fancy dress shoes on the floor.  It sounded like I had a tack stuck in the bottom.  

I stepped to the side and leaned against the wall and lifted the offending foot over my knee and saw the tiny metalic peice sticking out.  I rolled my eyes.  Glad I hadn't been barefoot when I stepped on it.  I had to use air and fire to get the peice out of the sole of my shoe.

I melted the small tack into a small ball of molten metal when someone cleared their throat to catch my attention.  I looked up with the small ball floating above my hand.  My face split into a wide grin.  I knew that face.  I hadn't seen it in many years.  He asked me, "Nox SÃ©tanta?"

I nodded. "Yeah."

He breathed a sigh of relief through luscious lips.  I took a moment to remember the masculane features of the boy I remembered.  His mustashe and goatee were neatly groomed and kept at the perfect length.  He wore none of the makeup he had as a teenage - that was a surprise.  His hair was perfect.  I didn't know how he kept it so, even after he ran his fingers through it in fustration.  "Nox?"

I snapped out of my revelry and smiled.  "Sorry.  What did you say?"

He sighed and I could see the signs of anger flash across his face.  A small ripple of lines in his forehead and at the corners of his mouth.  I knew he didn't like to repeat himself - it had been one of the things that everyone in the Academy knew about Dorian Vega.  The quickest way to get under his skin was to make him repeat himself.  

"The presentation in front of you is running long.  Is that alright?"  Dorian repeated, the aggravation was clear in his voice.

I nodded. "Anything to prolong this."

Dorian smiled at the joke.  "You look nervous.  Come with me?"

I followed him through the crowd.  I had to break myself from watching him move.  He was graceful like a cat.  He didn't have the typical gay swagger of really out men.  He walked with the grace of a dancer like he knew what every muscle did and how to make it even more attractive.  He had always been the perfectionist.

We walked into an employee's only room and I was suprised to find it empty save for the couches and tables that made up this break room.  He turned to me, "Coffee?"

I held up my cup.  "I'm good, thanks."

He walked over to me and I could smell a soft scent of cinamon and vanilla coming off of him over the dark musk of his cologne.  I took a deep breath and closed my eyes and I let my self relax.  I sensed more than saw that he had offered me his hand, I took it it without opening my eyes and shook firmly.  He spoke softly, "I'm Dorian Vega - coordinator of this lovely event."  His hands were soft yet firm.  I didn't want to let go.

I nodded and opened my eyes and stared into his deep blue eyes.  "I know who you are.  I saved you once upon a time, a long time ago."  He slipped his fingers from mine trailing along my long fingers and I wonder if he had done that on purpose.

Dorian blushed and nodded.  "Yes.  I wasn't sure you'd remember me."

I grinned at him.  "One does not forget a goregous man landing on top of you."

The rose color rose higher along Dorian's neck it almost reached his ears.  He nervously looked away.  Awwww...

He took my folders from me and the paper cup my coffee had come in and set them on the end table nearby.  Then turned back to me.  "I never did get to properly thank you."  He straightened the shoulders of my jacket and adjusted my tie.  The feeling of his fingers against my shirt sent shivers up my spine.  I had had a crush on this man since before he'd been accidentally pushed over the edge of the roof and I dove over to save him.

"I'd like to get together over dinner, if that's alright to properly thank you for saving my life and talk about your theories."  Dorian sounded a littled awed at the last statement.

"Are you asking me on a date?"  I flirted.

Dorian never looked up from my tie that he was meticuoulsly straightening and retying.  "It's not..."  He paused and then looked up at me through lowered eyelids.  "Yes."

I grinned at him.  "I think we can manage that."

The door opened and Dae'lin stepped inside, "There you are."

I rolled my eyes as she turned me around and started straightening my tie again.  She pushed a lock of my hair that had fallen over my eyes and sighed at the red still tipping them.  "You still do this?"  

I rolled my eyes at her last statement and sighed, but ignored it altogether.  "Dorian just did that Dae'lin and I think he's better at it then you ."  I pushed her small hands from tie.  "So leave it be."

The small raven haired women who had been my mentor looked taken aback as she stared up at me from her 5 foot status.  I grinned down at her.  "Nice to see you too, Dae'lin."

She pushed me aside and looked to Dorian.  "How could you let that baffoon in there run over like this?"

I could feel the anger rolling off Dae'lin as she confronted Dorian but he kept his feelings in check.  "Dae'lin, your student here is fine with it.  He's not a child anymore.  You don't have to speak up for him.  He's more than capable of it himself."

"Yeah, Dae'lin.  What he said."  I grinned at them both.  I heard the doors open.  "Dae'lin, I think it's time.  Can you take my notes to the podium?"

She looked at me sideways.  "Are you trying to get rid of me?"

I nodded.  "Yes, ma'am."

She rolled her eyes and grabbed the folder of my notes and headed for the door.  "Don't keep them waiting too long, Nox."

"I won't," I reassured her.

I turned to look at Dorian.  "Sorry about that.  Can I call you later about those dinner plans?"

Dorian nodded.  "It doesn't have to be today.  I know you just got back in town."

I shrugged.  "Tonight's as good as any. I just don't know what little miss bossy pants has in scheduled for me after this."

"I don't have a card on me.  You can look me up in the directory."  Dorian suggested.

I pulled my phone out of my pocket and handed it to him.  "Call yourself."

He smiled at me and took my phone, his fingers brushing the back of my hand and I felt sparks ignite across my flesh.  I had to swallow hard or choke on the lust that had taken up residence in my system.  I watched as he called himself.  The phone in his pocket rang and then abruptly cut off.  He handed my phone back to me with a small smile, he was careful not to touch me again and I felt a stab of loss at the missed oppurtunity.

Dorian held his hand out and ushered me out the door to the stage entrance.  He turned me around and adjusted my tie one more time and dusted off my shoulders and smiled.  He ran one finger under the rogue colored lock of hair that had fallen back where I liked to reside over my right eye with a smile.  "I always did like it.  Good luck.  And just be yourself, you'll do great."

I'm glad he had more confidence in me than I had in myself.  I was still not ready for this.
