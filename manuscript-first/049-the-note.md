## The Note

I started awake as usual when I had a nightmare.  The clock on the nightstand next to my head read 8am.  I hadn't slept too long Gregory was still lying next to me, his arm wrapped protectively around my waist.  I unfurled from him and he rolled over with a grumble. "It's too early."

My head was aching.  I hadn't drank that much in a very long time.  I wasn't drunk, I didn't do anything stupid, but I felt it now.  I rummaged around on Gregory's desk and found some Tylenol and popped two pills into my mouth and swallowed.  I wrote Gregory a note that said I'd be back after my run.

I didn't bother changing clothes, there really was no point.  I could shower then change, laundry was going to be come an expense I could hardly manage.  This was going to be rough.

I went for my run and on my way back I stopped at a Star bucks and picked up four coffees and headed back to the brown stone.  It was a splurge I realized after I'd done it.  I was going to have to break the habit.

I knocked on the door and had to wait several times before a half naked girl wearing Stephen's shirt opened the door.  "We aren't interested."

I grinned at her.  "Gregory let me stay I just went for a run."

She looked up the stairs behind her when someone mumbled and stepped aside letting me.  "Coffee."  Stephan pulled a cup from the carrier and handed it to the girl then took one himself.

He grinned at me, "You and Gregs were quiet last night."

I winked at him.  "I don't kiss and tell."

He punched me in the shoulder and laughed.  I rolled my eyes, "We didn't do anything. I have a boyfriend."

His jaw dropped and exclaimed, "Shut up!"

I set the fourth cup on the kitchen counter and sipped at mine.  It tasted horrible, how had I gotten used to Dorian's expensive brand so fast.  But it was coffee.

I rummaged around in the fridge and found very little to cook for breakfast and sighed.  Coffee it would be.  That might become the staple of his life.

Gregory came stumbling into the living room as I sat down on the couch sipping my coffee.  He said, "I smell coffee."

I pointed to the cup on the counter.  "That's yours."

He grinned and picked it up then flopped down on to the couch his legs over mine as he leaned his head on the arm of the couch.  The girl commented, "They act like an old married couple."

Stephan laughed.  "So far from the truth it's funny."

Gregory handed me a peice of paper.  "This was on the bed when I woke up."

I took it and looked at it.  I recalled the hand in my pocket of the guard that workded for Mark Green.  I unfolded it and inside was  a series of numbers.  Date, time and a phone number.  It was in three days.  I sighed and tucked it back into my pocket.  It seemed I had a date.

There was a knock at the door and Gregory hopped up quickly, "I got it."

Gregory was speaking in a hushed whisper until he stepped back into the living room.   Followed by him was a very large hispanic man who was white smile was a great contrast against his golden skin.  I rolled my eyes.  "You called Adrian?"

"He's my Alpha I had to." Gregory said calmly.  Gregory blushed, "He's your Alpha too."

I stood up and offered Adrian my hand.  "Been a while."

"Thirteen years if I recall. A lot has changed since I let you go."  His voice was perfectly spoken English, when I'd first met him his words were always tinged with that awesome spanish accent but now I could hear the Brooklyn in him.  Adrian sniffed the air around me then looked at Gregory.  "But you are wrong.  I'm no longer his Alpha."  He looked at me, "You've grown into your power well.  I can smell the forest just under the campfire."

I raised my eyebrow.  "You aren't the first person to tell me that.  I was never part of your pack.  Why do I smell like a forest?"

Adrian sat down next to me I could feel part of my leg pinned under his much larger frame.  I didn't move but I knew I should.  He leaned in close and placed his nose against my neck and I could feel his breath on my neck.  "Dude, it's been a long time since we've done anything like this, mind if you tell me what youare doing."

"Smelling the wolf on you."  Adrian said with a growl.

"That was days ago."

He pulled back and looked at me with a stunned look.  "What was days ago?"

"I helped a little wolf change.  We were in the pschye ward together.  She would have hurt someone."

The relief was strong in Adrian's dark eyes.  "Whew, you didn't change.  I thought maybe..."

"That I was a werewolf?"  I laughed.

He shook his head, "It would have been a first.  But you've always smelled like forest to me underneat that smoke of the campfire."

Gregory nodded and sat down next to me, pulling me closer to him and wrapping his arms around me protectively.  "Me too."

"Really?"

Adrian smiled.  "This little wolf didn't hurt you?  She submitted to your will?"

"She didn't hurt me," I said flatly.  "She laid with me all night instead of howling or trying to reach the hunt."

Adrian shook his head.  "Only an Alpha can do that Nox."

"I'm not a werewolf."  I complained.

"Doesn't matter.  Something makes you smell like the forest and you are an Alpha.  I suspected it before I let you go.  It's why I let you go before you challenged me.  Habit I suppose.  You are not were and couldn't lead the pack."  Adrian smiled.  "Where is your pack now?"

"My pack?"

"The girl you helped.  I smell her on you."  Gregory said.

"Still in the pschye ward I assume.  I was going to call you Adrian, she needs a pack.  She can't stay in there.  Jo will hurt someone."

Adrian shook his head, "She has a pack.  I can talk with Dr. Silverman and get her released under your leadership but you are her Alpha since you helped her change and since you aren't a were it's hard to transfer that bond she created with you to another."

"How the fuck..."  I sighed.  "I hate this."

"You hate what?" Adrian asked.

"Being different.  Before I left my doctors decided posioning me to prove my immortality was a good idea."  I sighed and drank the last of my coffee burning the top of my mouth.  I tried to play it off but Gregory was snickering in my ear as I lounged against his chest.

"Immortality?"  Adrian asked.

"That's what they say.  I'd rather not test the theory."

Greggory laughed.  "But that could be fun."

I rolled my eyes which I knew he couldn't see.  "Yeah sure."

Adrian moved away from us on the couch and turned to face me and looked highly serious which frightened me just a little.  "Nox, tell me what's going on.  Why have you been exiled?"

"I'd rather not talk about it.  Nothing you can do about it.  I fucked up and now I have to pay the consequences."

Adrian shook his head, "You don't just fuck up Nox.  You never have, not once in the years I've known your skinny ass."

I stuck my tongue out at him.  "I tried to kill Mark Green to save my boyfriend, his son and the boy's mother.  I did it willingly, knowingly.  I was coheresed but the consequences could have been worse."

"You didn't succeed then, other wise you'd be leading the Venatori.  They've the same rules we do even if your lot doesn't follow it as stricktly."  Adrian said calmly.

I stood up and started pacing.  "I am part of some larger plan.  That's all I know.  I have a meeting in three days, phone call to make whatever."

Adrian leaned back, "Have you spoken to Marco yet about this?"

I shook my head.  "Why would I have talked to Marco?"

Adrian sighed. "There have been rumblings around the supernatural watercooler.  The Venatori have been a hot topic for a while.  The vampires have a lot of eyes and ears.  Marco could help."

"Marco and Bernstein have their own problems.  My father is hunting them.  Though they claim their kiss isn't involved in the crimes Kai says they are." I informed them.

Adrian sighed, "Put the New York vamps against the Venatori and those rumblings become actionable.  Nox you need to watch your back."

I shrugged, "I always have to."
