# Part II: Terror

## Rise and Fall of Nightmares

There was only darkness at first.  And then the pain.  The bone shattering, blood boiling pain radiating through every cell in my body.  Clarity never resolved, everything remained black and pain filled.  Seconds, minutes, days of nothing but soul crushing pain waved through my body.  And then clarity came - a voice in my head that said, "You are mine."

The red eyes of my demons tormmented me from that moment out.  Unable to move, unable to breathe or see anything else.  The demon rode the waves of pain and was the only illumination in the darkness.  Weeks?  I'd lost track of any amount of time.  I watched the demon's eyes get clearer, watched as the tentacles grew shape and formed and raked my body in places it never had.  The pain made me want to scream out but my mouth was dry and raw and no sound escaped my throat.

The soft scent of vanilla followed quickly by cinamon rode in on currents of the winds in my mind.  Images drifted in my head along with the floating red eyes and tentacles.  A man with deep blue eyes, his hands touching my face - a soft kiss and my mind went blank.  There was nothing but the soft presence in my soul.  

But it too was replaced by the pain and darkness.  Months?  Years?  There was nothing but pain, the demon crept back in, making hmself known again.  "Mine," it claimed in a rasping voice that tore through my head like a sledgehammer.  "Mine!"

The pain became normal.  The pain waxed and waned on the currents of the air.  For every up there was a down and for every in an out.  It pulsed in me like my heart beat.  

And then when I thought the pain had become nothing more than a dull ache I saw a light. The light called to me, I blinked and my eyes were stunned by the light - it was too bright.  I covered my eyes with my hand, my skin felt cold and clammy and there were wires restricting my movment.  My heart started to race.  Panic flooded my body and I tried to sit up but pain lanced through my body.  Instruments of fleshy heat touched my arms holdng me down.  Sounds like words never touched my ears.  I wanted to scream but I couldn't.

A soft rush under my skin and then there was darkness.  And in the darkness the demon returned.  "It's about time."  And the demon shown his face, his eyes no longer read.  The world had solidified in my mind and I knew the man in front of me.  He worse a smile that I hated, his eyes gleamed with a dark lust.  He touched my skin and I felt the hfire burn my skin.  

My eyes shot open and I was looking up at the man.  He smiled down at me and laughed.  "You are mine!"

I couldn't speak, I couldn't think as I drifted back into nothingness.  The dull ache of pain left and was comforted by the soft touch against my hand.  A familiar voice spoke to me but the words didn't reach me.  I moved towards the voice.  I tried to open my eyes but the tender touch covered them.  "Don't move, Nox."

I grabbed the wrist holding my eyes close and tried to push it away.  But it was unmovable. The grip moved from gently touching me to pinning my wrists above my head.  I felt a hot breath against my neck as the voice whispered in my ear.  "Nox.  It's okay don't move.  Keep your eyes closed and don't move and I'll let you go.  They will restrain you if they come in here and you are like this.  Lie still. Please."

I did as I was instructed unsure of why I complied.  Lips brushed my ear in a gentle kiss.  "Good.  Listen to me."

I relaxed more and I felt the presense leave.  I heard a chair scraping against the floor and smelled vanilla and cinamon.  I knew it meant something but my brain was foggy and I was barely managing the little control I had.  "You've been hurt badly."  I felt his hand touch mine.  It was warm and soft in my hand.  It hurt to move.  I groaned.  The sound of my own voice sounded foreign - strained.

"Shhhh... Don't move."  I tried to open my eyes, but his hand touched my eyes.  "Just stay still, quiet and don't open your eyes.  Please?  Let me talk."  His hand slid down my face and caressed it I leaned my head into it.  I heard him smile.  "Touch, is what you want?  I can do that.  Just no more moving.  You jumped off the roof Nox.  You almost died.  You broken nearly every bone in your body. They almost lost you a few times, but your body started rapidly healing, and then stopped and would start again.  You've been trashing around and making things worse."

"You told me I could share my energy to help before.  You never showed me how."  He sounded sad.

A wave of images flahsed through my mind.  Sitting in a hospital room flirtig with Dorian.  Dorian... I thought about the patterns in my head that I had wanted to show Dorian and I wove them weakly from memory.  I heard Dorian gasp as saw what I was doing.  He put his hand on my chest and tried to make me stop.  "Nox.  Stop.  You are too weak."

I tried to speak but my voice only cracked.  I kept trying.  "You. to help."

I could feel my energy depleting.  I felt the fog settle over my mind as I drifted yet again off into oblivion.

There was pain, worse than before but the demon didn't come, there was only he soft scent of vanilla and cinamon and images of Dorian floating through my mind.  His deep blue eyes staring back at me.  

I opened my eyes, the room was dim and I could hear the soft beeping of machines nearby. My mouth felt dry and I was hungry.  I moved and it hurt but I found the nurse call button and touched it.  There were no voices from the little speaker, but the door to my room opened and she walked over slowly.  "Nox?"

I tried to speak but only one word came out audible. "Hungry."

She smiled at me and laughed.  "Okay.  But it's a liquid diet. "  She picked up a cup and dropped a few ice chips in my mouth, "This should help."

And it did a little.  I tried to sit up and she put her hand on my bare chest, "Stay still I'll raise the bed and then I'll let your doctor know you are awake."

"Dorian?"

She laughed.  "I sent him home to sleep about an hour ago.  After you started improving, I told him he had to sleep in a proper bed."  She smiled.  "I was surprised he left."

I smiled.  "Can I have my phone?"

She shook her head.  "No sorry.  I will call him and tell him you are awake. But your Doctor is first."

I sighed.  "Do I have to keep this thing in my arm?"

"You at least haven't ripped it out yet.  But yes you do.  Let the doctor see you first."

I sighed, "You are luck it hurts to move.  I want to see Dorian."

"He'll be here when he gets here.  You had other visitors too."  

I shrugged.  "Who wouldn't want to come stare at me while I sleep."  

She smiled.  And I asked, "I didn't catch your name last time."

"Shannon."  She smiled brightly, "And you never asked before."

"That is completely my bad."  I started coughing.  

Ana handed me a cup of ice, "No more talking.  No moving.  No nothing until the doctor sees you."  She grinned at me, "Or I won't call Mr. Vega."

I mimed the motion of zipping my lips with a smile and sucked on the ice chips until a familiar face was standing in my doorway. 

Ana stepped in and said, "The first of many doctors who you have to see today.  Behave, or I will keep my promise."

I rolled my eyes and then pointed out my window then stuck my tongue out at her.  Dorian was standing in the hallway leaning against the nurses station speaking to another nurse there, a brunette with a purple streak in her hair that I was pretty sure I knew but at the moment I couldn't place her.  Ana closed the blinds and stuck her tongue out at me and I grinned.  Well played.

Margo closed the door after Ana left.  "How are you feeling Nox?"

"I hurt - everywhere."

Margo sat down in the chair beside the bed.  "That happens when you break every bone in your body."

"Why are you here?"  I asked.

"Evaluating your mental state."

"So they think I jumped to kill myself?"  I sighed.  It wasn't the first time that they'd tried to keep me from the roof by claiming I was trying to kill myself.

"That's their angle."  But Margo didn't sound convinced.

"I'm not entirely sure they are wrong, Nox."

"Seriously?  You think I'd kill myself?"

Margo sighed. "It's not like you've not tried in the past."

"I was seven."

"And again at 14."

I was angry.  "I didn't try to kill myself when I was 14.  It was a fucking accident.  I thought you beleived me when I told you that."

Margo sighed.  "I reserved judgment Nox.  You jumped from the building and you almost killed yourself, landing on the cement sidewalk instead of the grass you claimed to be aiming for."

"I was messing around.  I was playing with patterns.  I only got bumps and bruises and broken arm from the bad landing."

"And this time?"  Margo asked.  "Were you saving the boy like Dorian?"

I shook my head and it hurt.  "No.  He jumped I was trying to catch him.  He was the one setting off bombs."

"And you told no one.  No one knows what you and that boy were doing."

"I told Dorian.  I called him.  Told him I knew who it was.  Who had hurt him.  Jace was there."

Margo nodded.  "They both said the same thing, but you didn't tell them who.  Dae'lin says that Dorian believes you are correct based on the puzzle you were putting together together.  But Dorian isn't a hunter Nox."

I sighed.  "No he just has a fucking photographic memory for **everything** he sees.  The puzzle pieces were inverted.  The second one made it click it filled in the tell tale peices that were missing from the first.  Levi showed me that weave.  He created it the testing room for me to see him ability to work with all the elements at the same time."

"So you what?  Chased him to the roof and he jumped.  Why would he do that?"  Margo asked.

"Because he thought he'd get away.  He thought he was better than I was and that I wouldn't follow him but I was the one who showed him how in the first place."  I sighed.  "In hindsight I shouldn't have followed, he was going to die either way.  But I was blinded by anger.  I wanted him to pay for what he'd done.  For hurting Dorian, and Nick and Mrs. Vega."

"I'm sorry Nox.  There will be a formal investigation.  Now that you are up and awake they will move you to the pschye ward for sucide watch until further notice."

I shrugged.  "Whatever.  It's not the first time and I doubt it'll be the last time."

Margo stood up and sighed.  "Nox.  They will take away children if they think you are a risk to their safety."

I growled, "No they won't."

"You really think your childhood was that bad?"

I crossed my arms and frowned.  "I'm done talking since no matter what I say is going to be used against me anyway."

"Nox."  Margo took a step and touched my check with the tips of her fingers.  "You know I beleive you."

"Yeah.  You beleive me but as usual you have too little power."

She sighed.  "Dr. Wilton will be in to see you in a moment.  He will give you the offical ruling and will be your doctor in the interim.  I've been found unreliable."

I asked, "Why?"

Margo looked at me with sadness.  "I've been dating your father for the past three years.  He came to me interested in you, but I couldn't speak to him about you.  We hit it off, and have been seeing each other since."

"It figures.  Why not have my motherly figure fucking my father."

She slapped me hard and I could feel the blooming hand print against my cheek.  "That is uncalled for.  I will forgive you this one - act a child again and you and I will terminate this relationship."

I looked down.  "I'm sorry."

"Really?"

"Yes, ma'am.  I shouldn't have said that.  My anger got the best of me.  I'm not angry at you.  Or my father. Just another thing to deal with."  I rolled over on to my side with my back facing her, "I'd rather be left alone now."

Margo put her hand on my shoulder and I had the urge to jerk it away but I hurt just rolling over so I didn't bother.  "Two more doctors and you can see Dorian."

"Such generoisity."
