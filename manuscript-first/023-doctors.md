## Doctors

Margo left the room and I could feel the tears rolling down my cheeks.  I had been delibrately mean.  I wanted to apologize more than I already had, but she was gone.  A new set of footsteps followed her wake.  I could tell by the smel of his cologne that he was older and male. 

"Mr. Sétanta.  I'm here to discuss things with you, if you can turn and face me."

I complied only so I didn't embarass Margo.  I couldn't imagine the face the man saw I was thankful for the lack of eye make up.  He didn't look like much, his hair was bristly and his eye glasses were thick.  I wondered if he were pretending to be human or if he was really this bad - Venatori with glasses was nearly unheard of.  Possible but very improbable.

"Tell me about yourself."

I frowned, "Really?"  He nodded and I sighed.  "You know my name and all that stuff.  I'm an improbable Minorem Cesari ranked the highest this generation.  I'm reckless and obnoxious and I don't have any friends.  Well that's a lie.  I have one friend."

"And this is what defines you?"

"For the most part."

Dr. Wilton sat down and jotted a few notes and then looked upa at me.  "I have read your files from Dr. Silverman and Ms. Rivera.  I see you have several attempts on your own life.  Can you tell me about the first time?"

"What do you want to know?  You want to know how it felt to take a razor slice of air and run it down my wrists?  Or do you want to know the feeling of the life running out of you before you passed out?  How about how it felt waking up in the hospital strapped to a bed so I wouldn't hurt myself.  Or what about.."

"Tell me why you did it?"  He interrupted.

I sighed and stared up at the ceiling.  "I was depressed.  I was 6.  I had been beaten for a year, my mother left me in the care of my abuser and I had no friends.  Life wasn't worth living anymore.  I was afraid, but I didn't understand what being Venatori meant at the time. I didn't know I couldn't hurt myself fast enough to do permanant damage."
 
"And the second time?"

I rolled my eyes.  "I didn't try to kill myself but the one time.  Margo taught me to value my life after that.  Gave me assignments to deal with my issues.  We stopped talking about what happened with my teacher and started dealing with my mental health.  It helped.  Knowing I was wired differently.  We tried medicine, but I reacted badly to Venatori meds and the human meds didn't work.  So we had to find other mechanisms to cope.  That's when I started jumping."

"Jumping gave me control of my fears.  It gave me hope.  If I could defeat my fear of heights to do that, I could do anything."

"So the second time ..."

"Was an accident.  I jumped.  I was experimenting with different weaves.  The wind caught it unexpectedly and I was carried over the cement and I got bruses and broke my arm."

"What about this time?"

I sighed.  "I was catching a bad guy.  I was doing my job.  It's that simple."

"You weren't authorized to go after this person.  No one knew what you were doing.  That was against protocol."

I shrugged.  "Whatever.  I jumped after him to keep him from running.  He ran when the place went into lockdown.  Tell me why they beleived Dorian enough to shut down, but not that I was chasing him.  But you are just doing your job so just tell me what I need to know and let the next egg head sit here in your seat and do their job so I can go sit in some holding cell twiddling my thumbs."

Dr. Wilton's face light up like a christmas tree with reds and blues.  He vein pulsed.  I was tired of being nice.  "You are here-by reprimanded to suicide watch until the investigation of this negligence is finalized."

He stood up and swung the door open and it smashed against the wall.  He stammered at the nurses.  "I'd sedate him before he's seen by another."  And he walked off down the hall I hoped I didn't have to see him again, but Margo wasn't to be my counsel on this one.

The third doctor stepped inside her green eyes sparkled and the patterns around her swirled and swayed and I had to look away.  I couldn't make myself stop seeing her patterns she was so uncontrolled.  I had never seen anyone with that much lack of control even a child who was first coming into their power.

"Mr. Sétanta.  I am Dr. Amara Eriksen.  I'd like to ask you about what Mr. Vega did."

"I don't know what you are talking about.  I have been unconscious for a while now.  No one's even told me."  I stated flatly.

"While you were unconscious you were nearly dead.  You started healing, stopped and would start again.  Until Mr. Vega came in here and spoke to you.  You were lucid for a few moments we have it on video.  But nothing came through."

"What did I say?"

She sat down.  "Dorian said you had wanted to show him how to share energy."

I smiled.  "Did I say anything?"

She nodded.  "You.  To hep."

"I must have showed him how to feed me resources to help my body heal."

"Can you explain that?"

I shook my head.  "Not right now.  I'm starving. And I'd like to see my ...."  I smiled.  "I'd like to see Dorian." I had wanted to say boyfriend, but I don't think Dorian would appreciate that sentiment yet.

"I will be stuck in a holding cell until futher notice, and you can ask me all the questions you like.  Until I see Dorian, and eat for a few days I will not speak to anyone else."  I closed my eyes and leaned back against the pillow.

"So that's it?"  She asked.

I didn't answer I was quiet in the darkness behind my eyes.  I was going to stand my resolve.  She sighed and left the room.  The door was almost closed when Dorian stepped inside with a frown on his face.  "Nox you have to talk to these people."

"No I don't.  I have days or weeks to talk to them.  But I wanted to see you."

Dorian smiled.  "They are monitoring everything in here."

I nodded.  "I'll behave.  I can barely move anyway."

Dorian chuckled.  "Good to know.  But watch what you say as well."  He sat down on the edge of the bed and touched my cheek.  "You need to shave."

I ran my fingers over my chin and thought I did as well.  "How long have I been out?"

"Almost two months."  Dorian said flatly.  "Most of it you were thrashing around and they had to tie you down.  Until you showed me what to do.  I didn't get it at first but then you passed out and I could only try."

I smiled.  "Thank you.  We are probably even now."

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  That only counts as one.  You've saved me twice. And if we get technical you saved my mother and I owe you for that too."

"Fine, but at least it's closer now."  I grined at him.  "I'm hungry."

"I placed an order and you should have food soon."  Dorian ran his fingers through my hair, "Your roots are showing too."

I laughed.  "Do I need to freshen up after my two months of sleep?"

Dorian smiled. "I don't mind.  But you shouldn't be shaving.  I can help if you'd like."

"I'd like."  I grinned at him.  "We can leave the color out though if you'd prefer."

Dorian ran his fingers through my hair again.  "I told you I like the color."

The door opened and a tray of food came in with an orderly.  He smiled at Dorian and when Dorian was taking the tray from him the orderly was checking him out.  I winked at the orderly as he left and smiled.  Dorian was busy with the food as the orderly left.  I grinned at him.  "He was checking you out."

Dorian sighed.  "That's been happening a lot these past two months.  Openly involved with a man seems to bring them out of the woodwork.  With the females too it seems.  I've had three propositions."

I picked up a peice of chicken with my fingers and popped it in my mount.  Dorian handed me a fork.  "You have no manners."

I stuck my tongue out at him.  He leaned in and kissed my cheek.  "Eat."

I ate as instructed while Dorian rummaged through another bag sitting in a corner.  "You weren't very nice to Dr. Silverman earlier."

"You saw that?"  I asked through mouthfuls but I didn't look at Dorian.  I didn't want to see his expression.

"Yes."

"I shouldn't have said it.  I don't have a problem with Margo with my father.  I hate that they use it against her."

Dorian put his hand on my shoulder.  "She knows.  At least that's what she said.  She said you'd feel bad, she said don't be surprised when he gets all mushy about it."

"I don't get mushy."  I grinned.

"That's what she said."  Dorian sat down on the bed next to me with shaving cream and a straight razor setting on the table.  He just watched me eat.

"So you really are going to help?"  I nodded toward his little kit. "And the old fashioned way."

He nodded.  "It's been a while since I've shaved another face, but yes."

I swallowed the last of what I had been eating.  "Are just going to stare at me whileI eat, or would you like me to stop.  I could be a while otherwise."

He grinned. "I don't mind. My day is clear."

"Clear?  Why did you clear your day?  You have kids to take care of."

Dorian smiled.  "I have you to take care of.  When I found out Jace was the only one coming to see you I came more often.  Your father has been here, but he's been out in the field with my father more often.  Nurse Morganstern says he doesn't stay long, and he didn't like watching you thrashing around.  She also said the only time you were ever calm was when I was here."

I smiled and looked down trying to look like I was busying myself with looking for the napikin I had dropped.  I knew why that was.  I'm not sure Dorian did.  He put his fingers under my chin and made my eyes meet his.  "It's alright."  He smiled and starte lathering the shaving cream in his hands and dabbing it against my skin.  It was cold, but his hands were warm I closed my eyes and rested while Dorian worked.  "I could shave it all off."

My eyes bolted open and he was grinning at me.  "I take it you don't want that."

"Preferably not."

Dorian smiled.  "I'll be careful."

I closed my eyes again as Dorian sharpened the blade on the leather strap, the sound was not comforting but I tried not to panic.  I trusted Dorian - I trusted him with my life.  I counted down from ten to try and calm my anxiety.  Dorian caught on to my anxiety and started humming the song my Nanny had sung to me as a child.  The razor touced my neck and the cold steel sent shivers down my spin.  I was really going to let him do this.  Dorian worked with percision.  "I found the name of the song.  Though the lyrics were in Draconic I'm not surprised you don't remember the words."

"What's the name?"  I managed to get out after three attempts.

"Sleep little dragon is what it translates to.  I can't speak draconic."

I tried not to move but it made me smile.  Dorian was careful.  He even used scisors to trim what he had left of my goatee and mustashe.  By the time he was wiping my face clean I had dozed several times.  I was completely woken up when Dorian stood up.  I opened my eyes and frowned.  "Not going anywhere,"  he said.  "Just putting things away.  You should sleep though."

"I'll have plenty of time to sleep over the next little while."

Dorian frowned.  "Sorry about that.  I wished they'd beleive me but aparently I'm not quite as impartial as they'd like."

"Because we've kissed."

Dorian shook his head.  "No.  I doubt they care about that.  The first day I gave them an ear full about how they needed to help you.  I cited a few Clandestine laws at them.  After you started getting a little better I gave them another and asked them why they stopped helping before I realized that you'd just run out of your own resources."  Dorian sighed.  "I started looking through your laptop in hopes that I'd find something on what you did to me.  But you didn't seem to have anything.  Someone wasn't happy I had been borrowing your laptop and reported it.  Theft is not looked highly upon, and since you were in a coma I couldn't exactly get you to say I hadn't been stealing it."

"I gave you the password.  I wouldn't have cared."

Dorian nodded.  "Thanks but it took some of my credibility away.  Ruining my image in all sorts of ways for you."

I frowned despite the smile that played on Dorian's face.  "Move over."  Then he looked at me a little closer, "Can you move over?"

I nodded and moved slowly to one side of the bed.  Dorian laid down on his side next to me draping an arm over my stomach, the added weight hurt a little, but I wasn't about to make him move it.  He settled in next to him his head against the pillow and I leaned in against him.  "I am not ruining anything by the way - my image.  I'm just adding you to it.  Now sleep."

I closed my eyes and leaned my head agaisnt Dorian's chest.  It wasn't quite comfortable but I was soon drifting alone in the darkness the only thing dancing in front of me was images of Dorian.  He hummed softly and I could smell his soft sweet scent and I felt safe as I let oblivion take me into the depths of my own darkness.
