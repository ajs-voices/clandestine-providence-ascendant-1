## A Real Little Boy

We ate breakfast at a McDonald's, that was a first for me.  I let Jo order for me since none of it sounded apetizing at all.  And I had been right, I didn't like it.  

We took a cab to a neighborhood similar to where Gregory lived.  The building we pulled up at was a multilevel building that with the words "apud pack sunt , in superbia , et in aliis coetibus distinctio" engraved above the door.

I asked, "What does that say?"

Elena smiled.  "Residing here are pack, pride, and other groups of distinction."

"The creed of the CCB."

Elena nodded.  "One of our hostles for wayward were's and members who wish to live with their pack, pride or group."  She smiled.  "This is a werewolf hostle, but all are welcome."

Elena lead the way into the building.  The entrance was like that of any multilevel building with apartments.  Except it lead into a very large common room where a tiny little girl played.  Elena interrupted the girl's conversation she was having with someone they couldn't see.  "Celia.  Can you find your mother or father for me.  You have new residents."

Celia looked up at them and she smiled.  She grabbed Jo's hand and dragged her off down one of the halls.  "Momma said I could show her to her room."  Celia then yelled, "Momma, Ms. Elena is here."

Elena was rolling her eyes and I was holding back laughter as woman in a white apron walked out from a room I assumed would be the kitchen.  "Elena.  Where is Jo?"

"Celia took her already."

"Of course she did."  The woman wiped her hands on her apron and offered me here hand.  "My name is Emily Parker and you've met my daughter Celia already.  You must be Nox."

I nodded as I brought her hand to my lips and kissed softly.  "A pleasure."

"Your things arrived last night by courier they are in your room.  Let me show you around."  She turned to Elena, "Charles called.  He said when  you got here to inform you he will be working late tonight.  Entertain yourself."

Elena laughed like it was a normal thing for her husband to blow her off like that.  "It seems I have time to help indoctrinate our newest member."

Emily frowned, "You are optimistic he will stay."

"He will.  I promise you that."  Elena took my arm and started down the hall Jo had moved down with Celia.  She opened the first door in the hall, "This is the communal bedroom."

Emily added.  "There is no sex in this room."

I nodded.  "Figured that since kids live here."  I grinned at Ms. Parker, "I assume you've read my files as well."

She blushed.  "We all have, otherwise you'd have been placed elsewhere."

I smiled.  "I will behave myself."

Elena added.  "And I must say it's a slight disappointment that he does.  I had such high expectations of him."  She smiled at me with a seductive look.

Emily kept moving and ignored the conversation but I could see the rose color at the base of her neck and ears.  "The library is here and across from it is the game room."

A pair of stairs let up, "That is to the girls dorms."

We went back towards the living area.  "The kitchen."  Emily pointed and I stepped inside the kitchen despite the fact that Emily had moved on.  Both of the women stepped inside as I was running my hand over the stainless steel stove top.  

I smiled.  "Can anyone use it?"

"Of course.  We have family meals prepared for all meals, and left overs are always saved."

"Can I cook? I mean."

"You cook?"  Emily asked.  The shock in her voice was something I was used to.

"Since I was 10."

She nodded, "Of course.  But if you cook you need to make enough for everyone."

"Not a problem."

I looked up and saw Elena happily grinning at me.  I gave her a smile that said I was awesome.

She laughed.  

"This way."  She pointed down another hall way that joined with the one she'd been moving too.  "This is the class rooms here.  And up there, is the boys dorms.  Where you will be."

"In the entrance is the stairs up to the family dwellings, multiple conjoined rooms for families like mine."  She pointed to the stairs.  "Shall we?"

I followed Emily up three flights of very unsteady stairs that were probably worse than taking any elevator.  My heart was racing by the time we had climbed to the top floor.  "The second door on the right is yours."

There was a key in the door and she turned it and pushed it open handing me the key afterwards.  My things were on the bed.  It looked like a college dorm room.  The bed wasn't very big, there was a desk and a dresser.  I asked, "And are there any rules?"

"What do you mean?"  Emily asked.

"House rules.  Curfew?  No boys in the girl dorms? things like that?" I asked.

She shook her head.  "If you cook, cook enough for everyone.  Clean up after yoursef.  Treat everyone with respect, we are all pack."

"You can come and go as you please. The key is also a key to the house.  We have a communal car if you need it.  There are computers in the game room."

Elena glanced at her phone that was silently buzzing in her hand.  She smiled.  "Darlings I must be going.  Nox.  I'd like a home cooked meal tonight."

"Yes ma'am 8pm sound good?"

"Of course."  Elena turned to Emily.  "Auto is waiting for him."

Emily nodded.  "I will take him there immediately."

Elena left my room with a princess wave and was down the stairs before Emily and I got into the hall way.  "Who's Auto?"

Emily laughed.  "Ironically he's our mechanic.  You will be working for him.  He's getting up there in age and a young strapping man like yourself even with no experience will be a great amount of help.  And he'll teach you a thing or two."

"I look forward to it."  I was starting to feel like a real little boy - I wondered if Pinocchio felt like this when he was turned into flesh.
