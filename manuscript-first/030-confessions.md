## Confessions

My days in the ward drew closer together, I forgot from one day to the next what day of the week it was.  Everything was perfectly scheduled, it was probably the most at peace I'd been in the past ten years.  I knew exactly where I was supposed to be and when.  

I had lunch daily with Dorian and sparred every other with my father.  I met with Margo once a week, and Dr. Wilton everyday for 30 minutes or so.  I even met with Dr. Eriksen about things she wanted to know about - mostly me and how was doing, but she asked some very weird questions.  Things like how I was feeling that day, if I felt sorer than usual even though I'd been doing better.  Dorian had even stopped giving me his energy.  Of course it had been at my prompting.  I could touch my ability again and do drips and drabs to continue the healing process.

I hung out more with Jo and Lori than with anyone else at our table.  I think Cliff was stepping back because he had a crush on me and Duke was afraid I had a crush on him.  Neither of them really paying any attention to the fact that I was completely smitten with Dorian.  So much so that both Lori and Jo commented on it nearly everyday.

I also had a few conversations with women who supposedly wanted Cesari children.  Anabel Dowager had come one day handing me a slip of paper with scheduled times over the past few months.  She said we'd plan specifics once I was released.  She also informed me that her mother was pushing for a much earlier release.  Which I wasn't going to argue for.  The more people on my side the better my chances of getting out of this joint were.

The large girl from the cafeteria had also come to see me, her name was Amanda Brighton and she did want what everyone else wanted.  I turned her down, but not because of her looks because she expected that I would enjoy a foul mouth on a woman.  I don't mind dirty talk in the bedroom but before we get there it's a bit much.  I think my reputation had preceded me with her.  I didn't remember her being part of my crowd, but then very people were ever part of my crowd.  Though the rumors were always pretty bad anyway.

Today I had a meeting with Dr. Eriksen about my health.  I wasn't looking forward to it.  After than I hoped I could get Margo to get me out of here, but she wasn't officially my pschyologist at the moment so I'd requested Dr. Wilton's presence as well.  

My meetings with the docotors were after lunch and I was looking forward to spending time with Dorian.  He'd come everyday for the past few weeks as I sat in this place doing absolutely nothing.  He always gave me something to draw while he was gone, so I had a notebook full of things I'd drawn at his request along with my recurring nightmares.

Dorian sat at my little desk flipping through the latest drawings and back to other drawings he'd asked me to draw.  I could see the wheels turning as he searched through the pages for something.  I was tired of him being so far away so I went to him and put my hands on his shoulders and looked over his head at what he was looking for.  There was a momentary stiffening as I touched him, but he relaxed into my hands quickly enough.  This was still a very public location for Dorian even though it was currently my bedroom.

Dorian flipped between two drawings, one more recent than the other and back to one I'd done earlier in the week.  He asked, "These aren't the same, but they feel the same."  He commented.

I took the notebook from him and carefully cut both pages out and laid them down on the desk for him to compare.  He looked up at me like I'd ruined something.  I grinned at him.  "I can fix it."

I put them back in their places and essentiall glued them back together with fibers made from my own creation.  He shook his head.  "Do you use your abiltiy for everything?"

I nodded and winked at him, "Not everything.  Though that could be interesting.  A few extra hands and appendages could come in useful."

Dorian blushed knowing exactly what I was talking about.  I handed him the papers again and he set them down and examined them.  "These?  What are they?"

Dorian pointed at the shining stars between the patterns.  "Life."  I said simply.  

"That's how you see it?"

I nodded.  "If I look close enough, yes."

He blinked at me and then wove a pattern of pure air in front of him and I could tell he was focusing hard on the pattern.  "It's always there?"

"Always."

Dorian sat there staring at his own creation until a slow smiled spread on his face.  "But you can't manipulate it?"

He looked up at me with curiousity and eagerness.  He enjoyed learning new things, and this he was in heaven.  He'd asked me the same questions over and over again but he never quite beleived.  I nodded at him. "You cannot manipulate life."

He sat studing different weaves he could create, he was becoming rather adept at it without any formal training.  I wondered if he tried to test himself in the wee hours of the night when no one was in the testing rooms.  I doubted Dorian really cared for all his research into things.  I kneeded his shoulders as they grew tense with concentration.  I felt him relax into my fingers and groan softly as I worked the knots in his shoulders.  

Dorian grabbed a hand and pulled me around in front of him and down into his lap.  I sat in stunned silence as his fingers played with the belto loops of my jeans.  I looked down at him bitting my bottom lip wondering what he had in mind.  I could feel his body react to being this close to me and I responded in kind.  We still hadn't done more than pretend we were teenagers making out on my bed - all hands and lips over skin and not much below the belt.  And I really didn't expect more with cameras in the room.  But that didn't stop my body from wanting so much more.

"Don't do that."  Dorian's hand rose from my hip to my lip and ran his finger over my bottom lip until I released it.  

I leaned forward and pressed my forehead to his and whispered, "But you like it."

Dorian pulled my chin down and kissed me deeply as he stood up.  I gasped into his mouth and I had little time to protest the maneuver as he carried me with Venatori speed to the bed and had me lying on my back with his body over mine.  I didn't have time to fight the panic attack before Dorian's mouth envolped my entire consioucness.  There was nothing but he and I.

And as always when we got going, hands and lips someone opened the door with a studdering, "Oh, I'm sorry."

Dorian looked up and rolled his eyes.  "It's not like it's the first time Madison dear.  You've walked in on everyday this week." Dorian was sitting up and straightening his shirt that I'd pulled out of his pants to get to his skin underneath.  "I suppose that means Dr. Silverman is here with Dr. Wilton?"

Madison nodded, "They are early."

Dorian leaned over and kissed me fully on the lips and pulled away breathless then whispered, "Dream about me tonight."  He got up and headed for the door.  He smiled at Madison, "We should start charging."

Madison blushed as Dorian walked out the door closing slowly behind him.

I didn't bother with straigthening myself as Dorian had.  I didn't really care what Margo or Leroy saw.  Madison walked beside me to the small room used for pshcye consults.  She stopped at the door and smiled, "He's more braizen each day."

I laughed, "I think it's more to do with need rather than actually changing."

"Meaning?"

I leaned over and whispered to Madison, "He wants me that bad.  And he knows it's mutual and we've yet to actually **do** anything about it."

She blushed as I opened the door.  "Knock next time."

Madison nodded and I entered the small room where my two lovely therapist sat.

Margo sat in a folding chair while Dr. Wilton sat in the plush one leaving me with the stupid couch.  I hated the couch.  I sat down and smiled at my long time therapist.  "How goes it?"

She smiled at me as she always did.  "I'm fine.  Did we interrupt something?"

I grinned at her.  "I don't kiss and tell."

Dr. Wilton cleared his throat.  "You know that is a lie.  In saying it you imply what you were doing."

"If you are implying we were kissing I will say yes to that.  But if you want more details too bad."

The man pushed his glasses up as they slid down his pointed little nose.  "And if it were part of your recovery you'd be required to tell me, but your love affair with Mr. Vega is not any of our business.  Shall we?"

I sighed.  "Fine.  What is on today's agenda?  Am I still suidical?  Nope.  Am I going to jump off building for the hell of it?  Yep.  Am I trying to kill mysel? Nope.  And anything I'm leaving out?"

Dr. Wilton jotted down my answers and sighed.  "Why do you insist on jumping from the building?"

"Because I can.  Because it feels good to fall for those 8 seconds it takes me.  I trust my ability."

"But you just recently got that power back after taxing yourself too hard.  It could fail you in the middle of the jump."  He honestly sounded concerned for my well being.

"And do you not drive a car because it could blow up any second?  Or fly in a plane because it will crash into the ocean drowning you?  Do you stop eating because you could choke on your unchewed bite or swallow a bone that could peirce through your larnyx?  No you don't because the probability is slim and you trust in it.  I trust my ability.  I trust myself implicity.  I will not jump if I feel weak.  I will not use my ability unless I know I can fully function.  I am not an idiot.  I value my life more than I value most things."

Margo whispered, "Except maybe Dorian's life."

I grinned at her.  "Yes.  I value Dorian's life above my own.  I would do anything to keep him alive.  Anything!"

Dr. Wilton.  "Mr. Setanta..."

The door opened and Dr. Eriksen poked her strawberry blonde head into the room.  "I'd like to speak to all of you together if I might."

Dr. Wilton waved her in and gave her the cushy chair and unfolded another folding chair in the corner.  The room just got a whole lot smaller with little miss doctor with chaotic patterns.

The doctor sat down and I averted my eyes from her I felt like I was going to vomit her pattern was chaotic and I could not make it go away because it was too strong.

"You're healing power is exemplary Mr. Setanta."  Dr. Eriksen said as if it were something she was proud of.

"Nox.  And I didn't do most of it."

"Then who did?"

I shrugged.  

"Who did Nox?"  She repeated herself.  I didn't answer.  I kept looking at the floor.  "Why won't you look at me?"

I grinned.  "Because you make me sick." 

The room grew quiet and I laughed.  "What I mean to say is.  The pattern around you makes me sick to my stomach.  I can't look at you without seeing it."

"I am not Magnus."  She sounded like she believed what she said.

"Whatever you say Duckling.  You are untrained and Eruditus, but you are Cesari."

Margo leaned forward, "Cesari can never be learned, Nox."

"Why not?  Dorian is close, I feel it.  I see it."  I nodded towards Dr. Eriksen, "And she is one.  There is no doubt in my mind."

"And by the way if you hadn't figure it out yet, Dorian is the one who helped me heal fast.  Until recently touching the elements has been rather painful for me.  Without Dorian I would still be in need of a bed and a wheelchair."  I kept my eyes averted the whole time we'd been speaking.  I could tell Margo was annoyed.

Dr. Wilton made a suggestion, "Can you help her with the chaotic pattern then?"

I shrugged, "If she's willing to try."

I made four balls of elements above my hands.  "Draw a colored line in  your mind from you to the ball.  You have to see it in  your head, not just say it's done.  You have to beleive it's done."

I watched from hooded eyelids and saw that her pattern was calming down.  I turned my face up to look at her directly and smiled.  "See was that hard?"

Dr. Eriksen frowned, "That could have all be a ploy."

I shrugged, "Whatever.  I don't typically lie inside these walls."

Margo nodded her agreement, "He's right, he may not give you the full truth, but he rarely lies.

I didn't care what she thought.  I rarely cared what anyone else thought anyway, why should this woman be any different.  I looked at her with indifference.  "You wanted to tell us something."

She nodded.  "I have a confession to make.  There were multiple reasons you have been placed here.  You are a danger to yourself, but we needed more time to explain what happened to you."

Dr. Eriksen took out her notes.  "When you first came to me you were on the verge of dying, every bone broken, internal injuries so severe we didn't want to operate.  But with in days you were better.  Still in a coma, but you were healing impossible wounds."

I just stared at her waiting for the ball to drop, there was some sort of catch.

There was a slight flush in the woman before me as she continued.  "The pills you have been taking have been a very specific poison."

Dr. Wilton stared at her with a slack jaw and I could see Margo ready to say something.  I stood up and reached for the door then looked at Margo.  "You will get me out of here, now."  I turned to the woman before me.  "If you don't allow Margo to sign me out of here, I will leave.  And there is nothing you can do to stop me.  I am not some guinea pig you can run experiments on.  I will see your liscense abolished."

I opened the door and slammed it behind me.  I heard a painting crash to the floor but I didn't stop walking.
