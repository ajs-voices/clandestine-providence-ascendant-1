## A Quicky

Both Elena and Isabel were talking loudly in the office when I entered.  They both turned to see who had interrupted their discussion and they both relaxed visibly.  "Nox you aren't going to do something stupid are you?"  Elena asked.

"Yes, Elena I am.  But I have questions first.  You can answer them."

"Nox..."

I interrupted Elena, "Duckling, look I have to do this.  No one else can."

It was Isabel who spoke next, "Nox, you can't do this.  You'll leave us to the wolves almost literally."

"No I won't.  You are strong."  I turned to Elena.  "If the Alpha dies, his mate takes the throne until a new Alpha is made yes?"

Elena nodded.  "Made isn't the right term, but yes, a male can step in and kill the mate taking the power.  Which is usually what happens."  She paused, "But you are unmated Nox."

"Am I?"

Elena looked to Isabel and then back to me.  "Darling, she can't possibly stand up to the people who hate you."

"She can and she will.  I will see to it."

Isabel asked, "How?"

I smiled.  "By getting Il Cane to stand beside you."

Elena gasped, "You can't let vampires get involved in pack business."

"I can and I did. If it means that Isabel holds the pack until she finds a suitable mate to pass the pack to.  Isabel is strong of her own violition, with Cari beside her no one will hurt the pack, not even James not unless he wishes war with the Vampires and the remaining Venatori."

Isabel sighed, "He's already decided Elena.  You will not sway him."

Elena nodded, "Then there is only one thing left to do."

I knelt down on one knee in front of Isable.  "Isabel Reyes, will you marry me?"  I held a jet black ring on my palm.

She took it between two fingers and looked at it cautiously, "You made this didn't you?"

I grinned, "But of course. I was in a hurry."

"It's perfect.  Yes.  Nox.  I'll be your wife."  She slipped the ring on her finger and kissed me.  She turned to Elena as she pulled me to my feet.  "Marry us."

Elena nodded and the door opened to the office and Raf and Jo stepped inside.  "Nox..."

I winked.  "They are tightly bound.  They are easy to call.  They will keep the secret Elena.  Can you?"

Elena nodded.  "You are my creation, I will support you even if it means going against Charles."

"I'm not choosing sides Elena.  I'm taking over."

Elena nodded.  "I know."  There was saddness in her voice, but she of all people understood the ways of the pack.  

The ceremony was supposed to take place under the full moon, but we'd deal with the complications of the magic.  Elena prepared the office space with my help.  There were elements that she needed that I could create.  She was surprised by my knowledge of natural things.  Dead I could create - living was not a possiblity.

At midnight the simple ceremony of ancient magic no one really understood except the priestess of the packs of which Elena was.  There were no words to be spoken - a sharing of blood and meat and we were one.  I could feel the bond between us stronger than before.  

Elena smiled.  "The pack will not be happy to be left out of this, but after you do what you need to do Nox.  You will do this properly."

"Yes ma'am.  A large party and everything - running naked in the woods if I must."

Isabel laughed, "I bet he'd even like that."

I stuck my tongue out at her and she smiled.  Elena nodded.  "It is my pleasure to know you Nox.  And even a greater pleasure to stand by your side."

Isabel and I were given privacy which we took advantage of the newly formed bond. The magic involved in the mating ceremony lingered with us and a child would take root, or so the legend said.
