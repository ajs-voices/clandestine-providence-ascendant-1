## Direct Course of Action

Isabel kissed my check and I followed James into what had become my office after Paul's passing.  It was the pack leader's office but it remained very much Paul's for the moment.

James sat in the comfortable office chair and looked up at me as I sat on the edge of the desk not exactly giving him the height advantage he wanted.  He frowned at me.  "You still rebel at our ways."

I smiled at him.  "That surprises you?"

He shook his head.  "No.  You defer when necessary.  Otherwise you are as cocky as the man outside."

"I'm not stupid enough to challenge you James.  I could beat you in a fight I don't doubt that, and neither do you, but I don't think the CCB as a whole would take to my winning that way and I would be assassinated.  And I really don't want your job.  I'm having difficulting be the leader of one pack, I can't imagine the trouble of being the leader of all the packs and then some."

"A smart boy."  James smiled.  "You are keenly aware of the Venatori buildings and of the Venatori's treatment of our kind."  James emphasised our as he included me in the statement.  It was rare that I was lumped into them like that even by James who had pulled me in this direction.  "The snake must die for the rest of us to die.  If they were leaderless would the snake die."

I shook my head.  "No someone would step up to lead them in even more hatred for the supernatural.  My father called me traitor for stopping a war.  Killing Mark Green will be like killing the Hydra by cutting off a head. You will only make it more aggressive."

James nodded.  "Charles agrees with you.  I'm inclined to beleive it then."

"Charles hates the Venatori for personal reasons.  He doesn't see clearly on it.  But he is correct in this.  The Venatori will unite against anyone who comes against it."

"Who's side do you stand Nox Setanta?" James asked.

"On the side of those I care about."

James laughed, "And that is smack dab in the middle isn't it?"

I nodded.  "It always will be.  Dorian, Jace... Margo and even my father will always tie me to them despite what they are.  I cannot choose a side in this."

"I am forcing your hand Nox."  James tapped his watch, "In one days time, exactly to the hour, a bomb will go off at the sublevels of the Apex Unlimited building it - leveling it to the ground.  I will not tell you where they are or when they will be placed only that they will.  You have a choice to make.  Make the wrong one and your pack with suffer."

James didn't wait for me to respond he walked out of my office and out of the house with less ceremony than he'd come in.  I sat in silence until Isabel came in, "What's wrong?"

I shook my head.  "Nothing you can help me with."

Isabel shut the door behind her.  "Tell me."

I looked at her with her big brown eyes showing all the concern in the world.  "The CCB plans to wipe out the Venatori."

"That's not news."

I added softly, "Tomorrow night.  They plan to bring their home down on top of them."

Isabel frowned.  "This has to be a game.  To test your loyalty.  James wouldn't kill an entire people.  We are not the Venatori."

"Survival of the fittest.  It's the law of the CCB.  The very law of nature itself.  He will and I have no doubt about it.  But you are still right, it is a test."

"What are you going to do?"

"What is right."

"What's that Nox?"  She asked as I was getting up to leave.

"It's better if you don't know what I plan to do Isabel."  I took her chin in my hand and I kissed her softly.  "I love you, but you can't come with me."

"You will order me if I come won't you."

I nodded.  "Please don't make me."

She nodded and I turned to leave.  "Nox..."  I turned back to her a few steps away.  "Don't leave us to die at his hands."

I smiled.  "Never."

I went to my room and I pulled out a card I'd saved for Asher.  We'd been communicating through messages at the donation center I frequented on his behalf, but he'd left me an emergency contact.  I sent him a text.  [i]CCB plans to blow the building up.  I will stop it, but just in case I fail evacuate by tomorrow night.[/i]

I texted Ant.  [i]Make Dorian leave the AU building.  Take him and his family far away.  Tell Jace to stay home.[/i]

When I opened my bedroom door Isabel was standing outside getting ready to knock.  I grinned at her.  "I'm not going anywhere."

She smiled.  "I was afraid you would run to tell them."

I waved my phone.  "They can take care of themselves.  We need to speak to Elena."

"She's down stairs."

"Bring her to my office.  I'll be there in a few moments."

I knew what I had to do, and I would save both families if I could.  But I would at least die trying.  I sent one last text before heading to the office where the two women would meet me.
