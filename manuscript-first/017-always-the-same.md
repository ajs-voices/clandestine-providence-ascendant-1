## Always the Same

Dorian's lips pressed against mine.  I could feel his body pressed against me.  His teeth grazed my lips and our tongues entwined.  Time fled me as I was embraced in the warmth and comfort of that kiss unable to do anything else not that I wanted to anyway.  Dorian pulled away and pressed his forehead against mine and I stared into his deep blue eyes - my heart racing for all the right reasons for a change.  Dorian whispered, "I wanted to do that then."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Why didn't you?  I would have been receptive."

Dorian kissed me tenderly, "You know why."

I laughed.  His friends had dragged him away before we could do more than look at each other.  I was flying from the jump and from the kiss.  "I'm hungry again."

Dorian shook his head.  "This time I think we can work."

I nodded, "If you insist."

Dorian kissed me one last time, bitting my bottom lip as he pulled away.  I let slip a soft moan and he chuckled at me.  "You are easy to tease."

"You are good at it."  I stepped away from the wall and Dorian joined me as we started up the stairs.  We walked the entire way to the common area.  Dorian was winded - I was to a degree, but I was used to hiking in the thin air of the Rocky Mountains for days on end, this was nothing.  

"We didn't have to walk the whole way."

Dorian smiled.  "I know.  I have to keep up somehow."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Oh really?  I can think of a few activities that could increatese your endurance."

Dorian turned that great shade of rose as we opened the landing door and stepped into the hallway and started for the cafeteria.  Dorian took my hand in his and I looked at him with surprise.  He was growing more braizen by the minute.  I was loving it.  I didn't like to hide who I was, and Dorian was fitting into my image and falling so far out of his.  I stopped and Dorian had to drop my hand or he'd have yanked both our arms.  "What's wrong?" he asked.

"Are you doing this for me?  Or because you want to?"

Dorian frowned, "Doing what?"

"Being open about this.  Holding my hand.  Your arm around me.  Even kissing me where people could see.  Is it because you think I want it?"

"No."  Dorian smiled at me.  "Am I doing it because it's you - yes.  But not because I think it's what you want."  He closed the distance and his blue eyes sparkled as I looked into them.  "I do this because I want to.  You don't care what others think.  Let's just say I'm trying to be more like you.  Fuck the image."  Dorian laughed and ran his fingers through my hair.  "I can't pull off what you do, but I can be open about who I am.  I'm trying.  Not because you want me to - because I want to.  I'm a grown man, I don't play childish games."

I grinned at Dorian.  "Good.  I don't want you to change for me.  I like you just the way you are - warts and all."

We laughed and Dorian leaned in and kissed me tenderly.  I could hear people talking about us and hoped Dorian didn't but the tension in his hands told me otherwise.  I bit his bottom lip gently and he pulled away staring at me.  "What was that for?"

"To bring you back to me and not listen to them."  I whispered.

"Thank you." Dorian wrapped his arm around my waist and we walked into the cafeteria with a gaggle of teenage girls giggling behind us.   Things never changed around here.  Dorian glanced back at the girls and they squealed a little before scampering off like the rugrats that they were.

The line in the cafetria was long.  It was later than I thought it was.  We'd spent a great deal of time togeth today - Dorian and I.  I don't think I'd ever done that with anyone other than Jace.

The girls that had been following us were standing in line just in front of us.  They giggled when they saw us standing behind them.  I did not miss teenage girls.  One of the girls couldn't stop staring at me.  I ran my fingers through my hair and grinned at her.  I asked her, "Yes?"

She blushed and looked away but her gaze quickly returned.  She took a step towards us.  "You are the one that just jumped, aren't you?"

I nodded.  "I am.  Why?"

"The whole class thought we were under attack."

"Attack with a light show?"  I snickered.  "I take it they aren't very bright."

She giggled and offered me her hand.  "Daniella Rivera."

I took her hand and lifted it to my lips with a kiss.  "Nox.  I know your aunt."

She nodded. "I know.  She use to complain about you when I was little. He's such a terror.  Why can't he behave.  Why doesn't he act more like X, Y or Z.  On and on."

"Yep that sounds like Dae'lin.  And I remember you though you weren't nothing but an ankle biter then."

Daniella looked at Dorian and then back at me with a flip of her hair to emphasize how long her neck was, she leaned forward and whispered.  "I granduate this year."

I chuckled.  "Congradulations." A small frown played on her lips that were stained a light purple like the skimpy little dress she wore.  Dae'lin would kill her if she saw her in that thing.  

I leaned into Dorian and wrapped my arm around him pulling him close to me.  He hurmphed at the jarring but settled in against me staring off into the crowded cafeteria.  The pout on Daniella's face turned real.  "You really are gay?"


I laughed.  "No.  I'd like you too if you weren't Dae'lin's neice."

Another girl turned around with a fake smile on her face.  "What about me then?"

"Yeah.  Sorry, Duckling.  I've got my hands full right now."  Dorian turned his attention to the two girls and then back at me with a wicked grin on his lips.  I wondered what that was all about.  Dorian dropped his arms from around me and took a step back and leaned against the wall.  He was throwing me to the baby wolves.  "Thanks love."

Dorian stared at me a little stunned at my word choice.  It was sarcasm but I was fairly sure I meant what it implied.

The Daniella's friend moved closer to me.  I looked back to Dorian as she tried to invade my space.  I took a step back.  "Alright.  I know what you've heard.  But Duckling I have a few rules in all those rumors you know about me.  And the first one is I don't ..."  I looked at Dorian and rethought my phrasing.  "I don't do anything with underage persons, I don't do anything with married ones, and I don't like having singler parents for partners on the dance floor."

Dorian was smiling happily behind his hand.  I had passed whatever little test he decided to throw at me.  The girl leaned against me again. "I can give you a better time than he can."  She sneered at Dorian.

I leaned down and whispered so Dorian and Daniella could here.  "Can you now?  You have a cock under that pretty little dress?"

I didn't need to see her hand to know she was going to hit me.  I knew the way her body tensed and I waited for the stinging hand print to make it's impression on my cheek.  I received a second on from Daniella just for good measure I was sure.  The whole gaggle of girls walked off.  I called after them.  "See ya ... ladies."  

I turned back to Dorian who was moving forward in line now that the girls had left the space clear.  "I see nothing changes."

"Sorry."

Dorian pulled me close and I could feel his warmth against my leg.  His hands tenderly ran around the marks that were blossoming red I was sure.  "Not the first time, huh?"

"That I've been slapped?"  I shook my head, "And not likely the last one either."

Dorian leaned in and whispered, "Is that really how you feel about a better time."

I grinned at Dorian.  "You'll just have to wait and see love."

"There is that word again."

"A problem?"  I asked with a calm lift to my voice.  

"No.  Something like your use of duckling?"  Dorian asked.

"Maybe.  Maybe not.  But if it bothers you I'll call you Duckling too."

Dorian laughed as we stepped inside the serving area.  I smiled the moment I got inside and saw Ms. Shiela doling out mashed potatoes and gravy on individual trays.  Her auburn hair was more gray that I remembered it but she still had that motherly look to her.  I poked Dorian with my elbow and nodded towards our server as I said.  "What's a gorgeous dame doing behind some glass partition.  You should be the one being served, not the other way around."

I watched as the fury rose in her cheeks as she was about to spout some anti-sexist remark my way until she saw me and that fury slippied away as fast as the gravy was running down her arm.  "We'll aint you a sight for sore eyes.  I 'eard you was gonna be back."  I loved her souther accent.  Jace hardly ever used his unless his family was around then it came back like riding a bike.  Ms. Sheila never lost hers.

"You waz the one making all that ruckus out there ain't ya?"

I gave her an innocent smile.  "Who me?  Nah.  It was Dorian."

She chortled and nearly dropped her tray.  "That boy ain't got your foolishness about him at all."

I grinned at her and put my arm around him.  "Well, he's got some of it if today's been anythng to say for his foolishness."  I laid a soft kiss against his cheek and he almost hit me.  I felt his arm tense underneath my hand.  I stopped the game and apologized. "Sorry."  I let go of him but he wrapped his arm around me.

"Didja just apologize to the man?"

I nodded.  "Yeah."

Ms. Sheila stepped away shaking her head and headed into the back like she always had when I stepped through her kitchen doors.  Dorian whispered in my ear.  "Don't apologize, Nox."

I turned to look at him.  "I made you uncomfortable. I was out of line."

The girl who was next to Ms. Shiela handed Dorian his tray after he'd decided what he wanted.  The line was being held up and I stepped back to wait on her to get back.  Dorian moved along.  "I'll find us a table." He said before kissing me softly.  "I'll get used to it."

I was grinning madly after Dorian, watching him walk down the rest of the line towards the checkout counter when Ms. Sheila came out carrying a tray.  "I ain't got it all like I used to.  Ya'll gonna be around for while."

I looked back towards the direction Dorian had gone and then back to her.  "That's the plan."

She laughed.  "Maybe ya got more sense then you did as a youngin."

"Doubtful."  I smiled at her with a small bow.  "Thank you ma'am for taking care of me. I don't think I've ever thanked you for that."

Ms. Shiela turned the color her hair used to be.  "Ain't nothin.  Ifin ya want ya'll are welcome to come and cook with me anytime."

I nodded.  "Yes ma'am.  I will."

I made my way to the checkout counter grabbing a bottle of water from the cooler.  I reached for my wallet where my stupid meal card was but the man at the counter smiled and said, "We have you covered for this meal Mr. Sétanta, courtesy of the conference."

"Okay.  Thanks then".  I saw Dorian sitting at a table with others on the end of it.  I took a deep breath and walked towards him.  I could deal with them if they bothered me.  And I expected they would bother me - they always did.

A rather large woman stopped me in the aisle between tables.  "That was quite some show you put on."

I grinned at her trying to remember her name.  Sometimes I wished I had a gift like Dorian and could remember everything at a glance.  But I remembered her.  She had always been larger for a Venatori - our strength and endurance meant that we had high metabolisms - I didn't but full Venatori did.  But she was half human like I was.  "Ren right?  Thanks."

She smiled brightly at being remembered.  "Maybe you can show me how you did it sometime?"

I looked over at Dorian who was watching me with a grin on his face.  Shit!  This fucking progeny thing was going to fucking kill me if I couldn't sit down and eat a meal in peace.  "Maybe.  I need to go.  My boyfriend is waiting for me."

She frowned at my use of words which made me smile inside.  She glanced back where I was looking and Dorian looked down snickering to himself as he sipped at the soda on his tray.  "Boyfriend?  I thought.."

I smiled at her and interrupted, "I do."  I pulled a card out of my wallet that was sitting on my tray.  "Make an appointment.  I'm all sorts of popular these days."  She gave me a happy smile and sat down with her friends.

I made it to Dorian without little more incendent except the people at the end of the table had gone.  So much better.  Dorian looked at me with a grin and reached across my tray and stabbed a carrot with his fork.  "Do you flirt with everyone?"

I smiled.  "I try, Duckling."

He grinned.  "Even the ugly ones?"

There was nothing on Dorian's plate I would touch I stared at it then looked back up at him.  I wished I could eat anything I wanted and look like him... fucking human genes.  I smiled at him to answer his question.  "Especially the ugly ones."

A voice over my shoulder said, "What ugly ones?  You mean you and your _boys_."  I sighed as I recognized the voice as Aaron Woolbright - my former roommate and tormentor.  And also one of the crowd who I was trying to avoid at the end of the table.  

Aaron didn't wait for my answer or my smart remark, he pushed my tray across the table as hard as he could.  The split in the middle caught it and it flew up in the air spilling contents everywhere.  I managed to catch most of it with a weave of air and place it back on the tray on the table where it had carened over.

I stood up and smiled down at the muscular black man who was nearly a foot shorter than I was.  He stared up at me with a glare I recalled from my childhood.   There were lines wrinkling his face in places that were reserved for old me and women who laid out in the sun for most of their lives.

"Hi Aaron.  So glad of you to join us."

I saw Dorian from the corner of my eye, he was pretending to mind his own business like everyone else in the cafeteria.  

Aaron placed his hands on my chest and I wove an wall of air behind me faster than he could push me backwards.  I was immovable, but I could feel his strength pushing into my rib cage. I could feel them cracking under his massive strength but he stopped as I could feel the air leaving my chest.  He always was a punk.  He always did the same thing.  He can at me with a right hook and I easily ducked underneath it with a leg swipe I assisted with a bar of air and Aaron fell flat on his back.  I had to say something.  I just had to.  "You'd think you'd have learned some different moves in these past ten years Aaron."

I held the large man down with a bar of air and my knee at his throat.  I smiled down at him.  "Do you want to try that again?  I'll give you a free shot."

He snapped his fingers and the others with him came at me.  I released my power and rush of air from my person knocking everyone back who was trying to attack me.  "Please.  You really think I'm going to let you win like I used to?  I don't have Dae'lin holding my strings anymore.  Do you want to try this again?"

I got up off Aaron and when I was several steps away I removed the bar of air.  "Come on.  Do you really want to fight me?  You are just gonna find yourself losing.  I'm sure you know that feeling well - being a loser."

Aaron rushed me like a bull.  He put his head down and I formed a wall of air between us and he rammed his harded headed brain into the air and I watched him bounce off the wall and fall on his back.  He was holding his head like it hurt.  "I can fix that if you like."  I started letting flows of all the elements extend from my fingers and he scrambled up and ran away with the rest of his flunkies.  I watched as they ran away like little cowards that they really were.  

I grabbed what was left of my tray and sat down in front of Dorian.  He looked sad.  "Is this how it always is with you?"

"You mean with Aaron?  Or just my attitude?"

Dorian smiled. "Aaron.  I'm well aware of your attitude."

"Yes.  He's always tried to bully me.  He always gets a few good licks in before I end it.  So I wouldn't get in trouble for starting it."

"He didn't get any in this time.  He wasn't very witty either."

I nodded.  "Never was."

I looked down at my tray and was disappointed that there was hardly anything on it.  I sighed and ate the single carrot and the tiny portion of chicken that had survived the flipping and didn't land on the floor before I had reacted.

"You want some of mine?" Dorian asked.

I shook my head.  "That's alright.  I'll get something later."

"Don't want to share?"  Dorin was faking a pout the big lip and everything.

I reached across and picked up his spoon and took a mouthful of the mashed potatoes and gravy.  It tasted like I'd remembered - not good.  "I'll make you some better that those."

"You cook?"  Dorian asked.

I nodded.  "Only way I can eat what I need to."

"Need to?"  Dorian grinned.  "You sound like a one of those health nuts."

"I suppose I am.  It's an OCPD thing.  Change is anxiety ridden.  I schedule just about everything.  Almost."  I smiled at him.  "It's hard to be spontaneous when you feel the need to have control over everything.  I try and I succeed somedays, but it usually means for the next few days or months I'm gonna be gung-ho about my schedule."

"I'll have to remember that."  Dorian pulled the papers from my laptop bag, helping himself to my personal possessions it seemed.
