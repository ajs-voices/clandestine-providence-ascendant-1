## Dreaming of Dorian

I laid down on my new bed and found it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.  It wasn't a cot so it really was better than what I slept on while out in the field.  My body hurt.  My stomach ached with hunger pains but the left over food Dorian and Mia had brought me was on the other side of the room and I didn't feel like calling a nurse in so I could eat yet again.

I closed my eyes and thought about the one person who had made my day today - Dorian.  Not only had he spent a majority of his day with me, he was intersted in thing I said.  Not that I didn't like listening to my own voice, but no one really ever listened when I said anything.  I was just that obnoxious kid who happened to be Cesari.  Everything else I was only detracted from me.  I was nothing amongst the Venatori.

I drifted to sleep with Dorian heavy on my mind.  The darkness overcame me as usual.  But it wasn't filled with the glowing eyes.  It was a happy scene - me and Dorian close, very close together our bodies interwined as much as humanly possible.  It felt good to be close to him - to someone who wanted more than just sex.

The darkness drifted in again on wisps and soft breezes until there was nothing left of the happy scene.  The glowing eyes grew and I fell into the darkness alone and afraid.  A meancing laugh echoed in the darkness.  Fire light everywhere surrounding me.  The glow of the fire made the shadows move.  I saw figures in front of me and I started awake the moment I saw the demon tentacles had embraced Dorian around the neck and he was limp like a rag doll.

My heart was pounding and my body was covered in sweat.  This was the first time my dreams had centered around hurting someone else.  I could hardly breathe.  

This was not how I had envisioned my life, dreaming of my own pain and suffering I was used to but now, it threatened Dorian.  I wanted to call him, but I didn't have my phone, which also meant I had no idea how long I'd slept.  I just knew it was dark and everything was quiet around me.  

So I got up and started doing push ups and sit ups and other things to keep my mind occupied, it hurt like hell, but the counting always helped. It was why it was a usualy go to when I couldn't sleep.  Some people thought I pushed myself too hard, but it really was a coping mechanism.  And tonight was no different.

Except this time it did little to calm my anxiety.  I tried to take deep breaths but I couldn't even focus on that through the pain.  I ended up sitting at the table in my room with a floating ball of light above my head as I sketched my nightmares on the notepad Dorian had brought for me.  It was probably the most detailed drawing I'd ever done for a dream.  The details screamed at me in my head, I couldn't shake them even as they were recorded on the paper in crayon.  

I didn't so much as feel the sun on my back but I could tell the sun had risen as things started to move outside my locked bedroom door.  A familiar beep sounded and Madison walked into my room and stopped just inside with the wheelchair she'd brought with her.  "What are you doing out of bed?"

I flipped the notebook closed and sighed.  "Nightmares."  She pushed the chair towards me and I stood up.  "I'll walk."  I could feel the pain in my legs radiate through my body as Madison frowned at me.

"No you won't."

"Yes I will."  I put my hand on the door frame and started walking towards the cafetria area.  "I won't be helpless anymore."

"Nox, you'll hurt yourself worse."  She hurried up with the chair still in front of her.  "Nox.  Sit down."

I shook my head and kept walking one foot in front of the other.  I made it to the table I was assigned and sat down.  My heart was racing, and my body ached from the exertion and I collapsed in the chair.  Madsion frowned at me as she left shaking her head.  

"You look tired."  The big black man sitting next to me said.

I grinned at him.  "Between nightmares and walking here I'm not so much tired as I hurt."

"Well why did you walk you idiot?"  Lori asked.

"Because I'm stubborn that way."  We were still waiting for Jo and Cliff and Ameilia to show up so I decided to fill the silence. "When are visiting hours?"

Lori giggled, "Why you expecting someone?"

I gave her my brightest smile, "Of course I am.  I'm popular.  And I was really hoping to get some from Dorian."  Which was not exactly a lie, but Lori turned the color a beat.  I hoped Dorian did as promised and slept and ate well, I could really use the help, I didn't want to walk anymore like this, but I didn't want to be pushed around either.  It was a no-win situation.

I looked at Duke and winked; he moved his chair away from me a few inches and his voice rumbled, "Don't get any ideas."

I laughed.  "I could show you a thing or two."

Jo took that moment to sit down with a curious look on her face.  "Do you flirt with everyone?"

I nodded.  "I try to.  But see that wasn't flirting, that was making my main man Duke here uncomfortable since he found my having sex with men uncomfortable.  It's a habit."  I turned to the big black man and smiled. "I'm sorry.  I will attempt behave myself."

Duke grumbled something that sounded like don't worry about it but it didn't really matter.  Cliff joined us and I offered my hand to Ameilia and brought it to my lips, "A pleasure as always Ameilia."

Lori giggled and Jo rolled her eyes.  Duke was the only one to comment, "You shouldn't realy encourage him."

I smiled.  "I encourage everyone to live their lives the way they wish to.  And since you don't particularly enjoy my advances at least someone else does."  I wanted to stick my tongue out at the big man but he rolled his eyes and me and I afraid he might actually try to hurt me.  

The medicine carts rolled through and everyone swallowed their pills.  I still felt wrong doing it.  I didn't need meds.  I hated faking it.

Breakfast arrived, a perfectly cooked frata that had Jo and Lori oggling and this time I did stick out my tongue at them.  "Mine."  I covered my plate with my arms and grinned at them.  Jo pouted until I offered her a fork full of my food which she took  delicately with her fingers and pulled it off my fork before tossing it in her mouth.  Lori pouted and I handed her a peice too. They both looked at me with delight.

I took a bit and found it passable, not the best I'd had.  "I make better."

Both of the girls eyes shot open, and Jo asked, "You cook?"

I nodded and waved my hands over my body, "You think a bod like this comes from eating fried food and grease laden cafeteria food?"

Both girls burned a light shade of pink before they settled into eating their own food.  I finished mine in three more bites and was still starving.  This was not good.  I was still draining too many resources.  I could barely move, my ability was scant.  I wasn't like it at all.  I disliked being disconnected from who I was.

Madison interrupted our breakfast, "Nox, Dorian is here.  He's in  your room waiting.  He said he didn't have long."

I nodded.  "I'll get there on my own."

Madison only shook her head.  "Bull headed boy still."

I grinned at her.  "Yup."  I turned to my table with a wicked grin.  "I'm off to see the wizard."  And I got up slowly and walked - rather I hobbled to my room.  It didn't take me as long to get back as it had to get there, the food supplying much needed energy.

I stood in the doorway while Dorian was staring at the drawing I'd been working on.  "Hey you."  I smiled.

Dorian looked at me with a frown and flipped the notebook closed.  He took me by the arm and sat me down on the bed with a furious glance.  "Why are you up?"

"Because I can't stand being wheeled around."  I said flatly.  "You aren't even going to ask what that was in the journal?"

"I presumed a nightmare.  Am I wrong?"  Dorian said with confidence.

"No.  But it's not my normal nightmare.  I don't normally dream about you like that."  I grinned at him as he helped me lie down.  There were very few rods exchanged as I saw Dorian start practicing the patterns need to heal me and he set to work.

I could feel the pain of the bones healing, and the muscled strengthing.  It was crude and painful and I wanted to scream but I didn't, I didn't want Dorian to stop.  When he did it was like a crushing weight had been lifted from my entire body but I sat up without help and only a small twinge of pain.

Dorian looked a little tired.  "I'm sorry that it saps so much strength."

Dorian grinned at me and put his hand on my knee closest to him. "It's okay.  You needed it.  You already look better.  I'm only glad to help."  He stood up and offered me a hand to stand which I took gratefully but not because I needed the help but because I wanted to touch him.  He pulled me close, "You dream about me?"

I bit my bottom lip and lowered my eyes and nodded.  Playing coy wasn't a usual thing for me but with Dorian it happened without a thought.  "It's mostly day dreams, last night was the first dream and it turned horrible.  I wanted to talk to you so badly last night but I don't have a phone."

Dorian sighed, "I'm sorry."

I grinned up at him.  "It's not your fault.  I'll learn to deal with it.  I'm not used to worrying about someone else like that."

Dorian smiled, "Now you know how I feel."  He pressed his lips softly against mine, it was a just a small kiss before he pulled away.  "I have to do alot of catch up from yesterday.  I will stop by for lunch.  I already made sure that was alright."

I nodded.  "Okay."  I caught his hand as he turned to walk away.  He looked back at me.  "Thank you Dorian."

He kissed me again softly this time there was a lot more behind it but it was still too short.  But a throat cleared in the hall and Dorian smiled as he pulled away.  "I'll see you at lunch."

Jo stood in the doorway and stepped aside as Dorian left.  "He's cute."

I sat down on the bed and waved her in, "He's more than cute Duckling."  Jo sat down next to me on the bed which was a bit of a surprise, "What's up?"
