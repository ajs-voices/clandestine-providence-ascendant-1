## Phoenix

There was nothing but flames and the pain.  I must have blacked out at some point because I woke up in the pack bed with Jo and Raf curled around me.  I knew someone else was there, but I didn't know who.  I sat up and felt my skin stretch as the newborn skin was taunt, it wasn't painful.  As a matter of fact there was no pain at all, just the presence tickling in the shadows.  

I created a low light ball above my head and in the corner sat the one person I hadn't expected.  His eyes were closed and his chest rose and fell with the shallowness of sleep.  Dorian shouldn't be here.

I moved toward the end of the large bed and Raf and Jo curled around each other with my presence gone.  I was a little cold now without their warmth.  I touched Dorian's shoulder and he stirred, looking up at me the started awake.  His wide blue eyes taking in the sight before him.  I smiled at him and took his hand.  He followed if a little slower than normal.  I lead him out back into the small garden where Emily planted roses and fresh herbs.  I sat down in the small patch of grass and waved for Dorian to sit in the lone chair the space had room for.

I asked softly, "What are you doing here? Your father said you'd moved on."

Dorian frowned.  "Why do you think I'm here?  Your father said he killed you.  They didn't stay to see your corpse.  I went to tend you and found nothing but ash.  I had thought the worst until Ant wisked me away to you. That is not a pleasant thing."

"You remember what they told me right?  I was immortal.  I guess we just proved it again."  I sighed as I laid back in the cool green grass that looked like black spikes sticking up from the ground.  I put my hands behind my head and stared up at the noise pollution blocking the view of the billions of stars I knew that were overhead.  "I'm fine Dorian, why are you still here?"

"I wanted to see you.  I..."  Dorian just stopped talking and when I looked over at him he was just watching me.

"You what, Dorian?"  I asked softly looking back up at the night sky.

"My father doesn't know the whole truth - I didn't move on, not exactly."

I sat up and looked at the man I loved and hoped that he had loved me back, but that felt like so long ago.  He frowned.  "Asher Eriksen came to me, told me what you were doing for me.  Told me what you were doing for Mark Green.  He said the only way to protect myself and my family was to move on.  He said it with a smile that indicated it would be a lie.  He told me that you'd arranged a child with Anabel Dowager, and she was willing to be a participant in an unsual means of conception.  Unsual for Venatori that is - humans do it all the time."

I smiled.  "My donations."

Dorian nodded.  "And to insure that my obligations were met, he had me marry Anabel, beget her son, your son and pretend like I had moved on.  I do not love her, Nox."

I smiled up at the sky.  "I know.  But I'm glad to her you say that.  You are going to be father my children?"

"At least one."  Dorian nodded though he looked sad.

"I can live with that."  I patted the ground next to me and Dorian slide out of his chair and laid down next to me, propping his head up on his hand staring down at me from his side.  I smiled at him.  "Why are you here?"

Dorian leaned down and kissed me tenderly.  "I've missed you."

"No one can know you are here Dorian.  Why risk these few moments?"  I asked then added, "Not that I mind seeing your beautiful face and those goregous eyes."

Dorian smiled, "Only the people here and Ant know where I'm at.  I left without saying a word to anyone and Ant wisked me away.  He loves you in that brotherly way you love Jason."

"I know.  We have a bit in common.  Kindred spirits and all that."

We sat in silence for a long time, just staring at each other without even touching.  Dorian smiled down at me, "Do you feel different?"

I shook my head, "No.  Skin feels tight but I suppose burning alive would do that to you."

Dorian stood up and offered me a hand and he lead me to my bedroom and stood me in front of the mirror.  He whispered, "Notice anything different?"

My hair was it's normal chocolate brown, all trace of color was gone despite the sapphire blue that had been in it when I went to meet with my father and the vampires.  And then I noticed the scar on my check was gone.  I touched the place it used to be tenatively and found nothing.  I could see Dorian smiling behind me as I pulled my shirt off, the scar on my forearm was gone as well and so was the werebear scratch across my chest.

I turned halfway and stared at what I could see of my back.  Every scar, every trama I had faced was erased by the fire.  Dorian looked at me with concern, "Do you feel different now?"

I spoke in a soft whisper, too afraid of my own voice, "There is nothing left."

"Nothing left on the outside Nox.  The scars run deeper than the flesh.  Do you feel different?"  He asked for the third time and I didn't hear any anger in his voice.

"I feel robbed.  No longer me."

"You are the same person, Nox.  The same man I love.  The same man who has tried to save countless supernatural lives.  The man who is standing her risen from the ashes like a phoenix."  He frowned, "The same man who I'm going to have to forget."

I turned and looked at him, "What do you mean?"

"The Venatori think you are dead now - well and good.  Asher thinks it's a good idea to let them think that.  I have informed him you were alright when I first arrived here.  He only laughed.  When he calmed down he told me to ask Ant to remove the memory of your survival.  To let me think you had died to make it beleivable.  They both gave me tonight to spend with you.  And I agree with them."

"So this is our last moments together?"

Dorian nodded, "Yes love.  And I won't remember them.  Please know that I love you."

"I know.  And I love you.  I understand.  I hate it but I understand."  I kissed Dorian.

His phone beeped.  "That's Ant.  I have to go love."

Dorian gave me one last kiss and smiled.  "Don't move on, Nox.  When it's over, all over, find me.  Tell me you love me and I will remember."

I nodded and watched Dorian leave my bedroom.  It felt like a hole being ripped through my heart.  I sat on my bed and I could feel the anxiety racing.  It wasn't long before Jo and Raf were helping me lie down and curling around me in my bed, it was barely big enough for me, much less three grown people, but somehow it worked and I drifted to sleep in a tangle of limbs thinking that I was going to drown in my sorrow.
