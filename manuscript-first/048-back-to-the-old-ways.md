## Back To the Old Ways

I caught a train down into a neighborhood I hadn't been in over ten years.  I hoped it was still as I remembered it.  Walking up from the platform brought back memories.  Jace holding my hand as he pulled me up the stairs the first time saying, "You'll love it I know you will."

I had loved it.  But my heart didn't feel it as I knocked on the familiar brown stone where loud music was pumping through at this late hour.  A man opened the door, his dark eyes taking me in, he rubbed his scruffy beard as recognition dawned on him and he smiled.  I asked, "Mind if I crash here tonight?"

Stephen reached around my shoulders and walked me into his apartment, "Anytime, mate."  Stephen was a displaced Aussie, he'd been her since I was a teenager - he wasn't much older than myself.  This was his brother's place.

He smashed the top of the stereo and the music cut of sharply and Stephen yelled, "Look who's gracing us with his presence."

The room turned to look at me and several faces smiled, the others turned back to what they were doing.  Gregory came up to me, Stephan's brother and shook my hand.  "Nox you are always welcome.  What no Jace?  I thought you two were insepearable."

"He's married you know."  As if that explained everything I needed to say.

Gregory took my things up the stairs, "You can crash with me."

I was about to protest as his long fingers snaked into mine and he tugged me after him.  "Come on, I'll show you the way."

I knew the way, it hadn't changed since my Ad Aetatem when I slept with him for the first and only time.  I sighed.  I hoped he didn't expect me to be the same person.

He dropped my bags on the floor and he smiled at me and shut the door behind him turning the lock before he sat down in the desk chair by his computer.  "You look like shit man.  I didn't think you'd want to be down there with them.  Even though I'm sure you could find a pick me up there."

I flopped down on his bed and sighed.  "Thanks."

Gregory asked, "What's wrong man?  Tattoo's different."

I sighed.  "Punishment."  Gregory and Stephen werewolves - had been one their entire lives.

He shook his head.  "What you do?"

"I'd rather not talk about it."  I sat up and looked at Gregory.  "But what is killing me is the fact that I'd found the perfect man.  Someone I wanted to be with, and now because of the shit things that have hapened in my life and the actions I took to protect him, I won't be able to see him again."

Gregory shook his head, "I can't see you with anyone long term.  Just not possible unless it was Jace."

"I don't love Jace like that."  I sighed.

"We all know that."  Gregory stood up and patted my knee as he headed for the door.  "I'm not looking for handouts.  You can stay here as long as you need, man."

I knew what he meant as he left and I closed my eyes as he flipped the lights off.  I drifted into a the bleakness of my own mind.  Instead of the red glowing eyes I saw images of my failure dancing in my head.  Dorian lifeless in his bed.  Aidan's throat cut and Stella screaming as Garrett forced himself upon her.  I opened my eyes and found the clock only a few hours ahead of where it had been before.

I got up and went downstairs. The thumping music was beating a hole in my memories and as I hit the bottom step I was enveloped in the familiar sights of my childhood.  In the kitchen people were playing drinking games, on the couch a few couples were making out.  There were the stoners getting high in the corner and Stephen was all over a girl.  Gregory sat in the back of the kitchen on the counter staring out over the crowd talking with a girl.  

I wound my way through the kitchen picking up a beer as I passed the table.  I got a weird look from the guy I'd taken it from but he didn't say anything as he took his friend's.  I took a sip and stood next to Gregory who had nodded at my approach.  The girl parted ways with a breif kiss on the check.  I laughed.  "Not your type?"

Gregory smiled.  "Plenty my type.  But that's Michael's sister she was updating me on his status."

"Dead in jail?"

Gregory frowned.  "How'd you know?"

I smiled.  "I heard her."

Gregory shook his head.  "Not surprised really.  He pisses off everyone he meets.  But he was loyal to a fault, never narc'd on Holly and that's who they were after."

"Holly was too smart to get caught.  Shame she got gunned down."

"Tis the life she lead and the drug lords she pissed off."  Gregory frowned then turned to look at me with a shy grin.  "Dance with me?"

I raised an eyebrow.  "You remember what I told you earlier, right?"  He nodded and smiled as he hopped off the counter and offered me his hand.  "Fine.  But I'm not sleeping with you."

I took his hand with my free one and he pulled me towards what was the make shift dance floor of his apartment.  He pulled me against his body and wrapped an arm around my waist.  I slung my empty hand over his shoulder and around his neck.  It wasn't the first time we'd danced together.  If it were anyone other than Gregory it might have been construed as prelude to somethng more to come, both of us let them think what they wanted.  I was sharing his bed tonight as it was.

I let my mind wander in the thrumming beat of the music and the feel of Gregory against me.  It was strange yet familiar, like I'd come home to an old friend.  Thoughts of Dorian filling my mind as I danced with Gregory in away I would never dream of dancing with Dorian.  Unless he wanted me to, that was.

I think Stephen filled my cup several times. I was feeling a little sloshed and hanging slightly from Gregory's body as he grinned down at me.  He was laughing at me.  "I don't think I've seen you lose control, this shit is really messing you up."

I glanced around and the party had vacated to wherever they went to next.  I could hear Stephen upstairs with his girl over the music but Gregory was still dancing with me.  I pulled away and frowned.  "I think your brother kept filling my cup."

"You were lost somewhere, barely even here with me."  He didn't sound offended.  "He's a lucky guy.  We can go to bed, or keep dancing."  He took the cup from my hand and smiled. "Though I think you've had enough."

I gave him a wry smile.  "You are very nice for me not wanting to be here with you."

Gregory laughed, "It's not like it's the first time I've filled a need for you."  He blushed furiously.  "I will always remember that."

I grinned playfully.  "I hope so. I was your first."

He rolled his eyes.  "My first fuck in the ass maybe."

I winked and kissed his neck.  "That's all I meant."  I whispered. "Thank you for understanding."

He pulled me closer our bodies pressed together tightly as he started moving again.  Dancing was comforting and Gregory knew it.  I don't know how long we danced into the night, but Gregory stopped with a yawn and took my hand and led me up the stairs and he crawled into bed stretching out luxuriously and patted the bed.  "I'll behave."

I sighed looking at the man below me and frowned.  He wasn't beautiful like Dorian was but he was comfortable.  I knew the swell of his back, the tease of his abdomen.  I could easily lose myself in him for one night.  I ran my eyes over his body wanting to touch him and swallowed hard.  In a lust filled whisper, "I'm not worried about you."

Gregory chuckled and patted the bed next to him.  "You love this guy..."

I interrupted, "His name is Dorian."

Gregory nodded and patted the bed.  "You love Dorian.  And you don't do anything half assed, so get your ass in my bed and go to sleep.  Dream of your beau and forget your worries for one night.  I won't let anything happen to you."

I doubted Gregory would be able to protect me from my nightmares but I laid down anyway with a man who was more than happy to be my friend.  Why could I be friends with so many supernatural creatures and hate my own people or them hate me?
