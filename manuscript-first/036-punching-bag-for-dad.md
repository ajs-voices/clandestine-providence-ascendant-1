## Punching Bag for Dad

I don't know how long I stood there but I felt a small hand on my leg.  "Can you take me to lunch?"

I looked down and saw those orange eyes staring up and me and I had to smile.  "I can.  Do you mind if I have a friend with me?"

He shook his head and smiled and raised his hands for me to pick him up which I did.  I dialed Dorian, he answered, "Nox?"

"Hey Dorian.  You have lunch plans?  I have a little dragon here who wants to grab some food with me and I could really use your company."

"Sure.  Meet you in the cafeteria?"  Dorian asked.

"Sounds good.  See you in a few."  I hung up and shifted Drake to carry him better.  "You ready?"

He nodded and I looked at Helen.  "This alright?"

She nodded.  "He and I usually go to lunch together."

"Alright.  Come on little man."  We made it to the cafeteria ahead of Dorian and we stood at he entrance waiting for him to show up.  Several people passed us with strange looks.  Apparently myself and this little dragon drew alot of looks.

Dorian snuck up on me and kissed my cheek and Drake gave a little squeek.  "Hey love.  This is Drake.  Drake, this is my boyfriend Dorian, he's going to eat lunch with us.  Is that okay?"

Drake nodded.  "He smells like cookies."

I grinned.  "I know isn't it great?"

"I what?"  Dorian asked.

I wrapped my arm around Dorian and we walked into the cafeteria.  I told Dorian, "You smell like cinnamon and vanilla, kinda like cookies." I whispered, "And I love it."

"I've never been told that before."  He rubbed the top of Drake's head.  "You smell like Nox, Drake - a campfire, the kind you make hotdogs and smores on."

"I've never had smores."

"No?"  Dorian asked.

Drake shook his head.  Dorian grinned.  "We'll have to fix that then.  Maybe you can come spend the night with us with Aidan and we can have a cookout."

Drake nodded with eagerness.

We stood in line and were through it before Ms. Shelia saw me and grinned as she saw me carrying Drake on my hip and Dorian's hand on my waist.  We sat down at an empty table.  We were talking to Drake when I saw a familiar form approaching.  I was about to stand up when another one stepped up behind me and put his hand on my shoulder.  "Hey, Aaron," my father said.

Aaron stopped and looked at my father.  "Mr. Viddens.  I was just passing through."

He stepped around Kai with a dirty glance in my general direction.  My father sat down next to Dorian.  "Who's this, Nox?"

I smiled at my father.  "His name is Drake.  Drake, this is my dad, Kai Viddens."

Drake blinked his orange eyes at my father as he ate his lunch.  "Drake doesn't talk much to strangers."

Kai smiled.  "That's alright."  He looked up at me. "Nox, was wondering if you wanted to hit the gym after lunch, get some of those skill squared away after your lax training these past few months."

"Are you offering to help?"

"Yeah.  You are my son."  He said with no sense of irony.

Dorian reached across the table and patted my hand.  "Drake and I'll be fine.  Go on."

I looked at Drake, "That okay with you?"

He nodded and pulled me close so he could whisper in my ear.  "I like Dorian."

I smiled at him.  "Me too."

"Alright.  Let's go."  I stood up and walked around the table.  I bent down and kissed Dorian softly on the lips and could taste the sickly sweet soda taste on his lips but I didn't care as he pulled every breath from my body in that tiny kiss.  I pulled away and grinned at him.  "Damn."  I whispred to him.  I bit my bottom lip before I kissed him on the forehead and waved at Drake.  "See ya tomorrow buddy."  I put my hand on Dorian's shoulder, "See you later love."

Kai followed me down the aisle of tables and all I could hear were the hushed whisperes that echoed in the chaos of the cafeteria.  Kai laughed as we exited, "You'd think they'd never seen someone kiss someone before."

I smiled.  "They've never seen Dorian kiss anyone, and especially not someone like me."

"You love him don't you?" Kai asked.

"Yeah. I do.  It scares the fuck out of me too."  I confided in my father for the frist time in my life.  

Kai put his hand on my shoulder and squeezed.  "It scares everyone.  Margo told me that she had to tell you we were seeing each other."  I nodded.  "Your thoughts?  She said you seemed angry."

"I wasn't angry at you or her. I was angry that they used it against her to pull her off my case.  She's been my therapist longer than you've know I've existed.  To think she didn't have my best interest at heart is a crock of shit."

Kai nodded. "It is, but you are out now."

"Only because I threatened the doctor who was poisoning me."  I could feel the fury rising.  "I could really use a good match."

Kai laughed.  "It's a good thing I'm here then."

We walked in relative silence the rest of the way to the gym Kai wanted to use.  It was more just a ring in a room - meant for teaching kids the basics, but it would work well for our purposes.  We warmed up with stretches and before we knew it we were dancing around each other in the sparring ring.  

I was completely absorbed in the fight until I caught the soft scent of cookies drifting my dirction.  I glanced in the direction of the door and saw Dorian and Drake watching silently, but that had been a mistake and Kai landed several blows before I fell backwards.  He shook his head, "You are easily distracted boy."

I sighed as I took my father's offered hand for assistance up.  "Sorry.  I didn't expect an audience."

Dorian chuckled.  "I can leave if you'd prefer.  Drake wanted to watch what you were doing though."

I shrugged.  "I'm good, just didn't expect it.  We good?  Again?"

Kai nodded and started circling me again.  We went around three or four times before I attacked my father with several jabs and a round house.  None really connected well but he was grinning madly at me for my attempt at agression.  He let lose a series of punches and kicks all of which I blocked with either my body or a pillar of air.  

My father was full Venatori and his stamina was endless compared to mine.  Even in defensive positions I was growing weaker and the fact that I was still coming down from the poison in my system and the weakness from my months of inactivity. I was tired faster than I should have been, but I pushed until I could do no more.

I sank to the mat on my knees when my body refused to move anymore.  Kai nodded.  "Considering.  That was well done son.  Rest tomorrow and we'll go again."

I nodded and my dad headed for the door and knelt down in front of Drake.  "Can I take you back to class.  Let Dorian take care of Nox?  I think he needs a little help."

Drake nodded and took my father's hand and they left.  Dorian stood in the door way as I crumpled to the floor and lay staring up at the ceiling.  He chuckled at me.  "Tired?"

I shook my head.  "That's an understatement."  I looked over at him and saw the amusement in his eyes.  "Help me up?"

Dorian walked over to me and offered me a hand and I let him pull me to my feet.  I stumbled into him, my knees still a little weak from exhaustion.  "I think I should eat again."

Dorian chuckled.  "All you do is eat anymore."

I shrugged.  "I can think of a few other things I'd like to do, but I really don't have the energy."

Dorian rolled his eyes as he pulled me close and kissed me.  My body relaxed into his and I nearly fell again, if it were not for Dorian's grasp on my waist I likely would have.  I chuckled between kisses.  "Well that a first."

Dorian pulled away and helped me steady myself, "What is?"

"A kiss making me weak in the knees."  

Dorian smiled at me.  "Happy to help."

I wanted to continue what we'd started the night before but I knew Dorian was in the middle of his day.  "I have dinner plans tonight, but can I stop by afterwards?"  I asked.

"Of course.  Can I ask with who?"

"Stella and Garrett..."
