## Elena

The address turned out to be a motel.  Not good. Last thing I needed was a rap sheet with a prostitution mark on it.  I went in and the lady saw me at the front desk and started to usher me out the door until the nice woman stepped in.  "Oh darling.  There you are."  She took me by the arm and lead me to a room.

The room was filled with her scent and I could clearly smell the forest now.  She had been good at masking what she was before now.  She closed the door behind her and opened the closet.  "Darling these are for you.  We have much to talk about.  Shower, shave.  Bask in the glory of what the Creed of  Celestial Beings can offer a lost soul like yourself. And we'll talk over diner."

I slide the hangers in the closet and saw a bunch of clothes that were too expensive for my tastes and several items that looked like they had better days.  I think they called that vintage.  "Why me?"

She caressed the tattoo on my temple with the tip of her finger nail and it sent shivers down my spine.  "Because of this."

"Because I've been exiled from the only thing I've ever known?"

She smiled at me with the red painted lips pressed neatly against her white teeth and I knew exactly what she was trying to do.  I'd done it several times myself.  She picked up my hands and turned them palm up.  "And these."

"My hands?"

"What you can do with your hands."  Her voice was like silk over my skin.

I laughed softly.  "You have no idea what I can do with my hands."

She placed my right hand simply on her hip and raised the other one to her lips. "Oh I've been watching you."  She kissed the ring on my finger.  "And you do such great things to protect your family."

I pulled away from her, "That sounds like a threat."

Her smile turned to a pout and only made her seduction hurt more.  "It wasn't a threat.  Garrett tried it, while it worked.  It is not my methods."

"So you want the same thing?"  I stared at her with daggers in my eyes.  They were really going to blantantly recruit me to kill my own kind again.

She shook her head.  "No.  And yes.  We do not want you to be the instruament of his death, but yes we want it.  What supernatural creature wouldn't want to cut off the head of the snake that has been slowly bleeding us."

"So you'll be no better than them?  You'll kill an innocent man because he leads the lot of hunters who make it their goal in life to kill your kind?  That sounds fabulous, like something I really want to be a part of. The Venatori are many things, but they beleive they are doing the right thing.  They just need to be re-educated.  You let them get away with teaching supernatural classes and think that will work.  All they teach you is how to spot one, how to kill them.  They teach us not so we can make peace, but so that we can kill you easier."

"Things need to change, but taking down the Venatori is not the answer.  They are built to take down a dragon, and a vampire and were's that go bad.  They are a great asset, but they need to learn they aren't the law."

She smiled at me with renewed vigor.  "I knew I had picked the right man."  She offered me her hand.  "Nox Sétanta, I am Elena Johnson and I would like to formally welcome you to the Creed of Celesital Beings.  The Venatori exiled you and watched you fall, the CCB will pick you up and you might be just the answer we've been looking for."

I took her hand a little afraid of the woman who had manipulated me so perfectly.  Her smile widened at my caution.  "This is yours for the night.  We will talk over dinner, and tomorrow we will show you to our recruit center and your new home.  There are several supplies in the bathroom you might find welcoming."  She reached up and ran her fingers through my hair, "You are missing much of your beautiful color.  I'd like to see it restored."

She gave me one last smile before she walked out into the hall.

I watched her go and then took a look around the room.  It wasn't much, but it was warm, the bed was soft and there were no bugs in it.  The sheets were clean and I felt gross just touching anything.  

I had been wearing one of my favorite shirts when I left Gregory's so many weeks ago.  I wished I hadn't, it was ragged and dirty beyond compare.  I pulled it over my head and walked into the bathroom and the bright lights above the mirror shown down on exactly what I'd become.  I could see my ribs through my chest, what muscle I had once had was now gone from lack of training and lack of food.  My hair ran into my face from where Elena had ruffled it.  It was too long everywhere, my beard was overgrown, though it could have been worse.  

The tattoo at my right temple was still red and angry.  I wondered if it would ever heal correctly, but as I'd told everyone else it was a punishment, so I doubted it.  

I looked like shit!

I removed my clothes and tossed them into the garbage can.  I turned the water and let the hot water scream through the shower head until the room fogged up and I stepped into the searing water.  The heat felt good against my aches and pains and seared away the dirt and grime and gross feeling I had.

I thik I used a whole bar of soap washing myself before I felt like I was clean again.  The bottles of shampoo and conditioner were gone.  By the time I was done with washng the water had run cold and I stood under the frigide water and let it fall on my face.  This was real.  This had become my life.  I couldn't go back to the Venatori even if I wanted to.  But did I really want to let myself fall into the cespool that would recruit my demon?  

There was a knock on the door and I turned the water off and yelled, "Be right there!" as I grabbed a towel and wrapped it around me and another to at least dry a little before answering the door.  But I hadn't needed to rush Elena was opening the door and her smile widened as she saw me walking out of the bathroom in nothing but the towel around my waist.  "You've just now gotten a shower?  It's been two hours."

I smiled.  "Um, no.  I've been in the shower for that long apparently."

She smiled and pulled a chair out.  "Sit and I will cut your hair.  I am sure you will feel better with that rag top out of your face."

"I like it in my face."  Though I did sit down, "Just not this much of it."

She walked into the bathroom and carried a basket of things out.  I hadn't even checked to see what was in it and was sad to find real bottles of shampoo and conditioner and a bottle of body wash.  "I suppose I should have looked in that before my shower."

She smiled, "Perhaps."  She set the basket on my lap.  "I've seen pictures.  I think I can get your usual style back if that's what you'd like"

"Yes ma'am".

Elena ran her fingers through my wet hair and started combing it like she'd done this a million times.  I asked.  "This what you do for a living?  A hair dresser I mean."

"It is one of the many things I do for the CCB."  I could feel her fingers against my head and the clippers pressing against the side of it as she carefully cut the undercut at the side of my head.  We sat in silence for several minutes with only the sounds of her shearing my hair from my head.  Her voice was soft and I could hear the concern she had in it as she spoke to me, "I'm surprised you hadn't sold the ring on your finger.  Even a little extra cash could go a long way on the streets."

I looked at the platnium ring on my left middle finger and smiled.  It was a little too big for me now and I hadn't even realized it.  "I can't sell it.  It's not mine to sell."

"Dorian gave it to you?"

"You know about Dorian?"  I could hear ths shock in my own voice.

"I know a great many things about you Nox Sétanta.  A great many things.  Did Dorian give it to you?"  She asked again sweetly. 

"Yes."

"You should forget him, love.  He's Venatori." I could hear the venom in her voice as said Venatori.  I wanted to leave but I couldn't I had a mission to complete even if I didn't like this I had to do it.

"I can't forget him.  I dream about him every night.  I see his eyes when I'm awake.  He haunts me and I miss him for it."

"Such a romantic.  I never would have thought a frequenter of The famous Big O could be so romantic."

"I've not been part of that circle for years."

She laughed.  "And that is why Adrian Sheridan watches over your little wolf, and you stayed with two of his pack members when you first were exiled?"

"I had no where else to go, they are as close to friends that I get."  

"You have Anthony Giovanni and Marco Ferri but then you'd have to deal with Bernstein who I hear is trying to kill your father and Dorian's I might add."  Elena was indeed well informed.

She ran her fingers through my hair again and patted my head.  "That should do it love.  Now I will give you an hour to finish and change the reservation I made since you took so long in the shower."

I stood up and looked in the full length mirror and I could see Elena checking me out and I grinned.  "I don't need an hour."

She handed me a box of hair color.  "I said I'd like to see some color."

I laughed.  "The one good thing about being Cesari is I can do just about anything."  I pulled a section of hair into my fingers and twirled it carefully around.  "What color would you like?"

She raised an eyebrow.  "Your favorite color."

"Do you know what that is?"  I asked as I fulfilled the request.

She shook her head.  "It's a surprise."

I laughed and between my fingers my hair turned a bright shade of orange against the chocolate of the rest of my hair.  Elena laughed.  "If I could do that I would be rich!"

I winked at her and grabbed a few more strands and changed them to orange.  I added a few blue spikes the color of Dorian's eyes and smiled.  

Elena smiled.  "Perfect.  If you hurry we can still make the reservation."

I grabbed the eye liner and the razor and shaving cream and went back into the bathroom to shave and finish the last touches of my look.  It was amazing how much better I felt, and how much better I was going to feel when I was done with all of the prep work to be presentable.

Elena laid out a pair of black jeans, a saphire blue button down shirt and a black t-shirt with a pair of plaid boxers.  I shook my head at the outfit but I didn't hesitate.  The towel fell to the floor and I heard Elena gasp slightly at the sudden reveal.  My back was to her, but I think it was the frist time she noticed my back than for the sudden shock of my back side.

As I was pulling on my boxers I felt a touch along my spine and I froze.  "Who would ruin such a beautiful boy?"

I sighed, "Garrett Spencer.  Please don't touch me there."

Her hand jerked away.  "I'm sorry."

"Just don't do it again please.  Anywhere else, but there."  I pulled the boxers up and the t-shirt on before I spoke again.  "He made me do it, but I did it to myself.  It's part of the nightmares of my life.  I'm sure Garrett never mentioned them."

She shook her head and looked at me with horror on her face.  "He will pay, my love."

"I am not **your** love.  But thank you. And I think I can handle a little weasel like him."  I finished getting dressed in silence.  Everything fit well I was surprised, though the pants were a little too loose, I'd lost so much weight.  I was going to be a skeleton after a few more months.  

I offered Elena my hand.  "Dinner?"

Elena took it with a smile and she handed me the card key to my room before we left.
