## Falling

I ate two more courses after Asher left me.  The entry was a decadent pasta and shrimp dish I knew would be bad on my figure.  But I hadn't realized how ugh I had been starving myself these past four days.  Desert was a pumpkin sufle that I would have to learn how to make if I ever wanted to eat it again.  And I took the second meal with me.

But I didn't get too far with it before I saw a man with a small child sitting in an alley way underneath a cardboard box roof.  I handed the man the left over bag.  Paying it forward knowing what I was about to do was going to put me in a similar situation.

I sent Ant a text as I walked back to Gregory and Stephen ' place.  I asked him to meet me at Bonnie's diner.  

I knocked on the door and a small brunette with blue eyes opened the door and I smiled.  Then my heart sank.  I couldn't take Jo with me anymore than I could Dorian.  I hugged Jo and I could hear Adrian in the other room. I took her hand in mine and walked into the kitchen where the others were talking.

Adrian looked up at me and frowned when he saw the look on my face.  "That bad?"

I nodded. "I need you too look after Jo until I can finish this last mission."

Gregory shook his head.  "Going out with a bang."

"Actually.  It's more like 8 seconds of bliss."  They looked at me with confusion in their eyrs.  "Jace would have got it."

Adrian nodded.  "Just come back to us."

"I'll try."

I packed my bags and when I was on my way down the stairs a small line formed to see me off.  "This isn't goodbye.  So get out of my way."  I stuck my tongue out at the lot of them.  But none of the moved and I kissed them all - Jo a kiss to her cheek and all the others were slightly messier.  They had all been in my bed at one time or another.  I walked out the door and down the stairs before I turned around and looked back to see Adrian watching me.  I could see the sorrow on his face.  He knew what this meant.  I might not come back.  I saluted him and bowed with a flourish and he smiled.

I turned and went to the diner across from the AU building to meet Ant at sundown.  I was sitting in my normal place eating pumpkin pie when he showed up.  He sat across from me and frowned.  "What's wrong?" He asked.

"Did you see Dorian?"

Ant nodded and handed me a small box.  "He wanted you to have this."

I opened it to find a plain platinum ring inside.  I picked it up between two fingers and read the inscription "Always"

I wanted to cry and slipped it on my middle finger.  It was to big for any other.  

Ant laughed.  "He said if it was too big for his middle finger he can resize it easily. Seems he got it right the first time."

I smiled.  "I want you to look after him for me.  You don't have to be annoying about it.  But I'm going to do this last thing for the Venatori and I can't be worried about him."

Ant nodded. "Of course."

"I'm going to leave my things with you.  Including the phone.  I have to fall.  And it'll be easier with nothing to lean on.  I'll leave a message with Bonnie the first Monday of every month so you know I'm okay."  I took a deep breath. This was going to be hell.

"Okay.  You know how to find me if you need me."  Ant added, "And Marco too."

"Thanks."

Ant nodded at me with tearfilled eyes stood up grappling my bags and we waved a flourishing bow my way and walked out the diner. I was alone with my self.  First step work for my food.

I washed dishes for the pumpkin pie.  Which considering it was a punishment for not having money I had a good time chatting with Bonnie in the kitchen.

I ran for about a hour in one direction and then I found a spot where the homeless were gathering and found a spot.  A small black woman walked past me and found a damp spot to sit.  I offered her my spot and smiled at me and offered me a can
  I shook my head.  "Maybe next time."

I leaned against the wall and drifted to sleep.  My dreams were a chaotic mess and I started awake.  I didn't know the time so I decided to go for another run.  

When daylight came I went to central park to busk for a while.  My tricks were getting better and I made enough money for a bagel at a food cart in the park. I did the same for lunch and dinner.  I barely made enough to eat. 

I did the same thing for about a week until my stomach hurt from lack of food.  The second week I don't run anywhere. 

By the third week I was seriously  considering my options.   I reeked.   The money wasn't good enough for a shower. An older woman was walking past and I stepped into pace with her and asked, "do you know where a shelter is?"

She just kept on walking.   I dropped from her pace.  My perspective had certainly changed. I couldn't wait for it to rain.

In the middle of the fourth week the sky opened up. The rain was cold but I walked a mile in it before I found a balcony in a dry area to keep me dry.  I needed to shave badly but at least the rain washed some of the smell away.  My stomach rumbled but the weather would keep my paying viewers at bay so I stayed as dry as possible. 

The next day was nice and a lady walking past stopped to watch me.  She loomed at the Tao on my temple and frowned but she dropped money on the can with a note.   I didn't get to read or til that night but it was an address to a shelter

I was grateful but it wasn't close.  I walked the distance there and was grateful for a bed and a hot meal. I also managed a shower and to shave.   The color in my hair had long since faxed into the chocolate brown of my natural hair color.  The polish on my nails chipped long ago.   

The next few weeks I saw the same woman who have me the address walk by and drop money in my can and leave a different note each day. 

On this particular day I read the note while I ate half a sandwich from one of my viewres.  He stopped by near daily to watch the show. 

The note said meet me and gave me an address.  The note was written on a pamphlet for the CCB.  I had a pretty good feeling this is what I was waiting for.  I left my spot early and walked to the shelter and showered.  I still had a hang up about being dirty on a date even one that could get me killed.
