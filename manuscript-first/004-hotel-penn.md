## Hotel Penn

We chatted on the short route to the LIE and on our way into the city.  I asked, "Where did they put you up?"

Stella nodded towards the GPS display on the dash.  "Hotel Pennsylvania."

I whistled.  "Posh.  Your ex must have some pull."

Stella shrugged.  "I dunno.  Why is it fancy?"

I nodded.  "Yeah, fancy is a word for it."

"How far is it from the building?"  Stella asked.

"About a 15 minute walk.  You can catch a train and make it in half that.  But really no point in it."

"So I really don't have to drive too far to drop you off." Stella seemed surprised.

"You can take me to the hotel.  I'll walk from there."  I would enjoy the walk.  I hadn't walked in my home town in many years.

"No.  I can drop you off, it'll let me see the building."

"I'd rather walk."  I insisted.  "Walking is good, it'll give me time to think."

"You need time to think?"  Stella asked.

"Always.  It's Sunday and I have a big presentation tomorrow.  I will miss my weekly check-in with my therapist and that's going to throw a whole new kink into the works." 

"Your therapist?"  Stella giggled.  "Your dad trying to straight you out?"

I shook my head.  "No, ma'am.  I've been in therapy since I was six.  The drama with my mother was only worsed by a year of ... well not so good treatment.  There was an accident and to insure it was really an accident they had me in pschye eval for a while.  I've continued the sessions because the PTSD and the OCPD never really went away.  I cope and manage everyday."

"Sounds rough.  Any other acryonyms you want to toss out there?"

I laughed.  "None that need to be said."

She grinned at me.  "So you have someone back home?"

I turned to look at the little red head driving.  "Are you asking me if I have a girlfriend?"

Stella blushed answering my question without answering.

"No.  Nor do I have a boyfriend.  I don't do relationships.  But for the record, this is home.  There is work."

Stella frowned.  "What are you a monk?  'I don't do relationships.'"  She laughed but it wasn't an I find you humorous laugh it was nervous and worried.

I leaned back in my chair.  "No, not a monk or celabate.  I've had plenty of sexual partners since I was 13 years old.  Just no relationships."

"That sounds lonely."  Stella sounded sad.

"Maybe.  But no one can hurt you if you don't let them in."  I said as I stared off into the distance watching the city draw near.

"That sounds really lonely."

I shrugged and we rode the rest of the way in silence.

Stella pulled up into the parking garage nearest the hotel and parked her rental car and got out and started to pull out our things from the back.  I got out slowly.  I had not intended to sleep with her, but now that I was fairly certain that particular card was off the table I was wanting to persuade her to let me into her bed.

I heard a squawk from the back seat and opened the rear door I had just passed and unbelted Aidan and shifted him to my hip and he clung to me like he was used to doing it.  His head was leaned against my shoulder and his little hand played little circles on my shoulder blade.  

Stella looked up and smiled shaking her head.  I asked, "What?"

Stella handed me my duffle bag and gear bag and took her son fro me.  "Nothing.  You look good with kids."

I grinned at her.  "Thanks."  But the reminder that she had a son had tempered my prior emotions.  I was okay with that which was odd.  "I'll help you inside if that's alright?"

Stella nodded.  "I'd like that.  I think Aidan would too."

We walked to the hotel which was across the street and down the block.  Stella hadn't wanted to use valet, something about not feeling right.  We got to the door of the hotel and the door man kindly opened it up and I followed Stella inside to the desk.  A bell hop brought a cart over and I set Stella's things on it and he stood there waiting for room number and information.  

The woman at the desk was a pretty blonde and I smiled at her as I stood behind Stella waiting for her to get through.  She turned and handed me a squirming Aidan, "Can you hold him while I do this.  He's being a worm."

"Sure." It wasn't like I had a choice in the matter she'd pretty much thrust him in my arms to begin with.  I tickled the little man in my arms and he giggled and squrimed until his mother returned pulling him gently from my arms.  

Stella looked at the bellhop and handed him a ten and said, "503."  He nodded and started for the elevator.  Stella looked at me with a grin.  "Do you want to come up?"

I looked at my phone for the time and decided that I did have time.  But I said, "I really shouldn't."  What the fuck was I doing, turning down this girl.

She smiled at me.  "Please?  You can tell me more about Apex Unlimited and we can order in while Aidan takes a nap.  I could use the company."

I looked at my phone again hoping that I could find some way out of it but there was nothing.  "Alright, I have time before Jace leaves.  I'll have him pick me up here."

We approached the elevator and I had to swallow hard as I stepped into the small cramped space with the bellhop cart, and two other adults inside.  I closed my eyes and clutched the metal rail.  Stella placed her warm hand on top of mine, "Don't like elevators either?"

I shrugged.  "I don't like heights at all."

I could feel the small woman step closer to me and pressed her leg against mine and Aidan climbed into my arms.  I had no other choice but to wrap my arm around him and around Stella's shoulder.  She settled against me with ease and I could feel the all to familiar tightness increase.  I thought to myself _I don't do relationships that's what she wants._

By the time the elevator stopped my heart was racing for more than one reason.  I was the last one off the elevator I followed Stella and the bellhop to her room and I was ready to leave.  I had to leave before she got the wrong impression.

Stella opened the door and the bellhop took our things into her room.  I took a deep breath and stepped inside.  The room was lavious and smelled clean.  I found no hints of any other odors not even the scent of cleaning fluid.  It was perfect.

I looked around while Stella unpacked.  I set Aidan down and he squawked and bounced with his hands in the air.  "Up," he demanded.

I lifted the little boy back up and moved to sit down on the couch.  He slayed himself on top of me and was soon snoring softly against my shoulder.

Stella smiled as she came and gently lifted him from me and took him to the play pen she'd set up.  I noticed a small patch of drool on my shirt.  It wasn't the first time, and it wasn't likely the last but without Aidan to create a buffer I was feeling axious.  And I don't get anxious around girls - even pretty ones.

Stella sat down next to me and I pulled my phone out I had to call Jace or I'd forget.  He picked up the phone quickly.  "Already?  Damn you are fast."

I laughed.  "Can you pick me up at Hotel Penn on your way home?"

I pulled the phone away from my ear and glanced at the time.  I still had time.  My hearts started to race faster.  Fuck.  

Jace answered.  I'd missed part of it, but I got the part I needed.  "I'll be there at 5pm sharp.  Don't be late."

"I'll be the one outside with my leg showing."

Stella giggled.  

Jace laughed.  "Don't do anything I wouldn't do."

"Bye Jace."

We hung up and Stella reached down and pulled my pant leg up.  She sighed.  "I thought you might have shaved."

I rolled my eyes.  She ran her fingers under my eyes, "I mean you do wear make up and all."

Again I rolled my eyes.  She had manuevered herself to her knees and was too close.  And the look in her eyes said more than words every could.  And I had enjoyed her touching me.  All day she had been touching me and I had enjoyed her soft rose scent and her warm touch.  I missed the touch of others.  I had been out in the field too long alone.

A small sigh escaped as her fingers played with a fringe of dyed-red hair over my left eye.  She was flirting and she knew the reaction she was getting from me.  I said in a low husky voice filled with the lust I was feeling, "I don't do relationships."

She whispered, "I know," in my ear.  I could feal her silky breath on my skin.

"You aren't typically my type."

She pulled back and slapped me upside the head, "And what type is that?"

I sighed.  Fucked that up again.  "A single mother.  A mom with a toddler to look out for."

I stood up and took a step back from the couch.  "Stella, I have rules.  I don't sleep with married individuals.  I don't sleep with anyone who may want more out of me than just sex.  I don't do relationships."

Stella stood up and stepped closer to me and looked up.  "You sure know how to kill the mood.  What if I just wanted sex?"

I smiled down at her and took another step back.  "I'd have to ask you why?"

Her face turned red.  "I need a reason to want sex?"  She was angry now.

"Well.  No."  She advanced on me and I took a step back for every step she took towards me until her hands balled up in a fist and my back hit the wall.  Fuck.  A gear in my head slipped and I could feel the panic and the fear rising up.  I tried to explain myself but nothing coherent came out of my mouth.  "I...Um.."

Stella stood inches from me with her fists balled up and staring up at me with fury.  "Spit it out."

As commanded I spoke cleanly and clearly in the voice I hadn't heard in a long time.  "You don't need a reason, but I wouldn't think a parent like you would want a casual relationship around your son.  One based on sex and sex alone.  As a single parent I'd hope your priority was your son."

The anger rose in her and then as she looked at me pressed against the wall in fear she frowned and stepped back.  I felt a little lighter but the panic still coursed through my veins.  The fear was riding my mind and I was truly afraid of the little red head in front of me.  She cocked her head at me and sighed as she sat back down. "You really are messed up aren't you?"

I stayed pressed agains the wall only relaxing enough to shake my hands out.  "You have no idea."

Stella sat on the couch and wrung her hands in front of her.  "I'm sorry."  Her voice had cooled dramatically the prickling against my skin lessened and relaxed a little.  "Aidan liked you.  I liked you."  She turned a shade of crimson just slightly lighter than her hair.  "I figured if you were a player at least I could feel..."  She stammered.  "I've not been with anyone since Aidan's father left me."

I didn't know what to say.  So I apologized.  "I'm sorry."  I sighed.  "It's not that I don't want to.  God, I want to.  But you have a son." I took a step from the wall and then another until I was standing behind the couch Stella was sitting in.  "I don't want you to find what you are looking for in me.  I'm not the kinda guy who's going to stick around.  You need that guy.  Not me."

Stella continued to look at the floor.  I took a deep breath and bent over Stella's small form then kissed the top of her head.  I could smell the sweet scent of roses and I could feel that small tightening in my body again.  I whispered against everything my body was telling me.  "I'm going to go now."  

I took a card out of my wallet and set it on the table near the door.  "Call me after your interview, let me know how it went.  If you move here maybe I can show you around.  Have a play date with Aidan."  I grinned at her.

Stella looked up at me with tears in her eyes.  Fuck!  I hated crying, I was weak when girls cried.  But she smiled at me.  "I'd like that.  See ya round Nox."

"See ya round, Stella."  I opened the door and hefted my things to my shoulder and I headed for the nearest stair well.  It was no where near time for Jace to pick me up.  I'd tell him I was stopping back at HQ and find my new room to stop by there.  But first I had to get as far away from the prickling fear that was chasing me down the stairs.
